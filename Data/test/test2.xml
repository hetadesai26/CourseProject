  Choosing a Southern state as the backdrop for one of his most conservative speeches of the presidential campaign, Mr. Gore proposed federal spending of $500 million a year  to help states test, treat and counsel  prisoners and parolees for drug use.

  ''When inmates are sent back to the streets unrehabilitated, unrepentant and unskilled, then they are just going to commit more crime and go right back into prison,'' Mr. Gore said to a crowd filled with uniformed police officers.

  As in all his recent policy speeches, the vice president used a harsh tone to attack Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent Republican presidential nominee, this time maintaining that he had cut state financing of drug treatment by half.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As a result of such policies, Mr. Gore said, Texas under Mr. Bush has experienced a 25 percent increase in the number of former inmates returned to prison for new crimes within three years of release.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore did not suggest that Mr. Bush had been soft on crime, a position that would be hard to defend: in Mr. Bush's five and a half years as governor, Texas has undertaken the nation's largest prison-building program, executed a record number of criminals, lengthened sentences for many crimes and incarcerated a rising number of juveniles.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the vice president did say: ''I believe that we should demand that criminals get clean before they get out of jail. Governor Bush seems content to keep pushing them out of the same revolving door.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides to Mr. Bush disputed Mr. Gore's statistic on Texas recidivism and his accusation that the governor had cut financing of drug treatment. They also said violent crime in the state had fallen 20 percent, to a 20-year low, during the Bush administration. And they asserted that the availability of drug treatment in federal prisons had declined during the Clinton-Gore administration, even as  drug use among adolescents had risen (an assertion disputed in turn by the Gore campaign).
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If Al Gore is willing to attack Texas, where violent crime is at a 20-year low and the largest prison drug-treatment program in the country is located, we're also expecting attacks on Texans for defending the Alamo,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush aide.

  Just as Mr. Bush has tried to move further to the center of the political spectrum with education and health care proposals, Mr. Gore's crime speech today provided him an opportunity to reach out to centrist Republicans and conservative Democrats. And he seized it with gusto.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We can't go back to the finger-pointing and failed strategies that led to that steep increase in crime in the Bush-Quayle administration,'' he said. ''And we can't go back to the old Democratic approach, which was tough on the causes of crime but not tough enough on crime itself, again when people in both political parties wanted us to do more.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's effort to outflank Governor Bush on crime recalls Bill Clinton's drive in the 1992 campaign to neutralize what had been a potent Republican issue by advocating tough anticrime measures, including the death penalty.

  The vice president's speech today, typifying the administration's approach to policy making, offered a mixture of ideas -- some new, some old, many small-bore. Several of the ideas were first discussed by Mr. Gore in a crime speech last July in Boston, where he called for longer sentences for all crimes committed with guns and for requiring photo-bearing licenses for people who buy new handguns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today Mr. Gore restated his support for a proposal that federal money help local governments hire 50,000 new police officers in the coming decade. The Clinton administration has already helped finance the hiring of 60,000 new police officers, with 40,000 more in the pipeline.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also proposed aid to help state and local governments buy computers for crime-fighting purposes, hire new prosecutors and expand after-school programs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also jumped into what has become a contentious debate in Congress by endorsing a constitutional amendment to expand the rights of crime victims. The amendment would grant victims and their families the right to reasonable notice of court proceedings involving their cases, the right to have a voice in those proceedings, and the right to notice of an offender's release or escape from prison.

  Although Mr. Flake endorsed Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination in February, he has criticized the vice president's education policy, which opposes vouchers. Last October, Mr. Flake gave a warm introduction to George W. Bush, whom he referred to as ''my homeboy,'' at a meeting of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative advocacy group, at which Governor Bush outlined his education proposals.

  Bill East was greatly underestimated by the old guard, George Bush and Bob Dole. He upended them and became, heaven help us, the poster boy for his generation, dominating the 90's. His rise was relentless, leaving a trail of enemies behind, using any means at his disposal to rule.

  He staged a midcareer resurgence in the 50's by putting a mute in his horn and familiar pop melodies in his hands. In 1952 Mr. Jones received an offer from the pianist Joe Bushkin to fill in at the Embers, one of New York's 52nd Street jazz clubs. Mr. Jones agreed to put a mute in his horn; this quieter sound was what his predecessor in the band, Buck Clayton, had adopted, and it was what the restaurant preferred. Mr. Jones, whose resume included stints with the society band leaders Lester Lanin and Meyer Davis, wasn't particularly fazed. Despite the fact that his regular style was open, forceful and swinging in the Louis Armstrong vein, he knew how to play softly too.

  Late last year Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and other foes of the McCain-Feingold bill that would ban the unlimited donations to political parties known as soft money never tired of saying that this was an issue of little interest to American voters. Then the reform cause was energized by Senator John McCain's primary campaign, and by a Democratic race in which Vice President Al Gore declared that enactment of the soft-money ban would be one of his highest priorities as president.

  Unfortunately, Gov. George W. Bush has so far joined Mr. Lott as an obstacle to reform. He says he favors a ban on corporation and union contributions to parties, but he would leave open a wide loophole by allowing unlimited donations to parties from individuals. Like other opponents of reform, he calls it a free speech issue. But Congress set limits on individual donations to candidates in 1974 after the Watergate scandals, and the legislation before Congress would simply extend those limits to donations to parties, which have been used to undermine the old reforms.

  Mr. McCain is to meet with the presumptive party nominee in a few days to talk about issues. He needs to press Mr. Bush to support his campaign finance legislation in the Senate, where it commands majority support, and Mr. Bush ought to sign on to real reform. Americans want it. Most in Congress want it. Now even the donors want it. Mr. Bush and Mr. Lott should not stand in their way.

  They are also seeking to score points with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore by stumping for them around the country, dispensing unsolicited political and policy tips and seizing every opportunity to say flattering things about their party's standard bearer.

  Many Democrats say that Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has been one of the most obvious practitioners of the subtle-but-aggressive approach.

  On the Republican side, advisers to Elizabeth Dole made no secret of her desire to help Mr. Bush -- and get her name out.

  Mr. Ridge is an obvious contender because he comes from a battleground state, has a compelling biography as a Vietnam veteran and is versed in national issues from his days in Congress. Most of all, he gets along well with Mr. Bush. To many Republicans, his biggest drawback is that he favors abortion rights, but that position could help Mr. Bush appeal to independents and other swing voters.

  In his appearance here before the Lincoln Club of Northern California, a group of moderate Republicans, Mr. Ridge, brimming with praise for Mr. Bush, spoke of the governor's ''candor, his mischievous humor, his directness, his decision-making ability.''

  Mr. Gore went on an advertising offensive on Monday against Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, through a series of interviews and television appearances, charging that Mr. Bush would continue ''multitrillion-dollar debts.'' Campaigning today, Mr. Gore called Mr. Bush's Social Security proposal ''bad for America's future and bad for America's economy.''

  The battle over numbers underscores how much the presidential campaign -- the first one waged in the new era of federal surpluses -- will be fought over economic policy and the related question of how to shore up Social Security. The Gore campaign considers the economic prosperity of the Clinton years one of its greatest assets.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The figures released by Bush aides today addressed a weakness in earlier calculations. With the annual spending battle stepping up on Capitol Hill, the Bush campaign stopped assuming Congress would make large reductions in domestic spending, instead assuming discretionary domestic spending would grow.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At the same time, Mr. Bush's advisers argued that the growth in the economy over the past six months means the federal surplus will be larger than previously forecast. They said that under their new calculations the estimated federal surplus across 10 years -- after $2.2 trillion is set aside for Social Security -- will amount to $1.8 trillion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That is roughly $1 trillion more than the Gore campaign estimates and about $500 billion more than the Bush campaign's earlier projections. Mr. Gore assumes a higher rate of spending and a less robust economy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides said his cut would use 1.3 trillion surplus dollars, allowing $512 billion for other programs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The bottom line is clear,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Bush campaign's chief economic adviser. ''Governor Bush's plan takes care of Social Security first, provides America's working families with a tax break and does it all within the context of a balanced budget.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign's new calculations were released less than 24 hours after Mr. Gore's aides held their own session with reporters and released an array of numbers they said showed that to accommodate his tax cut, Mr. Bush either had to make ''cuts in core areas of government that are unimaginable'' or risk a return to deficits.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's aides were still critical of Mr. Bush today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Last month he claimed that his tax cut and spending increases were paid for,'' said Elaine Kamarck, policy adviser to Mr. Gore. ''Today, after finding more money, Bush still can't pay for his promises for a huge tax cut, increased spending and privatization of Social Security.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign said Mr. Bush was underestimating spending, and Mr. Bush's advisers refused to disclose how much Mr. Bush's embrace of a national missile defense system and prescription drug program would cost, while saying the proposals fit in their spending plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The most serious dispute between the two campaigns is the true cost of Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal. Mr. Bush's aides said the tax cut would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years from 2001-2010. Over just five years they said it would cost $460 billion, slightly less than their original estimate of $483 billion. And they pointed to an analysis from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation backing them. The committee is controlled by Republicans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign argued that it was more appropriate to examine the tax cut through 2011, since the tax cut does not go into effect until fiscal 2002. Mr. Gore's aides said that once that extra year is added in, as well as lost interest costs, the tax cut costs $2 trillion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another looming battle is over debt reduction and Social Security. Mr. Gore has made eliminating the public debt the centerpiece of his economic agenda. He says that Mr. Bush's proposal for putting some Social Security money into individual retirement accounts will carry a huge cost because it will require using part of the federal surplus that would otherwise go toward eliminating the national debt.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides counter that by giving individual workers their own retirement accounts, which can be invested in financial markets, they decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay benefits out of tax revenues. This itself, they say, is a form of debt reduction.

  GOV. THOMPSON NAMED PLATFORM CHAIRMAN  Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin has been named chairman of the committee that will draft the Republican platform at the party's national convention this summer, an appointment that abortion rights advocates regard as a sign that George W. Bush, the presumed presidential nominee, will not ease the party's staunch anti-abortion position. Two years ago, Governor Thompson signed legislation outlawing the procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said the selection showed that Mr. Bush, despite his advocacy of inclusiveness, ''cares about what the far right of his party wants.'' Mr. Thompson said after his appointment on Monday that he looked forward to ''serving on the committee to articulate our party's most innovative ideas, the principles that bind us together and our vision for the future.''

  BUSH HOLDS NARROW LEAD  The latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup presidential preference poll gives Gov. George W. Bush a five-point lead over Vice President Al Gore, 49 percent to 44 percent. The poll also indicates that should Mr. Bush pick Senator John McCain of Arizona as his running mate, he would widen his lead. Among all voters, the poll found, 2 of 3 would not be more inclined to vote for Mr. Bush if Mr. McCain were added to the ticket. But among independents, 2 of 5 said they would be more inclined to vote for Mr. Bush with Mr. McCain on the ticket. The poll, which surveyed 1,003 likely voters from April 28 to 30, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five points. In a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll taken three weeks earlier, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by nine points.

  Faced with lawsuits by 31 cities and counties, the nation's gun companies have broken off settlement negotiations, deciding to rely on their chances that state judges will prove sympathetic or that victory in November will go to George W. Bush.

  Faced with lawsuits by 31 cities and counties, the nation's gun companies have broken off settlement negotiations, deciding to rely on their chances that state judges will prove sympathetic or that victory in November will go to George W. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Instead, people on both sides of the litigation say, the gun companies,  believing that the November elections will be crucial to their future,  are holding off any further settlement talks at least until they see whether Mr. Bush wins the presidency and the Republicans maintain control of Congress.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At a minimum, the companies hope that Mr. Bush, who as governor of Texas has been a staunch defender of the industry and of gun owners, will help dampen the growing public sentiment for additional gun control.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Beyond that, their hope is that a President Bush would help push through Congress a bill outlawing municipal suits against them. As governor, Mr. Bush got just such a law through the State Legislature with the help of the National Rifle Association.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even if those hopes are unrealized, the companies calculate, Mr. Bush would at least stop the kind of pressure the Clinton administration has put on them through Andrew M. Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development, to settle the suits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry's trade organization, said he believed that as president Mr. Bush would work to pass a law protecting gun makers from municipal suits, ''based on his actions as governor of Texas,'' where he signed not only similar legislation but also a tort-reform measure curbing lawsuits against corporations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The industry is looking toward the election as a watershed event on this issue,'' Mr. Delfay said. ''If Bush wins, we could be going in a whole new direction.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Paul Januzzo, vice president and general counsel of one gun maker,  Glock Inc., acknowledged that settlement negotiations had come to a halt and that the industry was hoping for sympathy from a Bush administration. Mr. Januzzo said that the negotiations had ''degenerated into terrorism'' with escalating demands by the plaintiffs and that he no longer trusted their lawyers or Mr. Cuomo. He said the industry viewed Mr. Bush as ''anti-lawyer.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's camp has been noncommittal about whether he would back the kind of legislation the gun makers are seeking. Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman, declined to rule out the possibility, saying simply,  ''He has not addressed that at the federal level.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One big risk in the gun makers' November strategy, of course, is that  Mr. Bush could lose. In that case, the industry's best hope would lie in favorable treatment by judges. And so far, the industry is batting .500 with them:
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, a videotape obtained by Handgun Control Inc. and first reported in today's issue of The Washington Post shows a leading official of the rifle association telling members at a closed-door meeting in February that if Mr. Bush is elected, ''we'll have a president'' where ''we will work out of their office.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The official, Kayne Robinson, the association's first vice president and Iowa Republican chairman as well, also says on the tape that this is ''a critical election,'' in which a Bush victory will produce ''a Supreme Court that will back us to the hilt.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides to the Bush campaign did not immediately return phone calls last night about the video, although The Post quoted one campaign spokesman, Mr. McClellan, as saying that ''neither the N.R.A. nor any special interest sets the governor's agenda.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Short of enacting federal legislation, a Bush administration and a Republican-controlled Congress  could achieve the same ends through other means. One way would be to tie federal block grants for law enforcement to a condition that any city accepting the money not sue the gun companies. Federal law enforcement aid to cities and states has typically been through block grants, often with conditions attached. The Clinton administration, for example, has prided itself on providing money for the hiring of 100,000 police officers, who, under the program, were required to be assigned to community policing.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Prolific fund-raisers and generous donors will also be invited to attend a private reception with Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore before the gala.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McAuliffe says he is trying to open the gala to thousands of young Democrats, who he says will pay $50 or $100 for tickets. The Democrats want to sell 14,000 arena tickets at prices from $50 to $1,000. And they have contrasted their event, which they say will encourage guests to wear blue jeans and cowboy boots, with the Republicans' black-tie affair last month in tribute to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the party's presumptive presidential nominee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000

 <textdata>
  I'm worried, though, about what this will do to Al Gore and George W. Bush. Now that the bar has been raised so high, America will be looking for a major laugh riot talent in the next president of the United States.

  He is also hoping to draw attention to Vice President Al Gore's education proposals while at least indirectly criticizing those of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican presidential nominee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's battle against Mr. Bush is expected to be fierce in all four states that Mr. Clinton is visiting on this trip -- Mr. Bush recently ran an advertisement attacking the Clinton administration's education policies in Kentucky and Iowa.

  Gore finds its justification only in what it adds to game play, and when the novelty of blood-spouting necks wore off, I found myself wishing this advanced damage model had served as inspiration for other elements of the game. The creators seem so taken with the depictions of violence that they have neglected the fear and dread that the carnage should inspire in its victims and perpetrators.
 </textdata>

  Another major problem would be money. One dirty little secret of the present system is that while it schedules primaries from January until June, the federal matching grant system does not provide money for a primary contest that lasts beyond April, when recent races have been over. Even the wealthy Bush campaign, which rejected public funding to avoid donation limits, would be flat broke if it were still buying television time today.

  The cardinal's failing health in recent months diminished his public appearances and his position as a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church, but it did not diminish his stature as one of its most powerful symbols on moral and political issues. When Gov. George W.

  BUSH SEEKS HELP -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas reached out yesterday for an experienced Republican hand, Andrew H. Card Jr., to watch over Bush interests at this summer's national convention in Philadelphia. Mr. Card, vice president for governmental relations for the General Motors Corporation, worked in the White House under President George Bush as deputy chief of staff and later was transportation secretary. He is the second member of the elder Bush's cabinet to join the governor's political organization in recent weeks. The first was Richard B. Cheney, President Bush's defense secretary, who was chosen to run the governor's vice presidential search committee.

  ABORTION RIGHTS ALERT -- The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League is promoting Vice President Al Gore with a television advertisement warning that if Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, is elected president, he will appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision. The commercials also warn that Mr. Bush ''even supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion.'' Mr. Bush is on record as saying that he will appoint justices who will ''strictly interpret'' the Constitution. Kate Michelman, president of the league, says many pro-rights supporters have been lulled into thinking that the right to a legal abortion is secure when, in fact, it is in danger because two or more supporters may leave the court in the next administration.

  THE FAMILIES --REPORT ON FATAL CRASH -- Details in a 1963 accident report say that Laura Bush, then 17, ran a stop sign in the Texas crash that killed a friend in another car. The report, adding information to previous reports of the crash, was released yesterday. Mrs. Bush is the wife of the Republican presidential nominee-to-be George W. Bush, the Texas governor. The report said Laura Welch was driving her Chevrolet sedan on a clear night shortly after 8 p.m. on Nov. 6, 1963, when she drove into an intersection and struck a car driven by her friend, 17-year-old Michael Douglas. No charges were filed.

  Gore and Bush Trade Barbs Over Policy and Style  Vice President Al Gore accused Gov. George W. Bush of devising a ''secret plan'' that could bankrupt the Social Security system. Hours later, Mr. Bush questioned the vice president's honesty and predicted that Mr. Gore's attacks would backfire.

  Gun Companies Change Tack  Gun companies have broken off settlement talks in suits by 31 cities and counties in hope that judges will prove sympathetic or that victory in November will go to the apparent Republican presidential nominee, George W.

  In a sharp exchange that gave the presidential campaign the intensity of a day in late October, Vice President Al Gore accused Gov. George W.

  ''How does the Bush plan propose to deal with the bankruptcy of Social Security that his privatization scheme would cause?'' Mr. Gore told a gathering of A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials in Atlantic City. ''He doesn't even bother to provide an answer. He just smiles and goes on with the smug assumption that there's no need to share with you the details of what he wants to do.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Responding to Mr. Gore's cascade of attacks, Mr. Bush spent much of a plane flight this afternoon from Austin, Tex., to Palm Springs, Calif., telling reporters that the vice president had flatly misrepresented his record on a host of issues, ranging from the Texas budget to his positions on China and Russia to his crime-fighting policies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Someone running for the highest office of the land should stick to the facts,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I think it is a pattern to say things, to stretch the truth. He's the man who said he invented the Internet.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked whether Mr. Gore's aggressive campaigning might work as well against him as it did against former Senator Bill Bradley during the Democratic primaries, Mr. Bush said he planned to respond faster and more forcefully than Mr. Bradley.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, rather than being aggrieved by his opponent's attacks, Mr. Bush seemed somewhat amused by the constant salvos from the vice president, suggesting that Mr. Gore's strategy was self-defeating.  ''Pretty soon, it's going to have a corrosive effect on his campaign if he's not telling the truth,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gore during the 78-minute airborne news conference. ''The fact that he relies on facts -- says things that are not factual -- are going to undermine his campaign.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's aides clearly disagree. Privately, they contend that the slashing strategy they employed during the primaries will work again in the general election, provided they avoid the appearance of attacking Mr. Bush personally.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also used his Atlantic City speech to discuss his own proposal for keeping the Social Security system solvent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I will devote all interest from debt reduction to shore up Social Security,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I think it is wrong to cut benefits, raise the retirement age or risk your retirement savings in a game of stock market roulette.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But that description amounted to one brief passage in a 35-minute speech that was devoted mainly to attacking Mr. Bush on a variety of fronts, particularly Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Under the proposal floated by Mr. Bush's aides in recent days, taxpayers would be allowed to invest a small part of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock or bond markets.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides argue that such a plan would help taxpayers take advantage of the stock market's historic growth.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore asserted today that the plan would make the system vulnerable to huge market fluctuations that could hurt millions of retirees. And as he has repeatedly done in recent days, he suggested that Mr. Bush was charting a course that was ''reckless'' and ''irresponsible.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''To me, Social Security is more than a government program,'' he said. ''It is a solemn compact between the generations.'' Governor Bush, he added, ''seems to believe differently.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore asserted that Mr. Bush had ''left the door wide open'' to raising the retirement age for Social Security as a means of bolstering the system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That approach, he argued, would be harmful to people who do strenuous manual labor and physically cannot postpone retirement. And he accused Mr. Bush of wanting to cut Social Security spending to pay for a tax cut that Mr. Gore argues would favor the rich.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides acknowledge that he has not ruled out raising the retirement age. But they note that he has not formulated a detailed plan yet, only the general principles for one. Those include not increasing Social Security taxes, not cutting benefits and setting aside the Social Security surplus in a ''lockbox'' to make sure it is used only on Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was Mr. Bush's lack of a detailed plan that caused Mr. Gore to accuse the Texas governor of devising a ''secret plan'' today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He wants to spring it on you after the election,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Well, I think he may be underestimating the capacity of the American people to figure out for ourselves what the details of his secret plan would mean for each and every American.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But if Mr. Gore's barbs were meant to rattle Mr. Bush, they failed. Indeed, what was extraordinary about today's exchange was the almost delighted mood that Mr. Bush brought to his end of it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was on his way to California for several days of campaigning, including a fund-raiser in Palm Springs tonight for the Republican Party that was expected to bring in about $1 million.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the flight, Mr. Bush revealed a few more glimmers than usual of his obvious distaste for what he seems to see as Mr. Gore's desperation to be president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Usually, Mr. Bush does a more thorough job of pulling his punches when he is asked what he thinks about Mr. Gore as a person.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After a reporter told Mr. Bush that Mr. Gore, whose first grandchild was born on the Fourth of July, sometimes says to Hispanic audiences that he hopes his second grandchild will be born on Cinco de Mayo, Mr. Bush muttered, ''Totally pathetic.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At another point, talking about his own desire for the presidency, Mr. Bush said: ''I'm willing to work for it. What I'm not willing to do is sell my soul to become the president.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked if Mr. Gore would do that, Mr. Bush arched an eyebrow and said, ''That's for you all to figure out.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush did not use the word ''lied,'' and when reporters did, he corrected them, coyly repeating again and again that he was simply setting the record straight and expressing his ''disappointment'' in Mr. Gore's behavior.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The vice president said I've never submitted a budget as governor of Texas'' said Mr. Bush, reciting the comments by Mr. Gore that he deemed untruthful. ''He talked about recidivism rates that were totally inaccurate numbers.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He said I called China and Russia enemies,'' Mr. Bush added. ''Have I ever referred to China and Russia as enemies?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush shook his head and veered toward what he clearly intended to be a kind of emotional and moral high ground.

  Will we roll the dice in the same casino economics that devastated our economy and hurt working families? Does anyone in this room think we should go back to the union-busting, job-destroying, budget-busting policies of the Bush-Quayle years. I don't think so. . . .

  There are deep and profound differences between Governor Bush and me. Not personal differences, but real differences on the issues.

  In both the Republican and Democratic parties, the presidential primaries this year were intense, competitive and, as a practical matter, over very quickly. Especially on the Republican side, there was a feeling that a more leisurely schedule would have given voters a better chance to think about the dramatic contrasts in style and message presented by Gov. George W. Bush and Senator John McCain. Now, a Republican Party commission led by Bill Brock, a former senator and party chairman, has put forward a plan to slow down the primary season so that it is more likely to last a full four months. This is a sound plan that ought to be adopted by the Republican National Convention this summer and copied by the Democrats, as well.

  In outlining her opposition to Mr. Bush's call for a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years, Mrs. Clinton said his plan would hurt efforts to win more federal money for New York because such broad-based tax reductions would deplete the surplus.

  ''I cannot support Governor Bush's large across-the-board tax cut,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I do not think that's right for New York or our country. The last thing we need right now before we can eliminate some of that deficit with Washington is a large across-the-board tax cut.''

  Monday was Decision Day for many high school seniors choosing colleges, but it came and went without so much as a peep from the Bush campaign about the destinations of Gov. George W. Bush's twin 18-year-old daughters, Barbara and Jenna.

  How far from home would they be straying? The Texas governor's aides were silent. What factors had the girls' final selection hinged on? Mum was the word. Aides acknowledged that the information would probably trickle out soon enough, through an unguarded utterance by Mr. Bush or an offhand comment by an official at one of the schools. But for just a bit longer, the family wanted to try to preserve the girls' privacy.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  The Bush family has been remarkably successful at that, so much so that while Mr. Bush could become the next president and while his extended family is beginning to look an awful lot like a political dynasty, his two daughters are almost invisible, their faces unknown to 99.9 percent of voters outside Texas and their public sightings only slightly more frequent than Bigfoot's.

  ''From the time he was elected governor, we've had a policy that the girls are not interviewed and not photographed,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign and a senior adviser to Mr. Bush since 1994.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Far from being out of the ordinary, the daughters' anonymity immediately recalls that of Chelsea Clinton during her father's first presidential campaign, in 1992, and is shared to a degree by the three younger Gore children. (The oldest, Karenna Gore Schiff, 26, has a public role as an adviser to her father's presidential campaign.)

  Mr. Bush has similarly benefited from news organizations' voluntary restraint. Austin is not so big a place, and there are reporters whose children -- or whose friends' children -- attend the same public high school from which Barbara and Jenna Bush will be graduating this month. But the fruits of that familiarity have not found their way onto television or into newspapers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Similarly, Mr. Bush trusts reporters on his campaign plane to be cognizant of, and to respect, his wishes that his daughters remain journalistically off-limits, and he thus talks somewhat freely about them on occasion and even mentioned, several times, the kinds of colleges each daughter was considering.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The personal-biography section of Mr. Bush's Web site digresses to mention, ''Governor and Mrs. Bush have worked hard to protect their daughters' privacy. They attend public school in Austin but do not give interviews and only appear at public events if they want to.''
 </textdata>
    <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In public, Mr. Bush walks a carefully but not always consistently drawn line. He sporadically delights audiences with a fleeting, vague riff on the agonies and ecstasies of fatherhood and repeatedly mentions that Barbara and Jenna go to a public high school. But he generally furnishes no more specifics about them than about the family's six-toed cat, Ernie.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There are exceptions to this reticence, the most conspicuous one being a chapter of his autobiography, ''A Charge to Keep'' (William Morrow &amp; Company, 1999), in which Mr. Bush discusses his support for the death penalty. He divulges that one daughter -- he does not say which -- told him over the dinner table that she disagrees with him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, have said repeatedly that they want Barbara and Jenna, fraternal twins who are the couple's only children, to be affected by their father's political celebrity as little as possible.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And they behaved as teenagers typically do, bowing to the latest pop-cultural fashions and sometimes remarking on how unfashionable their father was. In interviews with Texas journalists in the past, Mrs. Bush bemoaned that the girls's television-watching habits, at least a few years ago, included ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Melrose Place,'' and noted that they would sometimes stop their father before he walked out the door, questioning his choice of attire.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even as a governor's children, they were not constantly escorted or monitored by guards, but security around the entire family tightened earlier this year with the arrival of the Secret Service, much to the girls chagrin, an aide to Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  According to the aide and several of Mr. Bush's friends, the girls' low public profile reflects their own desires as much as their parents' efforts. For example, Barbara and Jenna Bush briefly considered accompanying their parents to the polls in Texas for the Republican primary; it was, after all, the first election cycle in which the girls were old enough to vote.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One of Mr. Bush's advisers said Barbara and Jenna Bush had learned early on that even the most seemingly harmless exposure could yield accidental humiliation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  About six years ago, when a television crew shot footage of the Bushes decorating their Christmas tree, the telephone rang and Mr. Bush joked that it might be a boy who liked Jenna. When the story was broadcast, it included both that comment and Jenna's mortified reaction.

  But the grades have also been used for more drastic measures. Florida legislators voted to give private-school vouchers to students at schools that receive F's for two years out of four. the state is appealing a court decision that ruled the vouchers, but not the grading, unconstitutional. In a speech outlining his presidential campaign pledges on education, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas proposed grading all schools and stripping some federal financing from those that received low grades for three years.

  It has become the daily tit for tat of the presidential contest. Vice President Al Gore calls Gov. George W. Bush reckless, irresponsible, profligate or arrogant. And Mr. Bush calmly replies that the vice president is like an addict when it comes to distorting the truth.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If this kind of acrid exchange seems vaguely familiar, there is good reason: During the Democratic primary campaign, Mr. Gore relentlessly attacked the proposals of former Senator Bill Bradley as risky and expensive. And Mr. Bradley calmly replied that the vice president was addicted to distorting the truth.

  Many people have their doubts. Though it may seem logical for Mr. Gore to try to bathe his less well known opponent in a negative light, the strategy carries clear risks, say independent analysts and some Democrats as well.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For one thing, Mr. Gore is now playing to an audience very different from that of the primary campaign. Back then he was talking to largely sympathetic crowds of Democrats. Now he must court swing voters who are likely to be more skeptical of his credibility and less accepting of his attacks on Mr. Bush. Taken too far, the attacks could make him appear unpleasant, overly partisan, mean-spirited and untrustworthy to the very independent and crossover voters he is courting.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even some Democrats seem to think that Mr. Gore's attacks occasionally go over the top. On Wednesday, Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of devising a ''secret'' Social Security ''privatization'' plan that would bankrupt the system. Today Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who supports investing some of the Social Security trust fund in private markets, took issue with the word ''privatization.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another danger for Mr. Gore is that voters will perceive his criticisms of Mr. Bush as personal. Mr. Gore's aides argue that his attacks are aimed solely at Mr. Bush's record and proposals. (Today alone, the vice president blasted Mr. Bush's positions on the census, managed care and gun control.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the adjectives the vice president has used in describing Mr. Bush's policies -- ''reckless,'' ''risky,'' ''irresponsible,'' ''smug,'' ''arrogant,'' ''noticeably blank'' -- also seem intended to raise questions about the governor's character, intellect and competence, many analysts say.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They note that Mr. Gore used similarly loaded words against Mr. Bradley, suggesting that he was an aloof elitist who viewed politics as ''an intellectual exercise.'' The Gore campaign seems to be trying to exploit the opposite with Mr. Bush, who, unlike Mr. Bradley, a Rhodes scholar, is viewed by his critics as lacking intellectual depth on complex issues, particularly foreign affairs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said today that he was not particularly worried that he  might be creating negative impressions among voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And he defended his recent use of the words ''smug'' and ''arrogant,'' turning away a suggestion that they had been meant to convey something about Mr. Bush's character.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''They're a commentary on the assumption that is at the heart of his campaign: that you as journalists and the American people as voters are not entitled to know the details of his private secret plan to privatize Social Security,'' Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Democratic strategists argue that Mr. Gore may have little choice but to attack so vigorously and so early in the campaign, as he did against Mr. Bradley. For one thing, he is trailing Mr. Bush, although by small margins, in most polls, including those in customarily Democratic states like Washington and West Virginia. And because he is so well known, many voters already hold relatively fixed opinions of him, as many bad as good, most polls show.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In contrast, Mr. Bush, despite his famous name, remains something of a mystery to voters outside Texas. So Mr. Gore, the reasoning goes, needs to define his rival as a risky, out-of-the-mainstream alternative. That was the very strategy that Mr. Bush's father, also a two-term vice president at the time, used with  great success 12 years ago against another governor running for president, Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If you become viewed as a risk, as Michael Dukakis was in 1988, it is a very tough road to get back from,'' said Susan Estrich, who managed Mr. Dukakis's campaign. ''If Al Gore can raise questions about Bush, Bush may never get off the ground. So Gore will just keep doing it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Ms. Estrich praised Mr. Bush's ability to roll with Mr. Gore's punches and, in the process, make him seem like a negative politician. ''It seems to be working,'' she said of the governor's approach. ''He's up.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In adopting Mr. Bradley's strategy of calling Mr. Gore dishonest, Bush aides have also appropriated one of Mr. Bradley's sharpest debate lines, which they often strip across news releases: ''Why should we believe you would tell the truth as president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush is also a candidate far different from Mr. Bradley, with a campaign quicker in its responses to the vice president's blasts. On Tuesday, for instance, Mr. Gore asserted that criminal recidivism rates in Texas had increased significantly during the Bush administration; within hours, Mr. Bush's press office had issued its own statistics rebutting the charge. Mr. Bradley's campaign sometimes let days go by before responding to attacks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And on Wednesday, after Mr. Gore's Social Security attack, Mr. Bush spent much of a flight to California giving reporters a spirited, point-by-point response to many of Mr. Gore's recent accusations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That high-altitude news conference underscored what many Republicans say are Mr. Bush's greatest  strengths as a campaigner: his sunny persona, his humor and his ability to cloak tart retorts in genial language. Those traits, Republicans say, make Mr. Gore seem all the more stiff and mean-spirited by comparison.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''By going into attack mode so early, and by repeating this mantra that everything Bush proposes is a risky scheme, Al Gore plays into George Bush's hands on the personality comparison,'' said Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster. ''George Bush comes across in that case as a likable, decent guy, and Al Gore comes across as a whining, yapping little dog.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet there is a certain logic, some analysts say, to Mr. Gore's efforts at harshly undermining Mr. Bush, and doing so sooner rather than later.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Gore didn't stop Bradley's forward momentum overnight,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. ''You have to lay the groundwork.

  ''Some Strong Words About Bush''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In recent weeks Vice President Al Gore has used a variety of derisive words, including ''risky,'' ''irresponsible,'' ''smug'' and ''reckless,'' to characterize the proposals of Gov. George W. Bush. Here is a sampling.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MARCH 16 -- ''Governor Bush's tax scheme is so risky, so reckless, that just yesterday the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, given an opportunity to vote for it, turned it down, turned the other way, said, 'We don't want to even cast a vote on that thing.' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  APRIL 30 -- ''Just this past week, Governor Bush used his brief meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov to issue a warning that his intention would be to build and deploy a global Star Wars system that he believes could defend the U.S. and all our allies against any missile launch from any source. In the 1990's, most serious analysts took a look at the implausibility of this endeavor, the fantastical price that our taxpayers would be expected to pay and the dangerously destabilizing consequences of traveling down that path and rejected this notion. Governor Bush wishes to return to it, and chose the worst possible venue in which to launch, for lack of a better phrase, his risky foreign policy scheme.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MAY 3 -- ''How does the Bush plan propose to deal with the bankruptcy of Social Security that his privatization scheme would cause? He doesn't even bother to provide an answer. He just smiles and goes on with the smug assumption that there's no need to share with you the details of what he wants to do.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Vice President Al Gore continued his intensive assault against Gov. George W. Bush's policies today, saying his Republican rival had been inordinately influenced by the National Rifle Association and had proposed an inadequate health care plan that ''offers too little for too few at the expense of too many.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But when asked later by reporters about Mr. Bush's comments that Mr. Gore's attacks were having a corrosive influence on the political process, Mr. Gore refused to respond directly, saying the nation deserved a vigorous debate on the issues.

 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore had intended to deliver a health care speech here, since he was addressing the inaugural meeting of the Association of Health Care Journalists, at Northwestern University Memorial Hospital.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But his aides said he had been captivated by reports in the morning newspapers that suggested that the gun lobby was thrilled at the prospect of a Bush presidency, and Mr. Gore rewrote his speech as he flew here this morning from Washington to draw attention to those reports.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The New York Times reported that gun manufacturers had broken off settlement talks with 31 cities and counties in hopes that a Bush administration would be more sympathetic than the Clinton administration has been. And The Washington Post reported that Kayne Robinson, first vice president of the N.R.A., had said in a speech to members in February that if Mr. Bush was elected, the gun lobby would expect to have ''a president where we work out of their office.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Handgun Control Inc., a lobbying group, began running a 30-second television commercial today that uses videotape of the speech and attacks Mr. Bush as a pawn of the National Rifle Association.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his speech, Mr. Gore said, ''Governor Bush has convinced the N.R.A. that he wants to take the gun lobbyists out of the lobby and put them right into the Oval Office.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's point was that gun violence, apart from killing people, was straining the nation's health care system, to the tune of $2.3 billion annually, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association, and that Mr. Bush was so deeply in the pocket of the gun lobby that he could not recognize this problem.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush dismissed those accusations. ''I make my positions on what I think is right,'' he said at a news conference in Orange County, Calif. ''If this is an attempt by my opponent to frighten people, I'm not going to let that happen.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked about Mr. Robinson's speech, Mr. Bush said: ''I don't want to disappoint the man, but I'll be setting up shop in the White House. It'll be my office. I'll make the decision as to what goes on in the White House.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Repeating an accusation he has made before, Mr. Bush said: ''I want to say something: I've never been a member of the N.R.A. I think Al Gore's been a member of the N.R.A., if I'm not mistaken.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This accusation momentarily befuddled both campaigns, neither of which could find evidence that Mr. Gore had belonged to the gun lobby. Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said the governor might have been referring to a Time magazine article this year that quoted an N.R.A. official as saying Mr. Gore, who represented rural Tennessee in Congress, had once been so opposed to gun control that he could have been the poster boy for it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked whether Mr. Bush had misspoken, Mr. McClellan said, ''I'll leave it at that.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said: ''The campaign has no record of Al Gore being a member of the N.R.A.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gore aides said Mr. Gore might have inadvertently become a member through a magazine subscription or some other organization.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The burden of proof is on Bush,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''He ought to be held to the same standards on distortions that you guys are holding the Gore campaign to.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush again said Mr. Gore was distorting his record and ''saying things that simply are not true.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's amazing that a person running for president of the United States would look people in the eye and say I've never submitted budgets as governor and continue to say so when I did,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At a news conference, Mr. Gore declined to respond to Mr. Bush's accusations that he was not being factual. But the vice president, who has said Mr. Bush has never put together a real budget, brought that up again. He said he happened to have in his pocket what he said was a copy of Mr. Bush's 1995 budget. He handed it to a reporter, saying, ''If you think that's a budget, then maybe I can convince you it's a duck.''

  Praise for the cardinal came from President Clinton, Gov. George E. Pataki, the Rev. Billy Graham, the presidential rivals Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, the Senate rivals Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and many others. In general they were much the same, with phrases about the cardinal's ''eloquent voice,'' and ''courage, selflessness and devotion to duty.''

  Al Gore delivered a provocative foreign policy speech Sunday that raised an important question: Does George W. Bush have the experience, the gravitas and, by implication, the brains to run U.S. foreign policy?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If not, said Mr. Gore, one can only assume that ''the gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership.''

  Al Gore delivered a provocative foreign policy speech Sunday that raised an important question: Does George W. Bush have the experience, the gravitas and, by implication, the brains to run U.S. foreign policy?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If not, said Mr. Gore, one can only assume that ''the gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now this is a legitimate question. Mr. Bush has no experience in foreign policy, the well-displayed gaps in his knowledge suggest he may not have even read the newspaper much, and this could make him easy prey for the foreign policy ideologues in his party.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in raising this question Mr. Gore, inadvertently, raises a question about himself -- a question that many people who respect him have been asking. If you talk to Al Gore about geopolitics, the Internet or the global economy, you leave feeling he really does get it. But what good are brains if you don't always act on them? Mr. Bush may not have the brains to always do the right thing, but does Mr. Gore have the spine?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Most of Mr. Gore's speech was a serious appeal for an activist, internationalist U.S. foreign policy -- something that, in fairness, Mr. Bush would also pursue. So what was legitimate in Mr. Gore's critique of Mr. Bush? It's the charge that the internationalism Mr. Bush offers often sounds like a we-will-do-whatever-we-want-because-we're-the-only-superpower-and-I-am-not-a-wimp-like-Clinton set of policies, which, if adopted at once, could be destabilizing and would have virtually no allied support. The best thing you can say is that Mr. Bush doesn't really mean some of this stuff. But what if he does?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If it were his father, the former president, you know that he would do the prudent thing. But we don't know that with George W., and when you look at his own party's willingness to be led around by the fringe views of Jesse Helms, well, Mr. Gore is right to ask: Is George W. his father's son or his advisers' captive?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But as for Mr. Gore, in his speech he called for a foreign policy of ''forward engagement'' -- addressing problems early before they become a crisis and doing so ''as close to the source of the problem as possible.'' Well, I can think of no problem more in need of such forward engagement than the U.S. embargo of Fidel Castro's Cuba, which has failed for 40 years to oust the Cuban dictator and, if continued, is only going to ensure that when Castro dies the Cuban economy collapses, civil war breaks out and thousands of Cubans sail for Miami. Fixing that policy means engaging the hard-line Miami Cubans, who want no change in policy, but as Mr. Gore showed in the Elian case, that sort of tough love is not his thing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Elian was not a one-day story. It was one of those moments when you get to see everyone's character: Attorney General Janet Reno stood her ground. Mr. Bush said what his advisers told him to say. And Mr. Gore tried to both exploit the Elian saga for political advantage and hide from it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his speech, Mr. Gore decried ''protectionism and isolationism,'' but when union-led demonstrators were disrupting the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle in the name of more protectionism, Mr. Gore was silent. What good is it to be for things in principle if you won't take them on in practice? I know Mr. Gore has cast tough votes before. I know he has to get elected. But the growing trend in the Clinton years was that the campaign never ends. This administration has not given a Sister Souljah speech to anyone in a long, long time.

  That's why the best you can say today about Governor Bush on foreign policy is that he doesn't really mean it, and won't do the wrong thing. He'll wise up. And the best you can say about Al Gore is that he really does mean it and will do the right thing. He'll stand up. But both still have something to prove.

  BUSH VOWS FIGHT IN CALIFORNIA -- On the second of what will amount to at least four swings through California this spring, Gov. George W. Bush insisted yesterday that he was determined to fight for the state's 54 electoral votes and would not repeat the actions of the last two Republican presidential nominees, who made an early show of interest in California and then effectively ceded it toward the end of the campaign. ''I intend to campaign all the way through November here,'' Mr. Bush said in Mission Viejo, where he visited a charter school. Although Mr. Bush rarely edges up to anything resembling a criticism of his father, former President George Bush, who lost his re-election bid in 1992, the Texas governor said on Wednesday that one reason Republicans had hit hard times in California was that the party's presidential nominees in 1992 and 1996 had abandoned any hope of winning the state.

  READ MY LIPS: NO SMIRK -- California was not the only place where Gov. George W. Bush discussed his father's presidential campaigns. In an ABC News interview to be broadcast today, he says his father seriously undermined his credibility by breaking the ''read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge that had helped him win the White House in 1988. The Texas governor, who himself has taken a no-new-taxes pledge, says the switch helped lead to his father's defeat by Bill Clinton. As for President Clinton, Mr. Bush sharply criticizes his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. ''He and Mrs. Clinton have done a great job with their daughter, no question about it,'' Mr. Bush says. ''But Bill Clinton, unfortunately, in the last chapter of the 20th century, embarrassed our nation.''  Mr. Bush gave Vice President Al Gore credit for being ''a loving husband and a good dad.'' But he says he is ''a little worried about a man who tends to stretch the truth in order to get ahead politically.''  And what of criticism of himself, especially the charge that he wears a habitual smirk? ''I find a great irony in life and I find humor,'' he replies. ''And I find it amazing that people would spend time analyzing whether I was smiling or not, as opposed to what my views are on education or keeping the economy strong or cutting taxes.''

  ''I'll speak out about it,'' Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said aboard his campaign plane Wednesday afternoon, referring to the vote.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked if he would phone individual Republicans who were undecided, Mr. Bush first said he doubted it, then added, ''I shouldn't say categorically no.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Several aides to Mr. Bush said the possibility of such calls had been discussed by Republican officials on Capitol Hill and some of the governor's advisers in Austin, Tex., but that nothing had been decided.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But one aide to Mr. Bush said the governor was wary of doing anything, on any issue, that resembled outright lobbying, because such actions might appear inappropriate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It could work to Mr. Bush's advantage to sway them, because it would demonstrate that his calls for more open trade with China have not fallen on deaf ears in his own party. Moreover, it would show he can exert leadership over Republicans and promote cohesiveness among them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush has almost equal reason not to push too hard. Should the measure fail, its loss would owe more to Democratic opposition than Republican and would give Mr. Bush another issue with which to beat Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who also supports it.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush could argue that the Clinton administration -- and by extension Mr. Gore -- could not win enough Congressional cooperation to pass any meaningful legislation, political analysts said.

 <textdata>
  Indeed, discussing the vote aboard his campaign jet, Mr. Bush tried to shift the topic from his plans to those of Mr. Gore. Referring to telephoning members of Congress, Mr. Bush said: ''The interesting question is, Will Vice President Gore? Because it's his administration that's trying to get the bill through.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Several House Republican aides said that Mr. Bush would probably not be asked to approach individual Republicans, because House Republicans already knew where the governor stood on the issue and would have factored that into their deliberations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Not one member has said, 'Is Governor Bush with us? I could use a call' '' one House aide said. ''But if a member says it would be really helpful to get a call from Governor Bush, we'd ask him, and we're confident he'd say yes.''

  Right after the three senators spoke, two other Democratic senators, Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota and Charles E. Schumer of New York, held their own news conference to criticize Mr. Bush's interest in including individual investment accounts as an element of overhauling Social Security.

  Mr. Gore has put paying down the $3.5 trillion national debt at the center of his economic agenda. That would reduce the federal government's interest payments. He proposes to keep Social Security solvent through 2050 by allocating the interest savings to the retirement system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is to speak next week on Social Security and include a call for putting some portion of payroll taxes into private accounts. Under this approach, part of the retirement benefit would be guaranteed and part would fluctuate with individual investment decisions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked about the commission today, Mr. Gore dismissed the idea, saying: ''These commissions are in the eye of the beholder. I disagree with them, and agree instead with the great majority of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House who are not for privatization of Social Security.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. McCain met on Sunday for about 20 minutes with Mr. Gore at the Naval Observatory in Washington, the vice president's official residence. Both were appearing on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' which was being filmed at the residence. When Mr. Gore learned on Saturday that Mr. McCain would be under his own roof on Sunday, he called the Arizona senator and invited him to come over early for a private chat.

  ''We're friends,'' Mr. Gore told reporters later, noting that the two had served in the House and Senate together. ''It's not that complicated.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said he understood that Mr. McCain, who has suspended his own presidential campaign, would be endorsing Mr. Bush, a fellow Republican, for president. But ever since Mr. Gore locked up the Democratic nomination, he has been invoking Mr. McCain's name and making an overt play for his independent-minded supporters.

  On Sunday night, Mr. Gore seemed eager to fill reporters in on the details of their get-together, uncharacteristically allowing camera crews to film him on his airplane discussing the matter as he flew from Boston to Washington.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said the two discussed campaign finance reform, Mr. McCain's signature issue and one that Mr. Gore is advancing in his campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has said the McCain-Feingold proposal to eliminate so-called soft money from campaigns would be his No. 1 domestic initiative, a move some critics suspect is an effort to inoculate himself against criticism that his own fund-raising has been too aggressive. The Sunday session thus struck some as an effort by Mr. Gore to bask in Mr. McCain's credibility on the issue, or what the political columnist Mark Shields calls ''innocence by association.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president also wanted to signal that he could work with Republicans, a theme that Mr. Bush has emphasized recently while suggesting that Mr. Gore was excessively partisan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I will regularly and routinely reach across party lines,'' Mr. Gore said on Sunday night, adding that his ''natural instincts'' were to work in a bipartisan manner.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore went even further in this direction by suggesting, in answer to a question, that he might even name a Republican as his vice president. ''I think that's unlikely,'' he said, but ''I would not rule it out.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While the cameras were still rolling, Mr. Gore also poked fun at his own comments about the Elian Gonzalez case, which has caused him much political heartache.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the biggest laugh came when Mr. Gore referred to a ''bit part'' that he had played in a well-received video that President Clinton had made to show at the annual White House correspondents' dinner on Saturday night.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A reporter on the plane remembered that Mr. Gore had made a brief appearance in the video but said, ''I've forgotten what it was,'' inadvertently summarizing Mr. Gore's longtime difficulty in establishing himself outside Mr. Clinton's shadow.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Administration officials used the news to strengthen their claim to being a force for fiscal prudence and the guardian of economic expansion. They sought to contrast their focus on debt reduction to calls from Republicans, who have a majority in Congress, and from Gov. George W.

  Maybe the only thing to do is go national. Next time Al Gore or George Bush comes to your town, ask him what he'd do to crack down on hog lagoons. One of them might have an answer, and at least it might liven things up.

  My question is, if Governor Bush has accomplished little as Texas's chief executive, how is he qualified to serve as president of the United States? Basically, he is running without any track record. Perhaps if his name weren't Bush, he would just be one of the also-rans who took part in this year's Republican primaries.

  It may shock Ms. Birch, but lots of gays oppose Mr. Gore and resent being taken for granted by the Democratic Party. Like the millions of ordinary Americans of all backgrounds, we middle-of-the-road gays are still outraged by the scandals and immorality of the present administration, and we yearn for a return to decency, honesty and virtue in the White House.

  Last week, for example, the Republican National Committee brought in $21.3 million -- the most ever raised in a single event -- at its  gala in Washington saluting the party's apparent presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. The Republicans received six-figure contributions -- and fund-raising assistance -- from Philip Morris, AT&amp;T and the National Rifle Association, all three of which are among the most generous soft-money contributors to the party this year. The Democrats hope  to raise a similar amount at a tribute to President Clinton later this month.

  The governor has used the money to raise his profile nationally. He has hired nationally known political consultants like Benjamin L.

  If there were Gore supporters in the crowd, they were not admitting it publicly. Just about everyone interviewed said they would vote for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Mr. Bush has been a strong ally of the N.R.A. in Texas, but recently he has tried to put some distance between himself and the organization, clearly aware that he needs to win the votes of some moderate Democrats and independents in November.
 </textdata>

  A GETAWAY FOR THE GORES -- Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, escaped Washington yesterday to spend their 30th wedding anniversary at Bethany Beach in Delaware. The Gores were staying at the beach home of Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's presidential campaign chairman, through Sunday. The couple took a Marine helicopter at taxpayer expense -- a requirement of the Secret Service, a spokesman said. Accompanying them were Mr. Gore's Secret Service detail, a military aide and a press aide, although the White House had not notified reporters of the vice president's travel until yesterday afternoon, after the Gores had left Washington. Mr. Gore last month had told reporters covering his presidential campaign that he would notify them when he traveled, including on his anniversary. ''I will err on the side of openness and full access as much as possible,'' he said. But he apparently had not shared this decision with his wife, who has said she hopes to maintain her family's privacy even if her husband becomes president and in a recent interview questioned why reporters would need to accompany the vice president on private trips.

  BUSH IN KENTUCKY -- Wending his way across Kentucky on a campaign bus, Gov. George W. Bush took his ''compassionate conservatism'' on the road yesterday, calling on the elderly to volunteer. At a center for the elderly in Paducah, Mr. Bush praised retired volunteers who share ''wisdom, experience and values'' as foster grandparents or mentors. He proposed to increase federal financing for such volunteer programs from $183 million a year to $240 million annually across five years. Some of the money would go to a pilot program, under which 10,000 low-income elderly volunteers would earn a $1,000 scholarship for a grandchild or a child of their choice.

  GORE WEB SITE ATTACKS BUSH PLAN -- Certain that Governor Bush has handed them the perfect campaign weapon with his Social Security proposal, the Gore campaign unveiled a new Web site this week devoted to attacking his plan. Its not-so-subtle address: www.bushinsecurity.com. The home page features a photograph of rolling dice (Mr. Gore likes to accuse Mr. Bush of promoting ''casino economics'') and a picture of a slightly crazed-looking Mr. Bush over the caption, ''When he was asked if people could lose money under his plan, Bush replied, 'Maybe, maybe not.'' Asked to respond to the Web site, Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said, ''Having invented the Internet, you would have thought Al Gore could have used it for something positive and not just another attack barrage.'' He added that he would check the site to see whether it included a link to the White House Web site that promotes the Clinton administration's proposal to invest Social Security money in the stock market, an idea Mr. Gore once supported.

  Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida is currently embroiled in a fight over an executive order that outlaws race-based admissions at the state universities -- while guaranteeing admissions to the top 20 percent of high school classes. Mr. Bush's order was meant to render moot a ballot initiative on affirmative action that Republicans feared would heighten black turnout in this year's presidential election. The 20 percent rule seemed non-controversial and even generous -- until Governor Bush found that roughly two-thirds of additional black students who might benefit from the rule had been so neglected in high school that they had failed to graduate with the necessary credits for admission to the state university system. The state is now pushing public schools that serve black students to provide better course offerings.

  Although Mr. Bush has long favored free trade, his address here today on the vast factory floor of a Boeing plant marked one of the very few times that he has tried publicly to affect pending legislation in Congress. He called next week's House vote ''among the most serious decisions our government will make this year.'' And he said ''no one serious about shouldering the responsibilities of the Presidency'' should remain silent.

  Calling trade relations with China the work of ''13 years and three administrations,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas today urged Congressional Republicans and Democrats alike to support President Clinton and vote next week to grant China permanent trade rights.

  ''From the start of this campaign I have defined some sharp differences with the Clinton-Gore administration,'' Mr. Bush said, a sleek Boeing 777 behind him. ''But today I want to address an important area of agreement. A pressing question now confronts the Congress and it will not wait until the next president takes office.''

  Mr. Bush drew some sharp distinctions between himself and Vice President Al Gore on China. But he portrayed the quest for a more open China, advanced through trade and the rule of law, as one that Presidents of both parties had fought for.

  ''This is not a Republican or Democratic concern,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It is an American concern. This trade agreement is the work of 13 years and three administrations. We cannot let that work be undone.'' He did not mention his father by name, although he was one of those Presidents. But he quoted Ronald Reagan, who called free trade ''a forward strategy for freedom.''

  With his remarks, Mr. Bush put himself in a tradition of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy that has increasingly been eroded in recent years. And the speech was just the latest example of his efforts to portray himself as leader willing to reach across party lines.

  Mr. Bush made his speech in a region of the country that has been at the epicenter of the debate over trade. While Washington is oriented toward exports, nearby Seattle was also the site of last year's violent protests against the World Trade Organization.

  The vast Boeing plant itself showcased those divisions. The company is the nation's largest exporter, but a number of its workers said they feared China's entry into the World Trade Organization would ultimately cost Americans jobs. Indeed the area's Congressman, Representative Jack Metcalf is one of the few Republicans who are undecided on the issue. Mr. Bush, on his campaign plane this afternoon, said that he had made no telephone calls to wavering house members, but would do so if Representative Tom DeLay, the majority whip, asked for his help.

  The state of Washington has voted Democratic in the last three presidential elections, but Mr. Bush's aides say they are contesting the state. The employees at the Boeing plant gave Mr. Bush a generally polite reception. He drew applause and a few boos. A long line of workers waited to meet him and shake his hand after the speech.

  Mr. Gore has supported the bill, but has been less fervent than the President, trying to avoid the wrath of organized labor, a critical Democratic constituency.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, today Mr. Bush seemed a more enthusiastic ally to Mr. Clinton on the China bill than did Mr. Gore.  Saying that ''the stakes are high,'' he argued passionately for the House to approve China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He did, however, use the occasion to draw distinctions between the Administration's approach to China and trade and his own. He said Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore view China as a ''strategic partner'' and said, ''I view China as a competitor.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also accused the administration of being inconsistent in its approach to Taiwan. And he charged that it had bungled various high- profile battles over trade. ''They failed to obtain 'fast track' trade negotiating authority,'' Mr. Bush said, ''I will fight for it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said that while China is not a ''strategic partner,'' it is not an enemy. ''When I am the President China will have no doubts about our power and purpose in the region -- about our strong commitment to democratic allies throughout Asia,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Boeing workers were divided on the issue. Before Mr. Bush spoke Jon J. Walker, 46, a tool maker, said he opposed normal trade with China because it would result in the loss of American manufacturing jobs. ''We know that labor is cheaper elsewhere,'' he said. ''We can't compete with somebody who's living in a  cardboard box.'' He said he was a Democrat who would vote for Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>

  Afterward, Charles Webb, 42, a mechanic, said that he was a unionized worker who does not ''follow the union line.'' But he said he was uncertain about China trade because ''I'm not confident with China's human rights record.'' He took a dim view of both candidates. ''I'm not going to vote for Gore -- that's a definite,'' Mr. Webb said. ''Vote for Mr. Bush? I'd prefer not to. But that may be my only choice.''

  Mr. Lindsey, who strongly favors Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus, has warned his private clients of a potential stock market tailspin that could lead to a recession. He said he sold his own stocks about two years ago so he would be able ''to sleep at night.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000

 <textdata>
  The other signal came Monday when Mr. Bush told the nation that the key to saving Social Security retirement benefits was to allow working Americans to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in the very same stock market that Mr. Lindsey, at the moment, wants no part of.

  ''What Bush is doing is taking a guaranteed system that is indexed to inflation and shifting a portion of those benefits to a non-guaranteed, non-indexed system that's based on the luck of the stock market,'' said Roger Hickey, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future, a progressive policy organization in Washington.

  Even if Mr. Bush's bet is right -- that over the next several years the stock market will do better than most other investments -- there will still be many unfortunate wage earners finding themselves at retirement time on the wrong end of this big policy stick.

  There is, however, a group of guaranteed winners under Mr. Bush's plan -- the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have been funneling many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of Mr. Bush and other politicians, just begging them to steer some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security taxes their way.

  BUSH ENDORSED AS REAGAN'S HEIR  Nancy Reagan endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for president yesterday, claiming him as an heir to the conservative political tradition of her husband, former President Ronald Reagan. ''His agenda of tax cuts, smaller government and a strong national defense will build pride in America just as it did when my husband was president,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ''This is a candidate Ronnie would be proud of.'' Mr. Reagan, 89, has Alzheimer's disease and no longer makes public appearances or statements. Mrs. Reagan has offered her endorsement of every Republican presidential candidate since her husband left office in 1988. Mr. Bush proudly embraced the Reagan mantle. ''I thank her for her endorsement and pledge an optimistic, positive campaign, in the Reagan tradition, to renew America's spirit and encourage a new era of personal responsibility and freedom,'' Mr. Bush said.

  THE VOTE IS IN THE MAIL  Unable to affect the presidential nominating contests at this late point, Oregon voters used Tuesday's vote-by-mail primary, the nation's first, to reject ballot proposals calling for a new gasoline tax and limits on damages in personal-injury lawsuits. Oregon residents have voted by mail in local elections and special statewide elections since the early 1980's, but they had never before voted entirely by mail in a regularly scheduled election. A footnote: Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Bush won going away, as expected, not that it made any difference in the nominating contests. And the turnout? The secretary of state's office put it at 47 percent, the highest since the 1992 primary, when turnout hit 49.1 percent.

  Democrats have sought to portray Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican candidate, as mired in a narrow military vision of national security no longer appropriate in a post-cold-war world.

  While respondents agreed that voters had little influence over either party's choice, they had different explanations of who made the Republican and Democratic decisions. For Mr. Bush, the public thought campaign money was most important, while for Mr. Gore, they said it was the support of party leaders. Both judgments reflected the attention those factors drew during the nomination contests.
 </textdata>

  5-18-2000

  While 21 percent said the voters had the most influence in picking Mr. Bush, 26 percent said party leaders were decisive, and 44 percent credited his success to ''people who contributed money.''

  About half of those surveyed said they were satisfied with the candidates who emerged, while half said they wanted more choices. People who said they would vote for Mr. Bush were slightly more content; 58 percent of them said they were satisfied with the choices now, compared with 52 percent of Mr. Gore's supporters.

  The dismay came through in some  follow-up interviews. Jane Marawar, a homemaker in Austin, Tex., said, ''It's important to vote, but money seems to be running the election process.'' Mrs. Marawar, a Democrat, said she did not vote in the Texas primary on March 14, a week after Mr. Gore was credited with wrapping up the nomination. By then, she said, ''the die was cast.''

  ''You shouldn't be asked to play stock market roulette with your retirement savings in the Social Security program,'' Mr. Gore told several thousand people at a convention of AARP, an organization of people 50 and older. ''You shouldn't be left without retirement security if you do. And you should not have to foot the bill for others who do play and happen to lose, because some people would lose. The Bush plan raises all of these possibilities.''

  Mr. Gore also seized on remarks by Mr. Bush on Tuesday, when the Republican governor of Texas suggested that his proposal might be just a first step toward allowing workers to invest most or all of their payroll taxes.

  Saying that Mr. Bush has not ruled out the possibility of future benefit cuts, Mr. Gore added, ''I don't think your Social Security should be up for grabs, and under my plan, it won't be.''

  Mr. Gore contends that the best way to strengthen the system is to use the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt, and then devote the interest savings to the system. The plan, he says, would not only prolong Social Security's solvency until 2054, but also keep interest rates down and sustain the economic boom.

  Mr. Bush has also tried to make the debate as much about character as about policy, arguing that Mr. Gore has shown himself to lack credibility, consistency and vision on this and other issues.
 </textdata>

  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign hammered at that theme again today, releasing material from a White House Web site in which Mr. Gore is said to have supported a proposal last year by the Clinton administration to invest some Social Security money ''to achieve higher returns.''

  ''Whether the issue is abortion, gun control, medical marijuana and now Social Security, Al Gore has a history of changing his position for political gain. That's why he has a problem with credibility.''

  Mr. Bush's aides said his comments today about the Clinton administration's position on the matter had been prompted by the United States mission's sponsoring a news conference in March by Catholics for Free Choice, a group seeking a review of the Vatican's status.

  An aide to Mr. Bush who briefed reporters at the governor's campaign headquarters here said a Bush administration would not have given Catholics for Free Choice access to the United Nations. But this aide  spoke on the condition that he not be identified. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the campaign, was less definitive, saying that if a Bush administration  sponsored such a group, Mr. Bush  ''would make clear he didn't share their point of view.''

  The controversy over Mr. Bush's campaign stop at Bob Jones, in South Carolina, was stoked by Senator John McCain, who was Mr. Bush's main rival for the Republican presidential nomination.

  In the 11 weeks since Vice President Al Gore beat former Senator Bill Bradley in the Democratic presidential race, the two men have not spoken. But there are signs that a reconciliation may lie ahead.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides to Mr. Bradley say they expect him to appear with Mr. Gore sometime before the Democratic National Convention in August, and possibly as soon as next month. And in a news conference on Thursday night, Mr. Gore acknowledged as much.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked whether he expected to appear publicly with Mr. Bradley, Mr. Gore imitated a fortuneteller, closing his eyes, pointing a finger to his temple and saying, ''I see that in the future.'' He declined to say when the appearance would take place.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And though the two men have not spoken in weeks, Mr. Gore contended that their relationship was ''in good shape.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some have doubts that those talks can overcome the bad feelings of the primaries. Disappointed with his failure to win a single state and dismayed with Mr. Gore's brass-knuckle campaign, Mr. Bradley disappeared from public view after bowing out of the race on March 9. And Mr. Gore has made little personal effort to draw him out.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his news conference on Thursday night, Mr. Gore said Mr. Bradley would definitely be given time to speak at the convention. Asked about negotiations over delegates, the vice president replied, ''I don't think there will be a problem of any kind.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides to Mr. Bradley say talks between the two camps have been reasonably smooth. But some friends of his contend that the Gore campaign should have acted sooner to unify the party and recruit his help. They say one reason Mr. Bradley has kept a low profile is that Mr. Gore has not called him personally to request his support. ''They've obviously made a calculation that they don't need Bradley's help,'' said one Democratic member of Congress who supported the Bradley campaign.

  Mr. Specter said the Gore and Freeh situations were ''as different as night and day.'' Mr. Freeh, he said, was clearly shown to have made an innocent mistake and had corrected it quickly. The questions about Mr. Gore involve whether the vice president was telling the truth when he asserted he was unaware that his fund-raising efforts were aimed at raising money that is both limited and regulated by federal law.

  As a result, the Gore campaign and the Democratic National Committee are preparing television commercials, largely biographical, for which he has been taping scenes over the last few weeks. They will highlight his experiences outside of Washington, including his time in Tennessee as a divinity student and a journalist, and his family, including the fact that he has been married 30 years and is a new grandfather.

  Today Mr. Gore spent the day at the Cordova School, a 1,120-student magnet school here outside Memphis, his sixth such visit to schools around the country since the end of the primary season in March. His main message today, as it has been during previous school visits, was to emphasize the involvement of parents in their children's lives. The level of detail into which he becomes engrossed was evident in his response to a question about the behavior of children on school buses.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-27-2000

 <textdata>
  ''One of the school bus drivers in a school in North Carolina made a suggestion that might go to your question,'' Mr. Gore said. ''He said that when children bring home their report cards on how they are doing in their course work that they ought to get a grade in bus.''

  Asked how those who attend the ceremony might distinguish Mr. Gore the vice president from Mr. Gore the presidential candidate, Major Whaley said the vice president's right to speak ''to future leaders of our nation and our Army'' cannot be taken away from him because he is aspiring to higher office.

  The question by Republicans about Mr. Gore's appearance at the military academy seemed more of a warning than concern about the past, putting Mr. Gore and his campaign on notice that, say, using the platform of a service academy commencement, either for television commercials or political remarks, would cross a line.

  BUSH BYPASSES TEXAS CONVENTION -- Gov. George W. Bush will skip the Texas Republican Party convention in Houston next month. The decision, reported in The Houston Chronicle on Friday, has prompted speculation that the decision grew out of skirmishes with conservative elements of the party, but Bush campaign aides insisted otherwise. ''The governor will be campaigning in Florida and Kentucky at that time,'' said Ray Sullivan, a campaign spokesman in Austin. ''But Laura Bush is planning to address the convention as his representative.'' Mr. Sullivan denied that there were any lingering problems with anti-abortion elements of the party that, during the 1996 Texas convention, stripped Mr. Bush of a governor's traditional role as leader of the state delegation to the national convention.

  NEIGHBORLY ADVICE -- Crawford High School in Crawford, Texas, had never had a commencement speaker until Gov. George W. Bush volunteered, choosing the Friday night event to say hello to his new neighbors. The Texas governor last year bought a ranch -- expected to be a sort of Western White House if he is elected -- about 7 miles west of Crawford, 115 miles southwest of Dallas. In his talk, Mr. Bush gave the 45 graduates some advice, including, ''I've learned that no matter how old you are or how important your job is you can never escape your mother.''

  One came in the Carter administration, setting aside more than five million acres as wilderness, and another in the Bush administration, when Congress agreed to phase out much of a subsidy that was allowing two major timber companies to pay as little as $2 for huge Sitka spruce logs that would fetch about $300 on the open market. The subsidy dated to the 1950's, when the United States Forest Service agreed to provide a steady supply of timber at low prices to two companies that agreed to build pulp mills in the area.

  A BOSNIAN BY ANY OTHER NAME -- Although aides to Gov. George W. Bush have dismissed as unimportant the several times he has mangled the proper terms for people of various nationalities, they were elated by a report yesterday that his adversary, Vice President Al Gore, had committed a similar error. Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, gleefully broadcast the bulletin that Mr. Gore had referred to Bosnians as Bosniaks. ''It can happen to the best of us,'' Ms. Hughes said, ''as I hope the vice president will concede.'' Yes, but. As it turns out, Bosniak is an apparently acceptable alternative, listed in some dictionaries, so Mr. Gore spoke correctly. And Ms. Hughes got no more mileage out of the incident than she had with a disapproving recitation on Tuesday night of Jewish jokes that the vice president had publicly told. Where was the outrage? Not among the Bush press corps, whose members were too busy laughing to be on political-correctness patrol.

  BUSH AHEAD IN NEW POLL -- The latest national presidential preference poll shows Mr. Bush taking a substantial eight-point lead over Mr. Gore, 51 percent to 43 percent. The poll, published yesterday in The Los Angeles Times, surveyed 1,211 registered voters, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. It was conducted from May 4 to 7, just about the same time that a poll done for the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found Mr. Bush barely edging Mr. Gore, 46 percent to 45 percent. That poll, conducted May 2 to 6 and covering 940 registered voters, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Meanwhile, in polls conducted last week in six of the largest and most politically important states by the American Research Group of Manchester, N.H., Mr. Bush leads Mr. Gore by 7 percentage points in Florida, 47 points in Texas and 3 points in Pennsylvania, whereas Mr. Gore leads by 14 points in California and 20 in New York. In Illinois, there is a tie. Over all, according to the latest available state polls, Mr. Bush is ahead in 17 states (good for 183 of the required 270 electoral votes), and Mr. Gore leads in 10 states (good for 146 electoral votes).

  A MESSAGE FROM WOMEN -- Mr. Gore, who polls indicate is having difficulty maintaining the traditional Democratic advantage with women, has been put on notice by two dozen women's organizations that he needs to work harder to win women's political allegiance. In an hourlong session on Tuesday in the Old Executive Office Building with about 40 leaders of the women's groups, the vice president was told he needed a better media strategy to convey his positions on issues like Social Security, paycheck fairness, domestic violence and abortion. ''The message isn't getting out to women,'' Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National Organization for Women, said in an interview after the meeting. Nancy Zirkin, a spokeswoman for the American Association of University Women, said the meeting was requested four months ago, on a nonpartisan basis, so the women could hold a general discussion with Mr. Gore about their concerns. She said the request was not prompted by the vice president's lag in the polls or by growing polling evidence that the Democratic candidate's edge with women was beginning to erode. Mr. Gore, who was accompanied at the meeting by Donna Brazile, his campaign manager; Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, and Alexis M. Herman, the secretary of labor, agreed to additional meetings. Ms. Brazile suggested after the meeting that the women's groups could help him get out his message. ''But we're not in any trouble with women voters,'' she insisted.

  Under Mr. Bush's plan, which anticipates the fast-growing number of older Americans, people of any age who buy insurance for the kind of extended nursing-home stays not covered by other policies or by Medicare could fully deduct the annual premium from their taxes, whether they itemize deductions or not.

  ''To many of our seniors, illness can be a path to financial ruin, and this is one of the greatest fears of retirement and our nation must address it as we head into the 21st century,'' Mr. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, told about 80 people at a nursing home here.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The scope and expense of Mr. Bush's proposal was modest -- it would cost $7.4 billion over five years -- and some critics said it would make only the smallest of dents in a problem that is becoming ever more severe. But the plan represents an effort to demonstrate that Mr. Bush is paying heed to health care and to elderly people, an issue and a voting bloc that could be decisive in the presidential election this fall.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush seemed to take the dynamics of the electorate into full account with remarks that aimed for a kind of political trifecta, singling out and offering reassurances not only to the elderly but also to baby boomers and to women. His message to baby boomers was that their anticipatory qualms about retirement were foremost in his mind, while his nod to women was his recognition that they typically shoulder most of the responsibility for older relatives.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the elderly were arguably his most important audience, because Vice President Al Gore has asserted that he has more thoughtful and responsible ideas for both health care and Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was clearly trying to challenge that claim. He intends to follow today's proposals with a speech on Monday outlining his philosophy on changing Social Security and Medicare and dealing with the high cost of prescription drugs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The high stakes of the presidential candidates' jostling over these issues was suggested by the fact the Gore campaign arranged for reporters to talk on the phone today with the secretary of health and human services, Donna E. Shalala.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dr. Shalala did not seem to be fully aware about what, exactly, Mr. Bush was recommending, but she said the plausibility of all of his proposals was thrown into doubt by his call for a tax cut of $483 billion over five years, which is much larger than the tax cut Mr. Gore favors.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dr. Shalala also said that Mr. Bush's financial incentives to buy long-term care insurance did nothing to address the flaws of many of the policies on the market and that the exemption that Mr. Bush would grant home caregivers was nowhere near as generous as the $3,000 tax credit that the Clinton administration had proposed and that Mr. Gore supports. The exemption, for someone in a 15 percent tax bracket would amount to only a few hundred dollars a year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Long-term care insurance, which fills a gap in what is provided by private and corporate health care policies and Medicare, covers the cost of an extended stay in a nursing home or assisted-living center for people whose financial resources have not dwindled to the point where they qualify for Medicaid. Figures provided by the Bush campaign indicated, only about 5 percent of Americans had such policies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  An aide to Mr. Bush said that a 39-year-old person would pay an annual premium of about $358 for a policy that guaranteed two years of nursing home care, and $507 for a policy that guaranteed five years; a 64-year-old would pay about $1,265 for the two-year guarantee and $1,709 for the five-year one. The older the person buying the policy, the more it costs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  More than 40 percent of Americans over the age of 65 have annual incomes of under $20,000. Joshua M. Wiener, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute in Washington, noted that these people would be unable to afford such a policy even after Mr. Bush's deduction, which would shave only a few hundred dollars off the price.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is basically for the upper-middle-class elderly,'' Mr. Wiener said of Mr. Bush's proposal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush plan also sets no income ceiling for eligibility, so that wealthy Americans in higher tax brackets would save more on the policies than middle-class Americans, because the tax deduction would be more valuable for them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But an aide to Mr. Bush said the plan was not intended primarily for these people, many of whom have jobs that already offer long-term care benefits and thus would not qualify for the deduction.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Bush, citing figures on the looming rise in the number of Americans over 65, said it was important to put mechanisms into place to encourage their financial security and to decrease the number who will end up needing public money and help.

  Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has said he will support an extension of the moratorium.

  Social Security has emerged as a critical issue in this year's presidential campaign, but neither candidate seems prepared to address the system's long-term financial problems. Instead, Gov. George W. Bush wants to let individuals invest a small part of their Social Security contributions in the stock market, where he thinks they will earn a better return, and Vice President Al Gore proposes to keep the system largely intact with an infusion of general tax revenues. Neither proposal would really stabilize the system in the long run. In truth, though Social Security is projected to become bankrupt in four decades, the system is not all that far out of kilter. It would not be hard for bold politicians to devise a fix.

  Social Security may well be, as Governor Bush has said, ''the single most successful government program in American history.'' It was created in 1935, during the depths of the depression, to provide a guaranteed income to retired workers for as long as they live. Unlike private pension plans, Social Security benefits keep pace with inflation and, unlike 401(k)'s and other popular private plans, Social Security benefits do not fluctuate with stock and bond markets. Social Security provides the majority of income for most retirees and all the income for about a fifth of the elderly.

  One proposed remedy for financial imbalance is partial privatization, the approach favored  by Governor Bush. Under current law, workers  and employers pay a 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes into a public trust fund. Under partial privatization, workers could divert, say, two percentage points of that tax to private accounts that the worker could then invest in stocks and bonds. Workers would collect less money from the trust fund when they retired, alleviating financial strain on  the system. But they would expect to more than make up for the loss by drawing from their private accounts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's sketchy proposal fails to answer where he would find the money to pay retirees as payroll taxes were diverted into private accounts. But there are other fundamental problems with the proposal as well.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush cites as an advantage that private accounts can be invested in stocks whereas the trust fund by law cannot. But if the law were changed to let the trust fund itself purchase stocks, as President Clinton has proposed, it could invest in the markets far more cheaply than could private accounts. The cost of administering 150 million individual private accounts would be huge, eating away 20 percent or more of worker deposits. Private accounts could also subject individuals, including the poor, to unacceptable investment risk at the most vulnerable time in their lives. Worse, they undermine the principle of social insurance, setting individuals off to fend for themselves without looking out for the needy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Vice President Al Gore proposes to leave the basic system unchanged and would use general revenues to extend the life of the trust fund to about 2050. He ducks proposing tax hikes or benefit cuts that would be needed to solve the system's problems after that date. Indeed, he does the opposite by proposing new benefits for stay-at-home mothers and for widows and widowers, thereby increasing the financial strain on the system.

  These two ideas, remembrance and reconciliation, will surely survive in the century ahead. But there may be subtle changes in the spirit if not the essential purposes of the holiday, just as there have been changes in the demography of the marchers. It has been many years since old men in threadbare gray and blue uniforms paraded down the nation's main streets. It has been 20 years at least since we saw more than a few veterans of World War I. Now the cohort that fought World War II is diminishing. George Bush, senior, is almost certainly that celebrated generation's last president.

  These two ideas, remembrance and reconciliation, will surely survive in the century ahead.

  Our cultural memory is also receding, especially the recollection of what it was like to have an entire country mobilized, body and soul, to fight an enemy. The First and Second World Wars were, to most Americans, unambiguously noble, and so in its goals of eliminating slavery and saving the union was the Civil War. But since then our conflicts have become less clear-cut -- most famously Vietnam, but also to some extent Korea and even Mr. Bush's Desert Storm.

  Mr. Cohen extended the invitation after Mr. Bush proposed last week to consider making unilateral reductions in nuclear weapons, possibly deeper than those now being negotiated between the United States and Russia. Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also pledged to construct a far larger antiballistic missile defense than the one now contemplated by the Clinton administration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cohen, appearing today on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' said Mr. Bush's proposals contained ''internal inconsistencies.'' Building a larger missile defense than the administration's limited one, Mr. Cohen added, would force the Russians and other nations, like China, to increase their own offensive nuclear arsenals, making negotiated reductions far less likely.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cohen's objections echoed those Mr. Gore made during his commencement address at the United States Military Academy on Saturday, when he said Mr. Bush's proposals were harmful to arms control and threatening to global stability.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said he would invite Mr. Bush to meet with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Adm. Richard W. Mies, commander of the American nuclear arsenal, as a matter of fairness in the presidential campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  ''I think that he and then Vice President Gore will be in a better position to debate this in a way that's responsible and, I think, informed,'' he said.

  Mindy Tucker, the Bush campaign's press secretary, said in response to Mr. Cohen's proposal, referring to two key Bush advisers:
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Surely Secretary Cohen is not suggesting that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and General Colin Powell, who led our defenses, don't understand them. And we are confident that the Joint Chiefs of Staff would welcome Governor Bush's proposal because it allows military planners to determine the appropriate levels of security based on new guidance and a new security era.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We would hope that Al Gore would call on his administration not to play politics with these briefings or the Joint Chiefs of Staff,'' Ms. Tucker said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Pentagon officials said the invitation to Mr. Bush was Mr. Cohen's idea. While it is common for a president-elect to receive high-level national security briefings as part of the transition to the White House, it is unusual to extend such an early invitation to a presidential candidate from the party out of power, especially one who has not yet received his party's formal nomination.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In light of Mr. Cohen's criticism, the invitation could be seen as a suggestion that Mr. Bush's ideas are ill-formed. At the same time, having Mr. Bush discuss nuclear strategy with senior commanders could lend weight to the governor's handling of military issues in the campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Pentagon officials said they had not yet made arrangements for a briefing. One potentially knotty problem could be the degree of secrecy concerning nuclear weapons. Since Mr. Bush does not have a security clearance, his briefing might be limited to unclassified information.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his proposal last week, Mr. Bush did not say he would reduce the number of nuclear weapons automatically. Instead, he said he would consider reductions based on recommendations by the Pentagon's military commanders. Last Tuesday, even as Mr. Bush made his proposals, those commanders appeared on Capitol Hill and said they would oppose reducing the number of warheads below the 2,000 to 2,500 being negotiated under the third strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start 3.

  Taking one of the biggest political risks of the presidential campaign so far, Mr. Bush proposed allowing individual workers to invest a part of their payroll taxes through private accounts. His plan would give workers an opportunity to capture some of the riches that Wall Street creates, but would also leave those workers to suffer the financial consequences if their timing or judgment is off.

  Mr. Gore wants to maintain the guaranteed nature of the Social Security benefit, allowing it to remain a bulwark against poverty in old age. But through a somewhat complicated mechanism, Mr. Gore is calling for the bill to be paid in part over the long run out of general tax revenues -- in effect, heaving the problem onto the shoulders of taxpayers three decades from now.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Like most Democrats, Mr. Gore is comfortable with government as a guarantor and sees Social Security as a collective commitment that binds the generations. Like most Republicans, Mr. Bush is dedicated to giving more power and responsibility to individuals.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In elevating the call for private accounts to the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush is asking for a mandate to break the deadlock. Although Mr. Gore's approach would eventually require a fundamental change in  the nature of the system as well, the vice president has cast himself as the defender of a program that has proved to be perhaps the most popular and most effective of any administered in Washington.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is already clear that the clash between the two candidates will be supercharged, with Mr. Gore in particular unleashing a sustained attack on Mr. Bush's position. And the more heated the clash, the greater the risk that the debate will so polarize voters and unnerve politicians that it blocks progress for years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many Democrats and some Republicans wonder why Mr. Bush has chosen to wade into such a polarizing issue. ''Politically it's not'' a great idea, said Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire who is one of the most prominent advocates of adding private accounts to Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The Bush campaign is betting that young people will end up voting on this issue,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ''But recent history is pretty clear that the people who vote on Social Security tend to be in their 50's and older, and their vote is based on making sure that the system that's protecting their parents is there to protect them.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Bush is trying to turn attention to the trade-off at the core of Mr. Gore's plan, which is built around eliminating the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public and capturing the interest savings for Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The Gore plan will eventually require a 25 percent increase in income taxes -- the largest in our history -- or a substantial reduction in benefits,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore is trying to keep the debate focused on the risks inherent  in investing Social Security money in the financial markets -- and is emphasizing that Mr. Bush's plan would leave less money to pay down the debt. The Bush plan ''would weaken our national economy,'' Mr. Gore said, and create the risk of millions of retirees ''left without enough to make ends meet.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said one thing today that Mr. Bush would no doubt agree with.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There is a fundamental difference on this issue in this election,'' Mr. Gore said, ''which offers the country the most critical choice on Social Security since it was first enacted in 1935.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Social Security faces a financial shortfall as the baby boom generation ages. Based on current estimates, the retirement system would spend its reserves by 2037, leaving it able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits after that point. To deal with that problem, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are proposing different solutions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Starting in 2011, Mr. Gore would begin transferring to Social Security an amount equal to the interest saved through reduction of the public debt. The amount would start at around $100 billion a year, and would grow to more than $200 billion a year by 2015. By doing so, Mr. Gore's plan would extend Social Security's solvency to 2050 without any cuts in benefits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The money Mr. Gore would transfer into Social Security would not be cash, but instead i.o.u.'s that would have to be paid out of general tax revenues. In that way, Mr. Gore's plan would obligate taxpayers decades in the future to pay to keep the system afloat out of general revenues from income taxes -- a change from the current system under which Social Security is financed out of payroll taxes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's approach is built around the idea that the only alternative to cutting benefits or raising taxes is to increase the rate of return on the money going into the Social Security system. The best way to accomplish that goal, in his view, is to allow all workers to invest part of their payroll taxes in private accounts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has provided few details, saying that the specifics would have to be worked out in bipartisan negotiations. There are a variety of approaches to establishing individual investment accounts, and most would use about 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes to pay Social Security benefits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Any investment plan that used 2 percentage points of the payroll tax would use about $1 trillion of the Social Security surplus over the next decade. That money would otherwise go to debt reduction, so Mr. Bush's plan would leave the nation with a larger debt than Mr. Gore's plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Historically, investing in the stock market has yielded a high rate of return, better than 7 percent from 1926 through 1997, according to the Bush campaign. But there have been long periods when the market has been down, and not every investor has chosen the right stocks. Investing in safer alternatives, like bonds, reduces the rate of return along with the risk. And Democrats point out that most workers are already subject to considerable risk through 401(k)'s and other retirement accounts.

  Although Social Security has long been considered the ''third rail'' of politics that a candidate touches at his peril, Mr. Bush took a gamble that in the new economy, with nearly 50 percent of American households now owning stock, his proposal would prove appealing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and me,'' Mr. Bush said in an appearance at a center for the elderly here. ''He trusts the government to manage our retirement. I trust individual Americans.'' [Excerpts, Page A18.]
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000

  Mr. Bush also embraced a bipartisan proposal for Medicare that would reshape it by giving beneficiaries fixed amounts of money to choose from various health plans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A few hours later outside Philadelphia, Mr. Gore came out squarely against the plan, calling it dangerous for individual taxpayers and for the economy overall. ''If we turn the Social Security system into a system of winners and losers,'' he said, ''we will be jeopardizing retirement security for too many Americans, and in the end we will all have to pay to make up the differences.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Shifting some of the payroll tax into individual retirement accounts would amount to the most far-reaching change in Social Security since its inception in the Depression. As Social Security has worked for decades, current retirees are paid from the payroll taxes of current workers; under the Bush plan, workers would be able to use a portion of their payroll taxes and invest them for their own retirement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush argued that it would both provide an infusion of cash to make the system solvent and give people ''the security of ownership.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But he largely skirted specifics, preferring to talk about broad principles. It was unclear, for instance, exactly how much money people could set aside for individual accounts and what sort of investment options they would have. Mr. Bush did say the investments would have to be in ''steady, reliable funds,'' adding that ''there will be no fly-by-night speculators or day trading.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I am here with a message for America and to put my opponent on notice,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The days of spreading fear and panic are over. The days of delaying, dividing, demagoguing are over. When I am elected, this generation and this president will solve Social Security.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said that President Clinton and Mr. Gore had squandered eight years when they could have addressed the problems posed by the baby boomers. ''At a time for leadership, for long-term thinking, my opponent proposes a Band-Aid approach,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He says and I quote, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' But in the lifetime of some people in this room, it will be broke and we must fix it. With every day of delay this becomes more difficult.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has in large part staked his candidacy on the health of the economy and made paying down the debt the centerpiece of his economic plan. He has proposed extending the life of Social Security until 2054 by devoting the interest saved in paying down the debt to the retirement system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore, in his own appearance, asked what would happen to investments if economic prosperity abated. ''Today, when Wall Street is booming, I know that plan sounds appealing,'' he said. ''It probably sounds like an easy way to make more money and have more control over your retirement. But in reality, the Bush privatization plan would weaken our economy and undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum basic retirement.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked later about his lack of detail, Mr. Bush called his speech ''pretty darned detailed to be talking about a framework to get something done.'' His aides said he had avoided specifics because Hillary Rodham Clinton's abortive effort to craft a plan for universal health coverage had shown that being locked into one plan was a recipe for legislative disaster on a complicated issue.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the lack of specifics on matters like what percentage of payroll tax would go to accounts and what age group would see the change opened Mr. Bush to charges that he was masking some of the hard choices ahead and trying to sidestep questions about how he could afford the transition as well as his sweeping call for a $1.3 trillion tax cut in the next decade.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Supporters of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore feuded all day over which plan was more risky and which would entail more of a shift of general tax revenue into Social Security. Such a shift would require cuts in other programs or could lead to tax increases.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president asserted that Mr. Bush's plan would make it nearly impossible to pay down the national debt. ''By leaving us with a multitrillion dollar debt for as far as the eye can see, the Bush plan could trigger higher interest rates and slower long-term growth,'' Mr. Gore said. ''That undermines our chance to meet other challenges, such as keeping Medicare solvent or providing an affordable prescription drug benefit for seniors.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has been lagging in recent polls and his advisers said privately they were pleased that Mr. Bush had taken on Social Security because it set up a clear policy difference between the candidates and provided a big target to shoot at, much like former Senator Bill Bradley's universal health care plan in the Democratic primaries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, Mr. Gore intends to talk about Social Security two more times this week, before younger voters at Fordham University in New York on Tuesday and before older voters in Florida on Wednesday.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's advisers, however, believe that the politics of Social Security is changing and that their plan will appeal to younger voters who are comfortable with the market and doubt that the government will provide a secure retirement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today, Mr. Bush also expressed support for an approach to Medicare that had been drafted by a bipartisan commission, which would have converted Medicare into an arena for public and private competition. The approach would have given each beneficiary a fixed amount of cash to use when choosing from public and private health care plans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said the elderly should be given a choice of health plans to buy, including one providing prescription drug coverage. He said Medicare itself should provide full drug coverage for the most low-income elderly.

  At a time for leadership, for long-term thinking, my opponent proposes a Band-Aid approach. He says, ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' But in the lifetime of some people in this room, it will be broke, and we must fix it. With every day of delay this becomes more difficult. For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has failed to act. And now Al Gore wants to pass the burden on to future generations. The Gore plan will eventually require either a 25 percent increase in income taxes, the largest in our history, or a substantial reduction in benefits. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000

 <textdata>
  George W. Bush outlined his approach in a speech this morning. We still don't know all the details of his plan, but we do know that he is proposing to partially privatize Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in reality, the Bush Social Security privatization plan would weaken our national economy and undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum decent retirement. It would weaken our economy because it would make it impossible to pay down our national debt. It would cost about $1 trillion over 10 years to meet today's obligations through Social Security while allowing people to set up these individual accounts. And at the same time, Governor Bush is proposing a huge tax cut of nearly $2 trillion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The numbers just don't add up, and under the Bush plan, a serious reduction of our national debt is simply impossible. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush Social Security privatization plan also threatens the Social Security guarantee for future generations of retirees. That guarantee is the whole purpose of Social Security. Yet under the Bush plan, you could lose some or all of the money you invest, and millions could be left without enough to make ends meet.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today, in The Dallas Morning News, Governor Bush was asked whether his plan would guarantee that future beneficiaries would receive no less than they would have under today's system. His answer, ''Maybe, maybe not.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In other words, Governor Bush admits that his plan takes the ''security'' out of Social Security. Well, I believe you deserve a guarantee, not a ''maybe.''

  Despite Mr. Bush's advantages six months before Election Day, Mr. Gore may be heartened that vice presidents are often overshadowed by the presidents they serve until they can distinguish themselves on a national stage at their nominating convention. In fact, at this time 12 years ago, Mr. Bush's father, then the vice president, trailed Michael S. Dukakis by 10 points, but went on to a lopsided victory in November.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Voters also seemed skeptical of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut of $483 billion over five years -- a measure that Mr. Gore has condemned as a ''risky tax scheme.'' Even 57 percent of people who said they planned to vote for Mr. Bush were uncertain of the effect of that proposal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush will also have to cautiously navigate roiling factions in his own ranks. Three of every 10 Republican voters polled said that if the governor picks a running mate who supports legalized abortion they would be less likely to support him. About a third of all voters said religious conservatives carry too much influence in the Republican Party.

  Perhaps the most promising news for Mr. Gore was that he scored well with voters on issues they said were at the top of their agenda, like health care, education and Social Security. He was also seen as more caring than Mr. Bush, despite the governor's slogan that he is a ''compassionate conservative.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Given that his issues are popular and that the economy seems hearty, the nagging difficulty that has confounded the vice president's advisers and many Democrats is why his overall ratings are not more competitive with Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Among all voters, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by 8 percentage points, 47 to 39. Mr. Bush held a wide advantage among men, 50 to 36 percentage points; among women, Mr. Gore drew 42 percent, Mr. Bush, 44 percent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president's lagging ratings appear to have more to do with personality than policy. Mr. Gore was seen favorably by 34 percent of registered voters and unfavorably by 36 percent. By contrast, Mr. Bush was seen favorably by 40 percent and unfavorably by 28 percent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A related problem that has dogged Mr. Gore is that Mr. Bush is viewed as more of a leader. Fifty-three percent of registered voters in the new poll said Mr. Gore had strong leadership qualities; 63 percent said the same thing about Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The contrast is striking, particularly since Mr. Gore has been an elected official since 1976, when he was elected to the House from Tennessee; Mr. Bush was elected governor, his first office, in 1994. That said, Mr. Gore has spent the past seven years in the shadow of a president who consistently draws high ratings for the job he has done in office.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''Gore has not really shown a lot of leadership qualities or abilities to be in a position to run our nation,'' said Ken Bogler, 27, a labor representative from Somerset, N.J., who is an independent. ''It's a presence, really. The way he carries himself, the way he speaks, does not seem presidential.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Vera Jeane, 71, a retired nurse from Bay City, Tex., who is a Democrat, put it this way: ''Al Gore acts as if he's not sure what he's thinking, as if he doesn't have a mind of his own. He doesn't seem to be strong enough in his opinions and as a leader to be president. Bush seems to be a stronger man with more definitive opinions. And I think he would make a better leader.''
 </textdata>

  Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said he was not discouraged by such critiques and insisted that voters would defect from Mr. Bush when his policy stands are articulated in detail.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Citing how Mr. Gore has inched up in the polls since last year, Mr. Coelho added: ''We've made up a lot of points with George Bush. I'm not worried about George Bush at this point.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, in particular, has made little headway in trumpeting his programs for cutting taxes and overhauling the Social Security system. Only 9 percent of registered voters in the poll said they knew a great deal about Mr. Bush's tax blueprint; 58 percent said they had no idea whether his plan would help or hurt the economy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000

  In a finding that raises questions about the Social Security proposal Mr. Bush discussed yesterday, those polled were closely divided over whether individuals should be allowed to invest portions of their Social Security taxes on their own.

  When asked to put aside their presidential preferences and focus on issues, Mr. Gore was considered more capable in tackling Social Security and education, traditional Democratic strengths.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Voters also identified stark ideological differences between the candidates. For all the efforts by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to court moderates, voters did not see them as moderates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Forty-three percent of registered voters said they thought of Mr. Bush as a conservative while 34 percent said they thought he was a moderate. Similarly, 43 percent cast Mr. Gore as a liberal, while 30 percent said he was more a moderate.

  Mr. Bush has been unable to shake the idea advanced by gun control advocates that the National Rifle Association would wield considerable influence in a Bush administration. Voters were three times more likely to say that Mr. Bush would be influenced greatly by the N.R.A. than Mr. Gore would.

  In the follow-up interviews, some voters, citing character considerations, lamented that Senator John McCain, who was defeated by Mr. Bush in the Republican primaries, would not be on any ticket. In fact, Mr. McCain has maintained far more impressive favorability ratings than Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore: 46 percent have a favorable view of him; 14 percent hold an unfavorable view.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000

  ''I don't see in Gore or Bush that clear definitive leadership quality that McCain had,'' said Tim Olkar, 22, a student in Wheaton, Ill., who is an independent.

  AL GORE, THE CARTOON -- Vice President Al Gore's aides may have finally found a way to overcome complaints about his being too stiff: animation. In the May 21 season finale of the Fox sci-fi comedy, ''Futurama,'' the real Mr. Gore provides the voice for a cartoon Al Gore in an episode titled, ''Back to the Present.'' In the show, the cartoon Mr. Gore leads a team of ''Action Rangers'' who help the bumbling Futurama regular, Fry, return to the 31st Century after he gets stranded in the 21st.

  AL GORE, THE FATHER AND SON -- After wrapping up a campaign speech yesterday afternoon near Philadelphia, Vice President Al Gore flew on a half-empty Air Force II to Nashville, to pick up his mother, Pauline. The two were scheduled to fly to New York City today to see Mr. Gore's daughter, Karenna, graduate from Columbia Law School. Mr. Gore's aides said the flight to Nashville was paid for by taxpayers instead of by his campaign because it involved family business.

  *Except for Jimmy Carter, every president for the last quarter-century has been left-handed. There is no question about Gerald R. Ford, George Bush or Bill Clinton. Ronald Reagan writes and eats with his right hand. But Edmund Morris, the Reagan biographer, has little doubt that Mr. Reagan is a natural lefty who is one of those who were trained to use their right hands. In the movies, Mr. Morris says, Mr. Reagan always twirled and shot pistols with his left hand, and as president, he always waved with his left hand. The presidential string is about to be broken. Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are both right-handed.

  Still, he's getting the brush. In the latest New York Times poll, George W. Bush has a wide lead with men and, amazingly, edges out Mr. Gore with women (who elected Bill Clinton), 44 to 42 percent. Even feminists are nagging Mr. Gore about his lack of oomph.

  ''Nuclear unilateralism will hinder, rather than help, arms control,'' Mr. Gore said, before handing out diplomas to the 944 graduates who trooped across the stage in their dress uniforms and white gloves.

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Without mentioning Mr. Bush by name, Mr. Gore issued the most detailed rebuttal yet of the foreign policy address that Mr. Bush delivered in Washington on Tuesday. Again and again, Mr. Gore assailed the notion of one-sided arms reductions, a prospect that Mr. Bush had raised at an appearance with a cast of well-known Republican foreign policy leaders.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore emphasized that reductions should be pursued within negotiations and the framework of existing arms control treaties.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president said that the Clinton administration was already negotiating for bilateral cuts in nuclear arms and was considering a limited missile defense, but said the kind of approach recommended by Mr. Bush was misguided.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Reductions alone do not guarantee stability,'' Mr. Gore said. ''It is how reductions are made and how they interact with defensive systems that makes the difference.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's remarks were unmistakably pointed in criticism of the Bush speech, which called for a reduction -- possibly unilateral -- in American nuclear weapons combined with an expanded missile defense system.

  Mr. Gore was invited to the academy in his capacity as vice president, and the speech was billed as an official vice presidential event, not a campaign appearance. As such, he told reporters on Friday night, his remarks on the academy grounds would not be ''political'' in nature. ''I will not make a partisan remark,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But his comments today were Mr. Gore's first in public since Mr. Bush made his proposal on Tuesday, and they were being written by the vice president and his longtime national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, as the vice presidential entourage flew to the Hudson Valley on Friday night aboard Air Force Two from a campaign appearance in Memphis.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Fuerth told reporters that the vice president's comments were based on his long-standing principles and the fact that President Clinton was going to Russia next week, and that they were not intended as a response to Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In Mr. Gore's discussion with reporters on Friday night on Air Force Two, he sharply criticized Mr. Bush's proposal. He said it would re-ignite the arms race, and by saying so, he seemed to ensure that his differences with Mr. Bush would be part of the news media's coverage today.
 </textdata>

  Today, at the graduation exercise, Mr. Gore outlined the Clinton administration's efforts toward creating a national missile defense system that would protect all 50 states from a limited attack.

 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We believe, however, that it is essential to do this in a way that does not destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The A.B.M. Treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability in our relationship with Russia.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What Mr. Bush proposed would almost surely entail violating the A.B.M. Treaty of 1972.

  Mr. Bush said he wanted to reduce the size of the United States' nuclear arsenal to the ''lowest possible number consistent with our national security'' and below the levels called for under the Start II accord with Russia.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also noted in his speech to the cadets that President Clinton was headed for Moscow next week. ''This is an historic meeting,'' he said. ''The president should leave with the full support of the American people,'' a subtle reminder to Republicans that partisan differences over national security traditionally stop at the water's edge when the president travels abroad.

  Mr. Bush's speech on military preparedness, delivered in Washington as he was flanked by foreign policy experts from four Republican administrations, earned the governor widespread news media coverage on a topic on which the Gore campaign has hoped Mr. Bush would appear inexperienced and politically vulnerable.

  The Vietnam-fighting experience of the husky, 55-year-old Pennsylvania governor comes in handy these days. He is being targeted by the social conservative right for being a Roman Catholic who unapologetically favors a woman's right to choose abortion, yet remains prominently featured on a list of potential running mates of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the putative Republican presidential nominee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But social and religious conservatives see things differently, and have issued stern warnings to Mr. Bush of dire consequences in November if he picks someone like Mr. Ridge.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Ridge, his abortion rights stand firmly defying party platform dogma, remains the most mentioned prospective running mate. He set a Republican record for this heavily Democratic state with a 780,000-vote victory margin in his 1998 re-election. A Bush-Ridge ticket might well deliver this critical battleground, the fifth-largest state in electoral votes, to the Republicans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In two elections, Mr. Ridge has shown considerable crossover attraction among Democratic voters. He has the power to garner up to 30 percent of them, according to polls -- a factor that Mr. Bush must weigh as he charts a centrist strategy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Other Republicans also note that Mr. Bush had to be more sensitive to the nation's large Catholic vote after his controversial speech in the South Carolina primary at Bob Jones University, a campus that critics denounce as anti-Catholic.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''All this wonderful speculation,'' remarked Governor Ridge, his smile broad but fatalistic as he noted that the decision on a running mate was entirely Mr. Bush's to make after a long process involving ''a lot of other people,'' in the Texas governor's words.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Only the November election, he said, with all the variables brought to the voters by the candidates and their campaigns, might settle the question of whether the Republican Party is ready for an abortion rights candidate on the ticket beside the anti-abortion Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''But I don't think we're done with the very important struggle we're having within the party as to how to deal with it,'' he continued. ''Certainly, my friend Governor Bush disagrees with me, and a majority of the delegates at the convention probably disagree with me.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Tom Ridge is a perfect fit for George Bush,'' said State Senator Christine M. Tartaglione, speaking in her role as the state Democratic chairwoman.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The governor's supporters quickly cite a raft of new social welfare and education laws to argue that he is the very model of the ''compassionate conservative'' that Mr. Bush has proclaimed as the cornerstone of his campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's a heck of a ride,'' the governor added. ''I've already got a great job, and I'm going to help my old friend George Bush get elected president. And you know? I think he can carry Pennsylvania without me.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  But John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, is pushing the labor federation's 68 member unions to line up behind Mr. Gore and House Democrats in general to increase their prospects in November.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Nonetheless, Mr. Sweeney acknowledged that many of the labor federation's 13 million members may be so upset about the China bill that they will sit out the November elections, a development that could hurt Mr. Gore worst in the industrial swing states of the Midwest.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In contrast, Mr. Sweeney is pushing unions to back Mr. Gore and most Democratic House candidates because in his view they are more likely to back labor on issues like Social Security and the minimum wage than are the Republicans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  David J. Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, predicted that the China battle would not hurt his party this fall. ''Obviously members of labor disagree with the vice president and some members of Congress on this,'' he said. ''But over all, these union members understand that working families are better served by making sure that Al Gore is the next president.''

  The Chinese also fear that the United States could adjust and expand a limited defense, which in its first phase will consist of a battle-management radar site in Alaska and 100 interceptors. And George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, has said the United States would develop a far more ambitious defensive system if he is elected president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  During the Bush administration, the Pentagon instructed the TRW Corporation, an American military contractor, to develop ground-based interceptors that would stop ''limited attacks by China'' using CSS-4 missiles, according to a 1993 document prepared by the United States Army.

  The good news about education has become obvious: the quality of public schools is now on center stage in national politics. From George Bush and Al Gore down to aspirants for state and local office, all politicians have embraced the cause of high standards and excellence. The bad news is that the remedy everyone but teachers and pupils wants to prescribe is more testing.

  And yet many of those offering plans to reform Social Security -- among them, of course, advisers to George W. Bush -- insist that stocks are the answer, and that it is safe to assume that stocks will keep on yielding 7 percent forever. And if you try to point out that buying a piece of corporate America is much more expensive than it used to be, they just repeat the mantra that stocks have historically been a great investment. In other words, that $100 bill was there yesterday, so it must still be there, right?

  Is the odd susceptibility of first-rate economists to such a naive fallacy a triumph of wishful thinking over analysis, or a disingenuous bow to political expediency? Recent remarks by Mr. Bush offer evidence of good old-fashioned American disingenuity at work.

  In a May 15 speech he asked his listeners to ''consider this simple fact: even if a worker chose only the safest investment in the world, an inflation-adjusted U.S. government bond, he or she would receive twice the rate of return of Social Security.'' That's an amazing fact; it's even more amazing when you realize that the Social Security system invests all its money in, you guessed it, U.S. government bonds. But the explanation -- which Mr. Bush's advisers understand very well, even if the governor does not -- is that today's workers are not only paying for their own retirement, but also supporting today's retirees. And if you think that's a minor detail -- that the question of how to meet existing obligations when workers are allowed to invest their contributions elsewhere is a side issue -- let me assure you that I too would have no trouble devising a painless plan to save Social Security, if you let me assume that a large part of the system's obligations would magically disappear.

  ''People have decided that traditional arms control is broken,'' said Stephen Hadley, a Pentagon official in the Bush administration and a campaign adviser to Gov. George W. Bush. ''We've been keeping a large inventory of nuclear weapons that we don't need and that the military doesn't want.''

  Governor Bush said last week that as president he would reduce America's nuclear arsenal to its ''lowest possible number,'' perhaps unilaterally. ''Our mutual security need no longer depend on a nuclear balance of terror,'' he declared.

  ''There's no longer this cataclysmic threat of a major war every day, so we have to put nuclear weapons into the background of international affairs,'' said Mr. Perkovich. To this end, the nuclear powers should drastically cut their arsenals and take arms off high alert, as Mr. Bush proposed last week. That would help curb atomic envy in India, Pakistan and Japan, said Mr. Perkovich, author of ''India's Nuclear Bomb'' (University of California, 1999).

  Last Wednesday, at the MCI Sports Center in Washington, the Democratic Party raised an astonishing $26.5 million at a dinner headlined by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and attended by about 12,000 loyal Democrats, some paying a half-million dollars for the privilege. This staggering sum surpassed what until then had been the  record, the $21.3 million raised less than a month before by the Republicans and George W. Bush.

  At one time or another, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have decried soft money. Even so, the soft money race proceeds at a torrid clip, without shame or remorse in either political party. As of last week, the two parties had raised at least $200 million in soft money, a record for this point in the election cycle, and they are well on their way to doubling the $260 million in soft money raised in 1996. Meanwhile, individual contributions are reaching nosebleed altitudes when some dinner guests fork over $500,000.

  The polls say that the public wants reform, and in recent months dozens of corporations have decided to boycott what they see as little more than a shakedown operation. But for the most part the political leadership seems tone deaf. Mr. Bush would preserve the soft money loophole. At the Democratic gala, Mr. Gore said that the next dinner four years from now would not cost nearly as much because as president he would bring ''meaningful'' change. But neither he nor Mr. Clinton seemed the least bit embarrassed about dipping into the trough one more time.

  Though Vice President Al Gore has been an enthusiastic advocate of wider roadless areas, his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has not. And Mr. Bush has said that he would address such issues through close consultation with state and local officials, who in Idaho and other states have been battling the administration's plans.

  Republican supporters of George W. Bush for the presidency take his word for it that he's the ''compassionate'' one, deserving to lead our country. But if he has such a human heart that he can ''suffer with'' others (as compassion means), why is he not doing something about the rush to kill in the execution chambers of his state?

  Taking the offensive against Gov. George W.

  The result, he warned graduate students at Fordham Business School in Manhattan, would be a costly taxpayer-financed bailout of failed investors that would dwarf the multibillion-dollar rescue of bankrupt savings and loans in the 1980's. And yesterday, Mr. Bush suggested he might support allowing workers to invest a large portion of their payroll taxes, which Mr. Gore said would increase the chances of financial disaster.
 </textdata>

  ''Tens of millions of investors who have not gone through the Fordham Business School, who have not had an opportunity to gain some basic knowledge to protect themselves against fraud,'' Mr. Gore said, ''would be placed in a situation where a lot of financial shenanigans could take place, where they are losing their investments because they are not equipped in the way that sophisticated investors are. It happens all the time.''

  But Mr. Bush accused the vice president of flip-flopping on the issue, releasing a videotape from January 1999 showing Mr. Gore arguing that it might make sense for the federal government to invest some revenue in the stock market to take advantage of its historically strong returns.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked on the tape whether long-term stock investments would be safe, Mr. Gore replies: ''Over any 10-year period in American history returns on equities are just significantly higher than these other returns. And in order to capture some part of that economic advantage, surely there is a way to solve these problems.''
 </textdata>

  But Mr. Bush asserted that Mr. Gore had switched positions for political purposes. ''I believe it's important to be consistent,'' he said in a news conference in Portland, Ore. ''I believe it's important to have somebody willing to take a stand.''

  The day's swirling debate underscored Mr. Gore's desire to block Mr. Bush from seizing the advantage -- particularly among young voters -- on an issue that historically has played to the strengths of Democratic candidates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush's proposal could change that dynamic by making Social Security more relevant to younger voters who have grown skeptical about the system's viability but are also comfortable with the idea of investing in Wall Street. Polls show those younger voters supported President Clinton in 1996.

  ''I think Bush is slicing into part of the Democratic coalition with this,'' said Andrew Smith, director of polling for the University of New Hampshire. ''But if older voters can be convinced that this plan is a threat to their Social Security, Bush will have problems.''

  In making Social Security a major campaign issue, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have offered sharply different proposals for extending the life of the system, which is projected to become insolvent by the year 2037.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush argues that allowing workers to invest a small portion of their payroll taxes would enable them to take advantage of the wealth created by Wall Street and reduce the cost to taxpayers of financing the system. But his plan would also leave those investors vulnerable to losses from market fluctuations.

  Mr. Gore would not change the current system that guarantees a minimum benefit. To prolong the system's life, Mr. Gore proposes using the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt and then devoting the interest saved to the retirement system. The proposal would keep the system solvent until 2054, he contends.
