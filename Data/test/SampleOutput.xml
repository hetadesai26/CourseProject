            <textdata>During my years in public office, one issue I got the most mail about was my hair, with questions
                like, ''How do you wear your hair when you're dressed up?'' I was urged to dye my hair, and people even
                enclosed checks to pay for a makeover. In no audience I've ever spoken to have I found a man who sent Al
                Gore a check for Rogaine or asked Newt Gingrich to get a haircut. I would have hoped that we could have
                erased such differences by the dawn of the 21st century. But now, it seems, the only way to imagine a
                woman in the White House is to put Barbie there. I'm sorry, but I just can't get enthusiastic. I can see
                my hero, Eleanor Roosevelt, sitting in heaven, shaking her head and saying, ''They still don't get it!''

            <textdata>Gov. George W. Bush plans to push soon for a fundamental overhaul of Social Security, reopening an
                issue that could be among the most combustible and bitterly debated of the presidential campaign.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush believes that the accounts, which would allow workers to invest a portion of their Social
                Security payroll taxes in the stock and bond markets, are an essential component of any plan to ensure
                the retirement system's long-term viability, his advisers said.

            <textdata>Private accounts would allow workers to capture some of the historically high returns offered by
                Wall Street over the long run, thereby reducing the need to close a looming shortfall in Social
                Security's finances through benefit cuts or higher taxes, Mr. Bush's aides said.

                their savings,'' said one adviser to Mr. Bush. ''The debate on Social Security will be joined in a way

            <textdata>Mr. Gore's aides said they would portray Mr. Bush's approach as too risky for many individuals
                because it would leave their retirement security exposed to the ups and downs of the stock market. They
                expect that argument to have particular resonance if Wall Street remains as volatile as it has been in
                recent months.

            <textdata>Mr. Gore has made eliminating the public debt the centerpiece of his economic agenda, saying that
                to do so would push interest rates down and give the entire economy a boost. The vice president backs a
                plan that would leave Social Security intact but would extend its solvency to 2050 by allocating
                interest savings from the reduction in the national debt to the retirement system.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush plans to give a major speech on Social Security sometime in May, and to press the issue
                from then on, his aides said. He will not offer a detailed plan, but rather will commit himself to a set
                of principles that he would use as the basis for bipartisan negotiations if he was elected president.

            <textdata>Those principles start with the establishment of private accounts. Mr. Bush will probably not
                specify what portion of a worker's payroll taxes could go into the accounts, but he is leaning toward
                making participation in the accounts voluntary, his advisers said. Under this approach, a portion of the
                retirement benefit would be guaranteed and a portion would fluctuate with the performance of the
                investment account.

            <textdata>As the system stands now, payroll taxes on today's workers go to pay benefits for current
                retirees. Mr. Bush's plan would start shifting Social Security toward a system in which each worker
                saved something for his or her own retirement.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush will also pledge not to increase payroll taxes, and not to reduce benefits for anyone in
                or nearing retirement. He has left open whether the retirement age, which is already rising gradually to
                67 from 65, might eventually need to be increased again.

            <textdata>Most of the privatization proposals put on the table in the last few years envision about two
                percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax paid by each worker being channeled into individual
                accounts. Privately, Mr. Bush's aides say they envision a plan of roughly the same scale.

            <textdata>Under Mr. Gore's plan, all of the Social Security surplus would go to reducing the national debt
                held by the public. Mr. Bush's approach would almost certainly have to forgo large-scale reduction in
                the public debt. But because Mr. Bush's plan would give workers their own retirement accounts, it would
                decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay benefits out of tax revenues, which is another
                form of debt reduction.

                who in the past could have been counted on to react strongly against any major changes to Social
                Security. Democrats remain confident that Mr. Bush's proposal will help drive older voters to Mr. Gore,
                but Republican strategists said that assumption might prove outdated.

            <textdata>''The question that this election cycle will test,'' said one adviser to Mr. Bush, ''is whether
                times have changed enough through the emergence of a new investor class, and through the recognition
                that Social Security is going broke, that new solutions can be found.''

            <textdata>The adviser said that neither party could be sure of the answer. Still, the issue is likely to
                help Democrats mobilize their traditional constituencies. In particular, Democrats said any push by Mr.
                Bush to privatize Social Security would be met by stiff resistance from labor unions.

            <textdata>Here's evidence that we're getting traction: President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have
                detected the growing political appeal of personal privacy in a time of data rape. To a commencement
                audience yesterday, Clinton unveiled his plan to repel the invaders, challenging the Republican Congress
                to get on with legislation to stem the tide of snooping.

            <textdata>Up to now, the Clinton-Gore record has been troubling to civil libertarians; under the rubric of
                searching for ''deadbeat dads,'' this administration now forces private employers to inform on workers
                to federal bureaucrats as never before. But Clinton's belated concern about penetrations of our privacy
                by marketers and e-snoops, often in support of legislation already in work, is welcome.

            <textdata>What about sharing financial data having nothing to do with medical records? Here the Clinton-Gore
                plan caves in to the secret salesmen. ''We will preserve financial firms' ability to share the
                information that they need,'' goes the administration proposal, ''to develop new products and manage
                their risks . . .'' No bank is required to obtain depositor's consent; it's up to the individual to
                ''opt out'' -- to take the difficult initiative of demanding that the bank not make his life an open
                book.

            <textdata>Governor Bush dangerously fixates on the cold war past when speaking of the use of force. He
                suggests that he would not intervene to relieve even the brutal repression of ethnic cleansing and
                genocide. No wonder it took him six weeks to say anything about our action against the ethnic cleansing
                in Kosovo. Is that the right message for America to send to people around the globe struggling for
                freedom?

            <textdata>Just this past week, Governor Bush used his brief meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov to
                issue a warning that his intention would be to build and deploy a global Star Wars system that he
                believes could defend the U.S. and all our allies against any missile launch from any source. In the
                1990's, most serious analysts took a look at the implausibility of this endeavor, the fantastical price
                that our taxpayers would be expected to pay, and the dangerously destabilizing consequences of traveling
                down that path and rejected this notion. Governor Bush wishes to return to it, and chose the worst
                possible venue in which to launch -- for lack of a better phrase -- his risky foreign policy scheme. . .

                embassies on that continent, Governor Bush said that Africa ''doesn't fit into the national strategic

                President Clinton's judicial appointments -- a partisan debasing of the honored principle under which
                the Senate advises and consents on presidential nominations. This year he has allowed confirmation of
                only seven judges. When the tables were turned in 1992, also a hotly contested election year, a
                Democratic-controlled Senate was serious enough about its responsibilities to approve 66 judges
                nominated by President George Bush, a Republican.

            <textdata>The exchange was particularly notable because foreign policy has played only a bit role in the
                presidential campaign. Mr. Bush has delivered one major speech on the subject, devoted almost entirely
                to security issues. That left him vulnerable to Mr. Gore's assertion today that the Texas governor
                ''dangerously fixates on the cold war past'' but has not dealt with the major issues of economic
                globalization that form some of the toughest foreign policy challenges.

                warrior and an isolationist. ''The interests of the U.S. are served by engagement with Russia and
                China,'' she said, ''but you have to engage them in a realistic way, not a romantic one.''

            <textdata>Neither the Gore campaign nor the Bush campaign particularly likes the analogy. The Gore team says
                it is having a high-minded policy debate and is not employing negative personal attacks. The Bush
                campaign says Mr. Gore, unlike Vice President George Bush in 1988, is misrepresenting the governor's
                record.

            <textdata>Their routes may be different, but the Gore campaign arrives at the same place Governor Bush's
                father arrived a dozen years ago. They both present a sitting vice president as the responsible steward
                of the current peace and prosperity. And they both cast the challenger as risky and irresponsible and
                his state as an alien universe that is culturally out of the mainstream. Already, Texas has been
                portrayed as such an aberration that it almost resembles, well, Massachusetts in 1988.

            <textdata>Part of this was Mr. Dukakis's fault. He did not think Vice President Bush's attacks were worth

            <textdata>This time around, Mr. Gore's chief criticism of Mr. Bush was initially confined to the governor's
                ''risky tax scheme.'' But he has ratcheted up that criticism every day. Now the word ''risky,''
                supplemented by ''irresponsible'' and ''reckless,'' is applied to the entire Bush world view. The risky
                tax scheme begets a risky economic plan, which encompasses risky health and education plans and so on.

            <textdata>So in a major foreign policy speech in Boston today, Mr. Gore criticized Mr. Bush for talking
                about a costly and controversial Star Wars missile defense plan in his meeting with the foreign minister
                of Russia and said the Texan ''chose the worst possible venue in which to launch -- for lack of a better

            <textdata>On the domestic policy front, Mr. Gore has portrayed Mr. Bush's Texas as a backwater with
                substandard education and inadequate health insurance and its residents as so gun-happy that the
                governor signed a bill allowing them to take weapons into churches. Further, Mr. Gore likes to link
                Governor Bush with the ''failed'' policies of his father and refers often to ''the Bush-Quayle
                recession.''

                the ''gaps'' in his knowledge of foreign policy with the right-wing isolationist ideology of
                Congressional Republicans like Senator Jesse Helms.

            <textdata>But if Mr. Gore has learned from the 1988 campaign, so has Governor Bush. Instead of allowing Mr.
                Gore to define him the way Vice President Bush defined Governor Dukakis, Governor Bush has tried to the
                avoid the extremist conservative box Mr. Gore has tried to put him in.

            <textdata>Governor Bush has spent much time reaching for the political center, especially on issues like

            <textdata>Governor Bush has also been quicker to respond to attacks than was Governor Dukakis. Unlike Mr.
                Dukakis, Governor Bush is not only resisting Mr. Gore's caricature of him but is constructing his own
                caricature of Mr. Gore, as the candidate who does not tell the truth and is bent on a campaign of
                destruction. The constant refrain from the Bush campaign is that Mr. Gore ''will say anything to get

            <textdata>Mr. Gore has pushed away any suggestion that he is being negative, saying he believes the country
                wants a healthy debate on the issues people care about. He has already signaled what some of those
                issues will be and how he intends to use them, as in recent days, when he excoriated Mr. Bush's record
                on the environment by calling Texas the most polluted state in the country, citing Houston's chronic air
                pollution as an example.

            <textdata>EYE ON 2004 RACE? -- Though this year's presidential primary season is not officially over, a
                coming fund-raiser in Georgia is already stoking speculation about races four years or so down the road.
                Next Monday, Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic governor of New Hampshire, will be the beneficiary of an
                event in Atlanta -- a bit south of Concord -- that planners hope will raise at least $25,000 for her
                re-election. And one of the hosts, as well as one of the contributors, will be Georgia's governor, Roy
                Barnes, a first-term Democrat who is beginning to win national attention for his policies on improving
                schools and limiting sprawl. Robert S. Kahn, Mr. Barnes's chief of staff, says his boss was simply
                supporting a fellow Democratic governor, not pocketing a chit to be cashed later, in time for New
                Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary in 2004 or 2008. ''The only election he's interested in, other
                than legislative elections, is his own re-election,'' Mr. Kahn insisted. The event is being organized by
                Michael Coles, a prominent party fund-raiser and Barnes ally who met Ms. Shaheen while working for Vice
                President Al Gore in New Hampshire last winter.

            <textdata>In an October 1999 letter from Vice President Al Gore to Mr. Putin, who was then the prime
                minister, the Clinton administration complained that Russia was failing to take action against Russian
                institutions that were still assisting Iran's missile program. Mr. Savelyev said the letter was read to
                him by a member of Mr. Putin's staff.

                forward and not back. I hold no rancor. Others will be the judge of this campaign, not me.

            <textdata>MR. McCAIN. -- I think the single most important reason is that Governor Bush is the most
                qualified person to be president of the United States. He has the vision; he has the knowledge and the
                expertise to carry out the mission of maintaining United States supremacy, both militarily and
                economically in the world.

        <entry>
            <date>5-10-2000</date>
            <textdata>I think that it's clear that Governor Bush's philosophy, his ideals and his ability to articulate
                a vision for the future is the major reason why he should be president of the United States and not Al
                Gore.

            <textdata>And I want to emphasize one more time, and I made it very clear to Governor Bush, I will continue
                to pursue the issues of reform. That is the agenda that drove me in my campaign and will drive me as
                long as I am in public service. I believe we will have disagreements, but I also believe we will have a
                lot more agreements than disagreements. And I think our discussions and our debate will be healthy, and
                in the long run helpful to the party and the country.

            <textdata>McCain Endorses Bush, Citing Goals and Values Senator John McCain endorsed Gov. George W. Bush and
                pledged to help the de facto Republican presidential nominee win the White House for their party. The
                announcement followed a private 90-minute meeting in Pittsburgh between the two primary campaign rivals.
                Mr. McCain indicated that common goals and shared values transcended the animosity that grew out of

            <textdata>For a defeated candidate in the Republican presidential race, Senator John McCain has not suffered
                from lack of attention. With his high poll numbers, Mr. McCain might have made a credible third-party

                joking that he preferred taking his medicine now rather than later. Clearly he figured that he had a
                brighter future inside the G.O.P. than as a spoiler outside it. It was disappointing that Mr. Bush

            <textdata>In approaching the meeting with Mr. McCain yesterday, Mr. Bush seemed to have this history in
                mind. He made it clear that he wanted the senator's endorsement, but did not want to seem to want it too
                much. In their joint news conference the governor tried to stress how much they had in common. But he
                did not look especially pleased about Mr. McCain's vow to continue pressing his agenda. He may have been
                wondering whether the senator would try to do that at the convention in Philadelphia this summer.

            <textdata>The continuing popularity of Mr. McCain can be seen in many surveys, including a recent NBC/Wall
                Street Journal poll showing that 23 percent of the voters would prefer him over Mr. Bush or Vice
                President Al Gore. The USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll shows him with higher approval ratings than either man.
                The Bush campaign has always been quick to assert that Mr. McCain got his biggest victories in states
                where independents and Democrats could join with Republicans and vote in the primary. But it is these
                independent-minded voters who will determine the winner in November. It will not be easy for either Mr.
                Bush or Mr. Gore, both wealthy political heirs, to attract voters who are drawn to Mr. McCain's outsider
                appeal.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush, for his part, has been resistant to identifying with two issues that seem intrinsic to
                Mr. McCain's appeal. One is campaign finance reform, particularly the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban,
                which Mr. Bush opposes. Another is Mr. McCain's opposition to a gigantic tax cut that would use up the
                budget surplus. Mr. Bush probably feels locked in on taxes, but he would be smart to adopt Mr. McCain's
                stand on campaign finance reform. Otherwise he may find that McCain voters are as hard to get as the
                senator's endorsement was.

                heralded a new phase in a rocky political relationship that went from remarkable amity in December to

            <textdata>He did not actually use the words ''endorse'' or ''endorsement'' until reporters pressed him to
                make sure they understood correctly what was going on. At that point, Mr. McCain made something of a

                Mr. McCain if his actions today -- an almost inevitable obligation for any politician wishing to remain
                loyal to his party -- were like swallowing a dose of necessary medicine sooner rather than later, Mr.
                McCain answered, ''I think 'take the medicine now' probably is a good description.''

                deadpan humor, and it did not diminish their conviction, shared by many Republican operatives, that the

                Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and John Engler of Michigan.

            <textdata>Political analysts said Mr. McCain's eventual endorsement of Mr. Bush was never really in much
                doubt, in part because the senator, seen as something of a maverick in his own party, needed to show his
                peers that he could follow the loyal, polite course. That would be critical if Mr. Bush loses and Mr.
                McCain seeks to become the party's nominee four years from now.

                morning's meeting, scheduled a month ago, would bring the waiting to an end. Mr. McCain's previous
                statements that he would support the party's nominee fell short of a formal seal of approval and fueled
                speculation, which Mr. Bush's aides were eager to quell, about what was taking so long.

                disagreements, although they declined to linger on them. During the primaries, for example, Mr. McCain
                repeatedly asserted that the size of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut might jeopardize the health of Social
                Security.

                wooing McCain supporters, Mr. Gore has also been going after the backers of Jesse Ventura, the

            <textdata>BUSH AHEAD IN NEW POLL -- The latest national presidential preference poll shows Mr. Bush taking a
                substantial eight-point lead over Mr. Gore, 51 percent to 43 percent. The poll, published yesterday in
                The Los Angeles Times, surveyed 1,211 registered voters, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or
                minus three percentage points. It was conducted from May 4 to 7, just about the same time that a poll
                done for the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found Mr. Bush barely edging Mr. Gore, 46
                percent to 45 percent. That poll, conducted May 2 to 6 and covering 940 registered voters, has a margin
                of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Meanwhile, in polls conducted last week in
                six of the largest and most politically important states by the American Research Group of Manchester,
                N.H., Mr. Bush leads Mr. Gore by 7 percentage points in Florida, 47 points in Texas and 3 points in
                Pennsylvania, whereas Mr. Gore leads by 14 points in California and 20 in New York. In Illinois, there
                is a tie. Over all, according to the latest available state polls, Mr. Bush is ahead in 17 states (good
                for 183 of the required 270 electoral votes), and Mr. Gore leads in 10 states (good for 146 electoral
                votes).

            <textdata>A MESSAGE FROM WOMEN -- Mr. Gore, who polls indicate is having difficulty maintaining the
                traditional Democratic advantage with women, has been put on notice by two dozen women's organizations
                that he needs to work harder to win women's political allegiance. In an hourlong session on Tuesday in
                the Old Executive Office Building with about 40 leaders of the women's groups, the vice president was
                told he needed a better media strategy to convey his positions on issues like Social Security, paycheck
                fairness, domestic violence and abortion. ''The message isn't getting out to women,'' Kim Gandy,
                executive vice president of the National Organization for Women, said in an interview after the meeting.
                Nancy Zirkin, a spokeswoman for the American Association of University Women, said the meeting was
                requested four months ago, on a nonpartisan basis, so the women could hold a general discussion with Mr.
                Gore about their concerns. She said the request was not prompted by the vice president's lag in the
                polls or by growing polling evidence that the Democratic candidate's edge with women was beginning to
                erode. Mr. Gore, who was accompanied at the meeting by Donna Brazile, his campaign manager; Donna E.
                Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, and Alexis M. Herman, the secretary of labor,
                agreed to additional meetings. Ms. Brazile suggested after the meeting that the women's groups could
                help him get out his message. ''But we're not in any trouble with women voters,'' she insisted.

            <textdata>A New York University political science professor, Lawrence Mead, was brought in one day a week to
                provide advice for about $1,000 a day, city officials said. And an executive at a conservative
                social-services research organization, the Hudson Institute of Indianapolis, was retained. That
                executive, Andrew Bush, was ultimately selected for a permanent high-level job as an agency
                administrator.

            <textdata>''To many of our seniors, illness can be a path to financial ruin, and this is one of the greatest
                fears of retirement and our nation must address it as we head into the 21st century,'' Mr. Bush, the
                likely Republican presidential nominee, told about 80 people at a nursing home here.

            <textdata>The scope and expense of Mr. Bush's proposal was modest -- it would cost $7.4 billion over five
                years -- and some critics said it would make only the smallest of dents in a problem that is becoming
                ever more severe. But the plan represents an effort to demonstrate that Mr. Bush is paying heed to
                health care and to elderly people, an issue and a voting bloc that could be decisive in the presidential
                election this fall.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush seemed to take the dynamics of the electorate into full account with remarks that aimed
                for a kind of political trifecta, singling out and offering reassurances not only to the elderly but
                also to baby boomers and to women. His message to baby boomers was that their anticipatory qualms about
                retirement were foremost in his mind, while his nod to women was his recognition that they typically
                shoulder most of the responsibility for older relatives.

            <textdata>But the elderly were arguably his most important audience, because Vice President Al Gore has

            <textdata>Mr. Bush was clearly trying to challenge that claim. He intends to follow today's proposals with a

            <textdata>The high stakes of the presidential candidates' jostling over these issues was suggested by the

            <textdata>Dr. Shalala did not seem to be fully aware about what, exactly, Mr. Bush was recommending, but she
                said the plausibility of all of his proposals was thrown into doubt by his call for a tax cut of $483
                billion over five years, which is much larger than the tax cut Mr. Gore favors.

            <textdata>Dr. Shalala also said that Mr. Bush's financial incentives to buy long-term care insurance did
                nothing to address the flaws of many of the policies on the market and that the exemption that Mr. Bush
                would grant home caregivers was nowhere near as generous as the $3,000 tax credit that the Clinton
                administration had proposed and that Mr. Gore supports. The exemption, for someone in a 15 percent tax
                bracket would amount to only a few hundred dollars a year.

            <textdata>Long-term care insurance, which fills a gap in what is provided by private and corporate health
                care policies and Medicare, covers the cost of an extended stay in a nursing home or assisted-living
                center for people whose financial resources have not dwindled to the point where they qualify for
                Medicaid. Figures provided by the Bush campaign indicated, only about 5 percent of Americans had such
                policies.

                policy that guaranteed two years of nursing home care, and $507 for a policy that guaranteed five years;
                a 64-year-old would pay about $1,265 for the two-year guarantee and $1,709 for the five-year one. The
                older the person buying the policy, the more it costs.

                would be unable to afford such a policy even after Mr. Bush's deduction, which would shave only a few

            <textdata>The Bush plan also sets no income ceiling for eligibility, so that wealthy Americans in higher tax
                brackets would save more on the policies than middle-class Americans, because the tax deduction would be

            <textdata>But an aide to Mr. Bush said the plan was not intended primarily for these people, many of whom
                have jobs that already offer long-term care benefits and thus would not qualify for the deduction.

                important to put mechanisms into place to encourage their financial security and to decrease the number
                who will end up needing public money and help.

                supporters on his campaign list, that recalled that he had promised at the start of his campaign to

            <textdata>BUSH COMMENTS ON 2 POSSIBLE RUNNING MATES -- When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was asked about
                vice-presidential candidates in an interview with the Lifetime women's cable channel yesterday, he had
                notably different reactions to two names, suggesting that he was concerned about appearing too open to
                the idea of a running mate who strongly supports abortion rights. Asked if Elizabeth Dole, an opponent
                of abortion, was on his list, he said that she was and then praised her as ''a good friend of mine who
                has had a great career.'' But when asked about Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who supports
                abortion rights and whose selection would undoubtedly provoke many religious conservatives, Mr. Bush's
                response seemed conspicuously restrained. ''There's a lot of people on the list,'' he said.

            <textdata>ANOTHER SURVEY SHOWS A STRONG BUSH LEAD -- For the second time this week, a national presidential
                preference poll has Gov. George W. Bush leading Vice President Al Gore by at least half a dozen
                percentage points. The newest survey, released yesterday by the Voter.com group, puts Mr. Bush ahead by
                48 percent to 42 percent. A poll released on Wednesday by The Los Angeles Times had Mr. Bush ahead by
                eight percentage points. Like the Times poll, the Voter.com poll found Mr. Bush now pulling about as
                much of the female vote as Mr. Gore, though that voting segment has traditionally leaned heavily to
                Democrats. Mr. Bush continues to lead among men, and he has moved ahead in the struggle for
                independents, a toss-up earlier. The Voter.com poll also found Mr. Bush leading among Democrats who had
                supported Ronald Reagan and also found that half of all voters had grown pessimistic about the state of
                the nation and its direction, despite the strong economy. Asked to rank top issues for Congress, voters
                most often mentioned ''restoring moral values,'' followed by education. They said Republicans would be
                best at restoring moral values -- 6 in 10 disapproved of President Clinton ''as a person'' -- but
                believed Democrats would do more for education. The poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters from May 1 to May
                3 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

            <textdata>GORE MAKES MOST OF WASHINGTON CONNECTIONS -- Many are the perks of being vice president,
                particularly when you are running for president. Al Gore demonstrated that anew this week, first by
                handing out what his office called ''deliverables'' -- more than $25 million in grants to expand tourism
                and businesses in the financially struggling Mississippi Delta -- and then by announcing
                ''improvements'' in veterans' education benefits worth $1.2 billion over five years. (Never mind that
                the money will come from savings in other veterans' programs.) Mr. Gore boasted that the improvements
                were ''the single largest increase in veterans' education benefits'' in more than 15 years. Gov. George
                W. Bush called Mr. Gore hypocritical because the Clinton administration had earlier proposed sharp cuts
                in veterans' benefits.

            <textdata>Politically, voters who take a strong pro-control position overwhelmingly favor Mr. Gore on this
                issue, while those who hold the opposite point of view think Mr. Bush best represents them. But voters
                with a mixed or moderate position tend to have more confidence in Mr. Bush than in Mr. Gore, according
                to Pew Research Center surveys. The judgments of the ''moderates'' at this point probably have less to
                do with knowledge of what the candidates believe about specific controls and rest more on hunches about
                them personally.

            <textdata>A second component of this is gender, one of the most important prisms in this campaign,
                especially when it comes to guns. Men have more confidence in Mr. Bush and women more faith in Mr. Gore

            <textdata>How, and if, the issue affects voter decisions will hinge on the outcome of the campaigns for and
                against gun control. Can the likes of a million moms do what the N.R.A. has done for years -- mold
                single-issue voters? Can Mr. Bush hold the middle on this issue while hanging onto the Second Amendment
                advocates? Can Mr. Gore effectively draw in more female supporters who favor controls without further
                alienating men who have less commitment to this cause?

            <textdata>So when Mr. Gore stumps for gun control, as he often does these days, many Democrats here,
                particularly men, squirm. To them, the issue is a divisive headache that drives their friends and
                neighbors into the arms of Mr. Gore's presumed Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a
                frequent critic of gun control.

            <textdata>For Mr. Gore, winning this fall will almost certainly require keeping places like Beaver County
                solidly in the Democratic column, political analysts say. But therein lies the risk of gun control:
                While the issue plays well among suburban women, it infuriates many men in places like western
                Pennsylvania. Mr. Gore already trails Mr. Bush among men by double-digit margins, recent polls show.

            <textdata>But to the chagrin of Democrats like Mr. Stupak, Mr. Gore supports gun control proposals that go
                well beyond simple safety measures like trigger locks. He would require states to create photo licenses
                for buyers of new handguns. He would ban the cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials and limit
                handgun purchases to one a month. He supports lawsuits by counties and cities against gun makers. And he
                accuses Mr. Bush of being a pawn of the rifle association.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush, by contrast, contends that the federal government should enforce existing gun laws
                rather than enact new ones, a basic tenet of the N.R.A. As governor, he signed legislation that allows
                people to carry concealed weapons into churches, among other places, and that prohibits municipalities
                from directly suing gun makers. Recently, he suggested that he would also sign anti-lawsuit legislation
                as president.

            <textdata>What further complicates the issue for Mr. Gore is that there are many places like Beaver County
                in the necklace of northern states that Democratic strategists say he needs to win, including
                Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan. In recent visits to those states, he has tended to avoid

                in 1996, when the race was a rout. But this year's contest is expected to be close, meaning gun control
                could emerge as a significant factor. And history has shown the N.R.A. to be better at mobilizing its
                voters than gun control proponents have been at energizing theirs.

                apparently concerned that the issue poses risks for him, as well. Clearly, gun control is widely
                supported not only in Democratic cities but also many Republican suburbs. And it is popular in
                California, the largest state, and New Jersey, an important swing state.

            <textdata>But the greatest risk for Mr. Bush on gun control is among women. Most polls show that women, by
                significantly higher margins than men, favor gun control and distrust the N.R.A. The higher the income
                and education level, the more supportive women are of restrictions on guns.

                can win it with enough votes to offset Mr. Bush's gains in less Democratic districts. Gun control is
                likely to be a factor in determining that level of enthusiasm.

                Davis of California, a Democrat who is an ally of Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Bush's expected rival in
                the presidential race. Governors Bush, Gray and Jane Dee Hull, an Arizona Republican, will meet on June
                1 and June 2 with their counterparts from six Mexican border states. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Mindy
                Tucker, said yesterday that the agenda included education, economic development and the environment.
                Last month, Mr. Bush met with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico at the dedication of the eight-lane,
                $128 million World Trade Bridge in Nuevo Laredo, just over the border from Texas.

            <textdata>Vice President Al Gore stepped into two contentious local issues in Oregon today, saying that he
                would ''work for a quick resolution'' on whether to breach the Snake River dams to protect endangered
                salmon, and, according to a key Democrat, saying he was opposed to the state's law allowing assisted
                suicide.

                ''I think that states should have the discretion to explore this new set of issues involving what role
                doctors should play when a patient is in extremis at the end of life. You know, any family that's been
                in that kind of situation knows that doctors sometimes have experience that could be brought to bear
                usefully. You know, there are so many different situations, I think that states ought to deal with that

            <textdata>Local Democrats have been urging Mr. Gore to take a leadership role on some of these polarizing
                local matters. He was greeted today by a front-page article in The Oregonian in which the governor, John
                Kitzhaber, who supported Mr. Gore's opponent, former Senator Bill Bradley, in the Democratic
                presidential primaries, said he did not understand why Mr. Gore had not spoken out on the salmon issue.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush's announcement about trigger locks marked the latest step in a striking evolution of his
                position on them. It also suggested an awareness of gun control's potential as a potent issue in the
                2000 elections and a concern with Mr. Gore's ability to portray the governor as an opponent of sensible
                restrictions on firearms.

            <textdata>Mr. Gore and his aides consistently draw attention to certain aspects of Mr. Bush's record on
                guns, most notably a 1995 law permitting Texans with proper training and licenses to carry concealed
                handguns. Mr. Bush also signed into law last year a measure making it extremely difficult for Texas
                cities and counties to sue gun manufacturers, and he has indicated support for similar legislation on
                the federal level.

            <textdata>As for weapons and child safety, Mr. Bush did support a 1995 Texas law that held parents
                criminally liable if their firearms ended up in the hands of children and caused injury as a result. But
                as recently as last year, he said he opposed the mandatory sale of trigger locks or other child safety
                devices with handguns and supported voluntary measures instead.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush's aides said today that his plan to distribute free trigger locks was consistent with his
                belief that it would be most effective and plausible to encourage voluntary use of them. The Texas
                program, in which gun owners will be able to obtain the locks at local police and fire stations, is to
                be financed by $5 million over five years in discretionary spending by the governor.

                correctly than trusted Mr. Gore.

                particularly several cases in which he said prosecutors seemed more concerned with scoring victories, in
                the form of capital convictions, than with justice.

                ''That's why I voted to commute.'' A majority of the 18-member board would have to have voted for

                ''Everyone in Texas hopes and prays that that's the case. I do not share his view.'' For such certainty

                Bush's tenure -- including interviews with jurors, prosecutors, judges, witnesses and co-defendants

                at the very least, the risk of an innocent person being sent to death row. Although most of the

                the legal system that sent them to their deaths.

                January, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who supports the death penalty, announced a
                moratorium on executions while a thorough review is conducted of the state's criminal justice system.
                Mr. Ryan, who is Mr. Bush's state campaign chairman, described his state's system, where 13 death row
                inmates have been exonerated since 1987, 11 of them since 1994, as ''fraught with error.''

            <textdata>In the last year, 13 states have had bills pending that would have halted executions. Asked on
                ''Meet the Press'' if he would consider following the lead of Governor Ryan, Mr. Bush said he would not.
                Asked why he thought Mr. Ryan had taken the action, Mr. Bush answered: ''Maybe they've had some problems
                in their courts. Maybe they've had some faulty judgments.''

                capital cases in a lengthy telephone interview.

            <textdata>Then, in an unusual move, seven members of the state parole board voted for clemency, but 10
                opposed it and one abstained. Mr. Farris was executed in January 1999. During Mr. Bush's tenure, the
                parole board has granted clemency to only one death row inmate, according to the board's statistics; as
                of the end of April, it had rejected 68 clemency petitions.

                the next state, Virginia, with 52, and more than all the executions put together in the next four states
                -- Missouri with 31, Oklahoma with 21, South Carolina with 20 and Arizona with 18. Texas has 12
                executions scheduled for May and June. The state has 462 people on death row, second only to California,
                with 561 death row inmates (California, in contrast, has executed 8 people). Ann W. Richards, the
                liberal Democratic governor who preceded Mr. Bush, presided over the executions of a then-record 50
                death row inmates.

            <textdata>Last year, Governor Bush vetoed a modest indigent defense bill that its backers said would have
                improved the quality of representation in criminal cases. It would have given counties the authority to
                set up public defender offices, which only a handful now have, and curbed the power of judges to appoint
                their friends and campaign contributors to represent indigents. For a small-town practitioner, these
                appointments can be a lucrative source of income; to remain in the good graces of the judges who dole
                them out, some lawyers feel bound to move cases quickly. The bill would also have required that a lawyer
                be appointed within 20 days after a person is arraigned. There is no limit now.

                eyewitnesses, that he had committed the arson-murder for which he was convicted, on the eve of his
                scheduled execution nearly 20 years later a law enforcement official had gnawing doubts. The official,
                Joseph Stewart, an arson investigator in Wichita Falls, arrested a man for a different arson who it
                turned out had been at the arson for which Mr. Hogue had been convicted. The arsons seemed disturbingly
                similar, Mr. Stewart said in an interview, and he called Governor Bush's office several times, pleading
                for a reprieve of 30 days in order to pursue the new evidence.

            <textdata>Perhaps because the rate of clemency is so low, lawyers may not always put their full energies
                into applying for it, said a former lawyer in the governor's general counsel office from 1989 to 1998,
                Jim Sallans, who reviewed hundreds of clemency petitions in capital cases. He said he ''supports the way
                Governor Bush handles clemency in capital cases,'' and he said he had no doubt that all those executed
                under the governor were guilty.

                Republicans who showed up in Austin begging the governor to run. But after Bush lost to Senator John
                McCain in New Hampshire and later in Michigan, there was widespread panic among campaign contributors
                and plenty of grousing from Daddy Bush's old team: what did this Rove really know about running a
                national campaign? The question hasn't gone away either. In his own party, he is seen by many as both
                too inexperienced and too smitten by his candidate to be of much use. Yet the story here is not ''Jethro

                help adding, sneeringly: ''But do you repopulate the campaign with people from 1908? No!''

            <textdata>There are other concerns about Rove: he cannot hope to maintain airtight message control -- the
                hallmark of his earlier campaigns, including W.'s gubernatorial runs -- in the circus atmosphere of a
                presidential race. And quite possibly, Rove's arrogance and his tendency to take politics personally are
                not the ideal check on Bush's arrogance and tendency to take politics personally. But Republicans can
                stop worrying that Karl Rove is too down-home, laid-back, blissed out or otherwise insufficiently
                aggressive for the job.

            <textdata>At one point during that big evening at the Four Seasons, Rove retreated to a hotel suite upstairs
                to crunch numbers and monitor TV chat. He phoned the Bush campaign's communications director, Karen
                Hughes, to tell her what to say on the air. (Earlier, he had also told her what to tell Bush to say.)
                Then he disappeared into the bathroom with his cell phone to take a call from Bush.

            <textdata>Rove and his boss had been on the phone throughout the day, and from his office at Bush central
                that afternoon, he gave Bush the good news from the exit polls, taking special pleasure in the McCain
                campaign ''meltdown,'' as he called it.

            <textdata>''It's not pretty, they say,'' he told Bush on the phone. ''It's not pretty how the numbers are
                being received. He's going to Arizona, and the scuttlebutt is he's going to his cabin and nobody thinks
                he can continue. Yeah, recriminations, finger-pointing. No, over there. Oh, big time. It's
                unbelievable.'' They dished McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, or at least Rove did: ''Yeah, he is a
                bad guy. This guy was a lobbyist for Imelda Marcos and General Abacha of Nigeria! Just the consummate
                inside-D.C. thug. He needs adult supervision.'' (Davis's firm, though not Davis himself, did some work
                for Marcos and for Nigeria when Abacha was in power.)

            <textdata>Just as Rove finished talking to Bush from the hotel bathroom that evening, boisterous,
                good-natured Karen Hughes burst into the suite, and Rove told her he just wanted to ''get New York over

                performing. ''He's really gotten good at doing these satellite feeds,'' she said. ''He'd never done any
                before.''

            <textdata>College was off and on: Rove began at the University of Utah in 1969, thinking of majoring in
                political science, but after his parents split up during his freshman year, he says, ''I had to start to
                fend for myself.'' To earn money for school, he worked in a convenience store and was robbed at
                gunpoint. And he never did get a degree, still a tender spot with him. One thing he seems to like best
                about Bush, in fact, is that the governor seems to share some of Rove's resentment of Ivy Leaguers,
                though he is one himself.

            <textdata>''I guess I'm more cerebral and lack his great people skills,'' Rove said. ''And I'm more of a
                nerd. Lee was a nerd in high school, but then he learned to play the guitar and talk to girls, and I
                never did. That's serious.'' They both met George Bush in that job, of course, and his son George W.
                too. And both Rove and Atwater ended up going to work for the elder Bush -- Rove down in Texas, where he
                has been ever since.

            <textdata>When I asked people who have worked with Rove in Texas what makes a classic ''Karl campaign,''
                they all used the same word: control. He picks a few campaign themes and goes to great pains to keep his
                candidates on message. A year before Bush first ran for governor, against Ann Richards in 1994, he was
                invited to participate in a little skit being put on by a Republican women's group in Dallas, and Rob
                Allyn, a Republican consultant who was working on the event, got a call from Rove. ''He said Bush would
                make fun of himself, his mother or whatever,'' Allyn recalled recently, ''but he would not under any
                circumstances make fun of Ann Richards and would appear only on that condition.'' Allyn was floored:
                ''It's a year out! Bush hasn't even said he's running. This is a skit for the faithful. But Karl has
                decided that they're not going to run against Ann's personality, because she has a great personality, so
                he's on the phone, all serious.''

            <textdata>There are also a lot of stories of Rove's bullying on behalf of Bush. Frank Cahoon, one of the
                first Republicans ever elected to the Texas House (he is now retired from politics and living in
                Midland) heard from Rove after Cahoon openly disagreed with some of the appointments Bush made upon
                being elected governor. He called one Sunday night and went on for an hour, Cahoon recalled: ''Karl was
                reading me the riot act as a traitor. I said, 'Who cares what some old man out here in the desert
                thinks?''' Cathie Adams, who heads the Texas Eagle Forum, a conservative antifeminist group, said that
                after she criticized some of Bush's policies, she got a call from Rove, too: ''You don't cross him
                unless you want a lot of grief and threats.''

            <textdata>A friend of mine in Texas, Anne Marie Kilday, a former colleague at The Dallas Morning News, says
                Rove called her at home early one morning during Bush's race against Richards. Republicans had been
                shopping a story about supposed malfeasance by a female state official Kilday covered. According to
                Kilday, Rove said he was looking over the telephone records of this official, who is a lesbian, and said
                he found it interesting that there had been a number of calls to Kilday from the official ''at your
                residence.'' Kilday recalled, ''He said, 'You've just got to be careful about your reputation and what
                people might think.'''

            <textdata>The feeling in the Bush camp seems to be that whatever Rove has done has worked pretty well so
                far; he is fully in charge and likely to remain so. Rove's friend Reggie Bashur, who has worked for Bush
                in the past, probably summed it up best: ''They're winning, so it's like that old saying, 'If it ain't
                broke, don't fix it.''' And Rove himself sounds downright complacent about making the leap onto the
                national stage. ''It's not much different,'' he said. ''In some ways, it's easier, because there are
                more places where they haven't heard the same thing'' repeated over and over. Moving into the summer,
                Rove seems to be relying on classic back-to-the-middle moves, getting Bush talking about health care for
                the poor, for example.

            <textdata>One piece of good news for Bush is that Rove is not starry-eyed about his man, as is widely
                believed -- he has enough distance to make cool decisions. There is no question he is wild about Bush as
                a candidate. But he seems to see Bush as much as a symbol as a man. Once, when I asked him if the
                Republican takeover in Texas would have been possible without a George W. Bush, he thought about it for
                a minute, then said, ''If George W. Bush didn't exist, we'd have to find a way to create somebody like
                him.''

            <textdata>She shook her head. ''I don't think so,'' she said. ''Neither one of them is going to volunteer
                their deepest feelings. It's a relationship where Bush just tells you how it is. If he's hungry, it's,
                'When's dinner?' and if he's tired, it's, 'I'm going to bed.'''

            <textdata>Bush has often said he loves Rove's loyalty, and there is the fact that Rove sold his business to
                devote all his energies to him. But how the candidate really feels about his chief handler is difficult
                to say; he doesn't like to see too many articles about the help and initially didn't want to be quoted
                in this one about Rove. ''We handed him the phone and he refused -- he said he just wasn't going to do
                it,'' a Bush aide explained apologetically. ''He doesn't mind you doing staff stories,'' this aide
                added, though no one had suggested that he did. ''But he doesn't always weigh in.''

                understand you're writing an article on Karl. I've known Karl a long time, since about 1972. I know him
                as a friend, and I've been in combat with him, political combat, on more than one occasion. I think -- I
                know -- he's brilliant. He is very witty and fun to be around. He's well read and an all-around good
                man. Thank you for your interest'' -- long pause -- in Karl.''

                the public debt, but also the special bonds it is issuing to the Social Security system in ever-growing
                amounts, representing promises to pay retirement benefits in decades ahead. By that accounting, the
                current $5.6 trillion in total debt will grow inexorably for years to come.

                agenda. He wants to use excess Social Security revenue -- more than $2 trillion over the next decade --

                extend the system's solvency from 2037 to around 2050 without cutting benefits, raising payroll taxes or
                altering the way Social Security works.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush's approach is different. This week he plans to set out a goal of adding private
                investment accounts to Social Security, a major change that would require hundreds of billions, if not
                trillions, of dollars over the next decade. The only place to find that money is the Social Security
                surplus.

                government's financial condition. Because the private investment accounts would replace part of the
                government's obligation to pay Social Security benefits in the long run, his approach would in effect
                reduce the debt, broadly defined.

            <textdata>The scale of any reduction in total debt under Mr. Bush's approach would depend on the amount of
                money committed to the private accounts, a decision that Mr. Bush says should be made through bipartisan
                negotiations after he is elected.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush bucks mainstream economic thinking to a degree when he plays down the importance of
                wiping out the public debt. But at heart, his plan is about transferring some control of retirement
                finances from the government to individuals -- a most basic conservative value.

            <textdata>Behind this long-running imperial racket is a crew of Dick Tracy-like characters, including the
                former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, who ''resembled a salamander,'' and the ''prune-faced'' former
                prime minister Noboru Takeshita. (It's true that Kishi, whom I had occasion to interview, was no Clark
                Gable, and did have a complicated past, but I confess that I totally missed the face thing with
                Takeshita and, on the whole, found Japanese pols no slipperier, say, than Al Gore among the Buddhist
                nuns.)

                people born between 1946 and 1964) has infused the presidential campaign with a new urgency, especially
                regarding Social Security and health care. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have devoted much time on the
                campaign trail to Social Security and both plan to deliver major addresses on the topic on Monday.

                systems that are in very good shape, and the anxiety about your own retirement is on the top of people's

                closer to the counterculture than was Mr. Bush, but still by no means a radical -- both are invoking
                their generational roots as themes in their campaigns and are developing ''responsibility'' as
                rationales for their candidacies.

                irresponsibility of President Clinton (the first baby boomer president). The goal of his candidacy, Mr.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush has emphasized the theme since he began his campaign last June, saying ''My first goal is
                to usher in the responsibility era -- an era that stands in stark contrast to the last few decades,
                where our culture has said: If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a problem, blame someone else.''

            <textdata>This, of course, necessitates presenting Mr. Bush as the ''irresponsible'' alternative, a neat
                way, learned from President Clinton, of transforming a policy matter into a values judgment. Repeatedly,
                Mr. Gore casts Mr. Bush's proposals as ''reckless,'' a quality Mr. Gore conjures up with his relentless
                referencing to Mr. Bush's ''risky tax scheme.'' The contrast between the responsible Mr. Gore and the
                irresponsible Mr. Bush has fast become the organizing principle of the Gore campaign.

            <textdata>Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore is using the idea of responsibility to reinforce one of the basic tenets
                of his party. While Mr. Bush's reference summons family values, Mr. Gore's highlights the Democrats'
                traditional advantage on preserving entitlement programs. The ''risky tax scheme'' that he invokes is a
                direct threat to two tenets of Democratic orthodoxy -- Social Security and Medicare -- that baby boomers
                are now either depending on to help their parents or expecting to receive themselves.

            <textdata>Because Mr. Gore had children relatively early for his generation, he is now a grandparent. ''His
                life cycle is slightly ahead of his generation, so he can see ahead to the centrality of some of these
                issues,'' Ms. Kamark said. Still, Mr. Gore is more a creature of the popular image of the baby boom than
                is Mr. Bush.

            <textdata>Novak thinks that a big reason for the party's disarray is that it has succumbed to the illusion
                that it can govern the country from Capitol Hill. Republicans watched George Mitchell run rings around
                George Bush and concluded not just that they had landed a dud for a president but that the balance of
                power had shifted. The result was disaster. The White House is a centralized operation that can shape
                day-to-day political debate. Capitol Hill is a world of warring chieftains and headless chickens. The
                unequal battle has left the Republicans thoroughly ''Clintonized'': obsessed with polls and competing to
                spend more public money than their rivals. The only way that the Republicans can complete the revolution
                is to retake the White House.

            <textdata>The repetition probably had the effect Mr. McCain intended: it reduced the term to ridiculousness.
                Still smarting over the negative turn that the primary campaign -- and some of Mr. Bush's commercials --
                had taken, Mr. McCain had for weeks resisted falling into line behind the presumptive Republican
                nominee. When he finally did so last week, saying Mr. Bush had the ''vision, knowledge and expertise''
                to be president -- and that he himself had no interest in being Mr. Bush's vice president -- there was a
                tight, grudging quality to the event.

            <textdata>Democrats clearly hoped that the rallies would mark a sea change in the politics of gun control
                and an end to the truism that the gun lobby can turn out its vote, while the forces of gun control
                cannot. Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who attended today's march in Washington, said, in a
                reference to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee: ''Bush ought
                to be terrified. Look out there -- that is the face of the soccer mom.''

            <textdata>But polls have shown that women are almost evenly divided in their views of how the two
                presidential candidates handle the gun issue. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll asked,
                ''Regardless of which candidate you prefer for president, who do you agree with more on the issue of gun
                control -- Al Gore or George W. Bush?'' Thirty-five percent of the women said they agreed more with Mr.
                Gore, while 30 percent said they agreed more with Mr. Bush. Among mothers, 33 percent said they agree
                more with Mr. Bush, 24 percent with Mr. Gore.

                some of his fellow Army command ers, who methodically and cautiously maneuvered their units on the

                of cutting off many of the Iraqi forces when President Bush announced that a cease-fire would take place
                after 100 hours of ground combat.

            <textdata>In that regard, many of us -- even some scandalmongers -- draw a line between private life and
                public conduct. I'm for full disclosure of financial dealings past and present, but what candidates do
                in their bedrooms is none of our business, and I really don't care if Al Gore or George W. Bush smoked
                pot or worse in their youth. Both Giuliani and his former flack deny his wife's charge of an affair; in

            <textdata>Similar reactions have been suggested in recent national polls. They have found that Mr. Bush is
                preferred by women, particularly married women and mothers. The results have caused enough concern among
                Gore supporters that last week representatives of groups like the National Organization for Women met

                untrustworthy.

                locked in place.

            <textdata>The campaign's difficulties have been magnified by several recent opinion polls that show Mr. Gore
                trailing Mr. Bush in virtually every demographic category. Many surveys have found that Mr. Bush is
                leading Mr. Gore among almost every age and income group nationally except for elderly voters; Mr. Bush
                has had more success drawing independents and, strikingly, he is even outperforming Mr. Gore among
                married women, traditionally a more Democratic constituency. In several important states that are
                usually reliably Democratic -- like Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin -- surveys show
                that the vice president faces unusually tight competition.

                part, insisted that Mr. Gore would not shrink from his aggressive tone. ''The public wants somebody who
                will fight,'' he said.

                in the polls, but on how he is still in far better shape than six months ago, when Mr. Bush was
                clobbering him by wide margins. Arguing that Mr. Gore was suffering in part because of expectations, he
                said: ''We came out of our primary higher than we should have. He came out of his primary lower than he

            <textdata>Already, the 2000 campaign has been remarkable for the many reversals of fortune. A year ago, Mr.
                Gore did not even view Mr. Bradley as a threat. By the fall, Mr. Bradley's success forced Mr. Gore to
                retool his campaign. And by the end of the primaries, Mr. Gore appeared to be more potent than Mr. Bush,
                who was severely wounded after a contentious scrimmage with Senator John McCain in which he made stark
                appeals to the right that many Democrats said would haunt him.

            <textdata>Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said his campaign was moving forward with a general
                election strategy that had long been in place but was interrupted by the primaries. He said the Gore
                campaign's drive to undermine Mr. Bush's experience would fail because voters ''recognize that Bush has
                crossed the threshold of experience.''

                the challenge for Gore is to get the race re-engaged as quickly as he can. We're in the best period for
                Bush. He's not forced to operate under pressure or in the heat of the battle. In those circumstances he
                delivers a plausible and often appealing performance. Gore is at his best in the heat of battle.''

            <textdata>Taking one of the biggest political risks of the presidential campaign so far, Mr. Bush proposed
                allowing individual workers to invest a part of their payroll taxes through private accounts. His plan
                would give workers an opportunity to capture some of the riches that Wall Street creates, but would also
                leave those workers to suffer the financial consequences if their timing or judgment is off.

            <textdata>Mr. Gore wants to maintain the guaranteed nature of the Social Security benefit, allowing it to
                remain a bulwark against poverty in old age. But through a somewhat complicated mechanism, Mr. Gore is

                heaving the problem onto the shoulders of taxpayers three decades from now.

                change in the nature of the system as well, the vice president has cast himself as the defender of a
                program that has proved to be perhaps the most popular and most effective of any administered in
                Washington.

            <textdata>Social Security faces a financial shortfall as the baby boom generation ages. Based on current
                estimates, the retirement system would spend its reserves by 2037, leaving it able to pay only 75
                percent of promised benefits after that point. To deal with that problem, Vice President Al Gore and
                Gov. George W. Bush are proposing different solutions.

            <textdata>Starting in 2011, Mr. Gore would begin transferring to Social Security an amount equal to the
                interest saved through reduction of the public debt. The amount would start at around $100 billion a
                year, and would grow to more than $200 billion a year by 2015. By doing so, Mr. Gore's plan would extend
                Social Security's solvency to 2050 without any cuts in benefits.

            <textdata>The money Mr. Gore would transfer into Social Security would not be cash, but instead i.o.u.'s
                that would have to be paid out of general tax revenues. In that way, Mr. Gore's plan would obligate
                taxpayers decades in the future to pay to keep the system afloat out of general revenues from income
                taxes -- a change from the current system under which Social Security is financed out of payroll taxes.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush's approach is built around the idea that the only alternative to cutting benefits or
                raising taxes is to increase the rate of return on the money going into the Social Security system. The
                best way to accomplish that goal, in his view, is to allow all workers to invest part of their payroll
                taxes in private accounts.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush has provided few details, saying that the specifics would have to be worked out in
                bipartisan negotiations. There are a variety of approaches to establishing individual investment
                accounts, and most would use about 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes to pay
                Social Security benefits.

            <textdata>Any investment plan that used 2 percentage points of the payroll tax would use about $1 trillion
                of the Social Security surplus over the next decade. That money would otherwise go to debt reduction, so
                Mr. Bush's plan would leave the nation with a larger debt than Mr. Gore's plan.

            <textdata>Historically, investing in the stock market has yielded a high rate of return, better than 7
                percent from 1926 through 1997, according to the Bush campaign. But there have been long periods when
                the market has been down, and not every investor has chosen the right stocks. Investing in safer
                alternatives, like bonds, reduces the rate of return along with the risk. And Democrats point out that
                most workers are already subject to considerable risk through 401(k)'s and other retirement accounts.

            <textdata>Shifting some of the payroll tax into individual retirement accounts would amount to the most
                far-reaching change in Social Security since its inception in the Depression. As Social Security has
                worked for decades, current retirees are paid from the payroll taxes of current workers; under the Bush
                plan, workers would be able to use a portion of their payroll taxes and invest them for their own

                what age group would see the change opened Mr. Bush to charges that he was masking some of the hard
                choices ahead and trying to sidestep questions about how he could afford the transition as well as his
                sweeping call for a $1.3 trillion tax cut in the next decade.

            <textdata>Supporters of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore feuded all day over which plan was more risky and which would
                entail more of a shift of general tax revenue into Social Security. Such a shift would require cuts in
                other programs or could lead to tax increases.

            <textdata>The vice president asserted that Mr. Bush's plan would make it nearly impossible to pay down the
                national debt. ''By leaving us with a multitrillion dollar debt for as far as the eye can see, the Bush
                plan could trigger higher interest rates and slower long-term growth,'' Mr. Gore said. ''That undermines
                our chance to meet other challenges, such as keeping Medicare solvent or providing an affordable
                prescription drug benefit for seniors.''

            <textdata>Mr. Gore has been lagging in recent polls and his advisers said privately they were pleased that
                Mr. Bush had taken on Social Security because it set up a clear policy difference between the candidates
                and provided a big target to shoot at, much like former Senator Bill Bradley's universal health care

                says, ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' But in the lifetime of some people in this room, it will be
                broke, and we must fix it. With every day of delay this becomes more difficult. For eight years, the
                Clinton-Gore administration has failed to act. And now Al Gore wants to pass the burden on to future
                generations. The Gore plan will eventually require either a 25 percent increase in income taxes, the
                largest in our history, or a substantial reduction in benefits. . . .

            <textdata>But in reality, the Bush Social Security privatization plan would weaken our national economy and
                undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum decent retirement. It would weaken our economy because it
                would make it impossible to pay down our national debt. It would cost about $1 trillion over 10 years to
                meet today's obligations through Social Security while allowing people to set up these individual
                accounts. And at the same time, Governor Bush is proposing a huge tax cut of nearly $2 trillion.

            <textdata>Despite Mr. Bush's advantages six months before Election Day, Mr. Gore may be heartened that vice
                presidents are often overshadowed by the presidents they serve until they can distinguish themselves on
                a national stage at their nominating convention. In fact, at this time 12 years ago, Mr. Bush's father,
                then the vice president, trailed Michael S. Dukakis by 10 points, but went on to a lopsided victory in
                November.

            <textdata>AL GORE, THE CARTOON -- Vice President Al Gore's aides may have finally found a way to overcome
                complaints about his being too stiff: animation. In the May 21 season finale of the Fox sci-fi comedy,
                ''Futurama,'' the real Mr. Gore provides the voice for a cartoon Al Gore in an episode titled, ''Back to
                the Present.'' In the show, the cartoon Mr. Gore leads a team of ''Action Rangers'' who help the
                bumbling Futurama regular, Fry, return to the 31st Century after he gets stranded in the 21st.

            <textdata>AL GORE, THE FATHER AND SON -- After wrapping up a campaign speech yesterday afternoon near
                Philadelphia, Vice President Al Gore flew on a half-empty Air Force II to Nashville, to pick up his
                mother, Pauline. The two were scheduled to fly to New York City today to see Mr. Gore's daughter,
                Karenna, graduate from Columbia Law School. Mr. Gore's aides said the flight to Nashville was paid for
                by taxpayers instead of by his campaign because it involved family business.

            <textdata>*Except for Jimmy Carter, every president for the last quarter-century has been left-handed. There
                is no question about Gerald R. Ford, George Bush or Bill Clinton. Ronald Reagan writes and eats with his
                right hand. But Edmund Morris, the Reagan biographer, has little doubt that Mr. Reagan is a natural
                lefty who is one of those who were trained to use their right hands. In the movies, Mr. Morris says, Mr.
                Reagan always twirled and shot pistols with his left hand, and as president, he always waved with his
                left hand. The presidential string is about to be broken. Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
                are both right-handed.

            <textdata>With many finance majors present at his Fordham event, Mr. Gore noted that he supported
                individuals investing in the stock market for retirement, provided no Social Security funds are
                involved. But to bolster his point that the markets can be risky, he brought along several experts,
                including Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street executive who was Treasury secretary until last year.

            <textdata>This question has suddenly become much more relevant, now that George W. Bush has announced his
                Social Security plan. He doesn't want the trust fund itself to buy stocks. But he does want to let
                workers put some of their contributions into individual retirement accounts, which could be invested in
                stocks. And he justifies this proposal by pointing to the high returns that stock market investors have
                historically earned, and comparing these returns with the ''dismal'' returns of the Social Security
                Administration. The higher returns people can get by investing in stocks will, he argues, let him scale
                back guaranteed benefits without reducing actual retirement income.

        <entry>
            <date>5-17-2000</date>
            <textdata>Economists who make this argument point to the same statistics cited by Mr. Bush: the fact that
                stocks have consistently yielded a much higher rate of return than bonds. Why this ''equity premium''
                persisted so long remains a puzzle: why didn't investors long ago rush into stocks, driving their prices
                up and their rate of return down? But anyway, the puzzle is now history: in the 1990's investors did
                rush into stocks. What the optimists believe is that this rush corrected an error rather than creating
                one, that the rise of the stock market in recent years reflects not the rise of irrational exuberance
                but the decline of irrational risk aversion.

            <date>5-17-2000</date>
            <textdata>I have my doubts about this story. But suppose that it is right, and that current stock valuations
                are in fact reasonable. Does this then validate Mr. Bush's plan? Alas, no. You see, those high returns
                cited by Mr. Bush -- the returns that are supposed to produce huge gains for workers free to make their
                own investment decisions -- are what stock investors got during an era in which people were very leery
                of stocks, and hence prices were low compared with earnings. Now that people are no longer so nervous,
                prices are much higher compared with earnings -- and the higher the price you pay for an asset, the
                lower the rate of return on your investment. (Duh.) So the rate of return on stock investments made now
                will probably be much lower than the returns people got in the past. (Remember, this is the optimistic
                scenario, which claims that current values are reasonable -- if they aren't, the return will be even
                lower.) And that means that the proposition that individual investors can expect to do a lot better than
                the Social Security Administration -- so much better that we can wave away concerns about increased risk
                -- evaporates.

            <textdata>So Mr. Bush can defend himself against the charge of bad timing by arguing that stocks are not
                overvalued, that their high prices are justified because people no longer demand traditionally high
                rates of return. But how can he then assume that people will nonetheless get those traditional high
                returns -- and use that assumption as the basis for a huge policy initiative?

                firmer in his opposition, even though there has been no new research in the intervening months to
                indicate that marijuana works better or worse than anyone thought in December.

            <textdata>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has reignited the debate over the future of Social Security and
                whether it is a good idea to allow individuals to invest some of their payroll taxes in the stock
                market.

            <textdata>Still, the announcement has signaled a change in the debate. Although Vice President Al Gore has
                attacked the idea as inherently risky, the concept of investing some money from payroll taxes in the
                stock market seemed to be more acceptable today than it was several years ago.

                the vice president, who is as broadly knowledgeable about foreign policy as anyone in the Democratic
                Party. They have not been canvassed for policy advice or speech drafts. Nor are they authorized to speak
                to the press on behalf of the Gore campaign. The list of their names was produced only after repeated
                requests from a reporter.

                administration, said Mr. Gore was reaching beyond the Beltway for fresh ideas. He said Mr. Gore depended

                policy guidance. Mr. Gore also consults regularly with Richard C. Holbrooke, the United Nations

                of the environment and free trade, he added.

                wholly on his own foreign policy ideas and those of Mr. Fuerth. Membership on the panel also gives
                foreign policy thinkers in the Democratic Party a stake in a victory by the vice president in November.

                important decisions with little outside advice. Mr. Gore did not draw on the advisory group in preparing
                his most recent address on foreign policy, delivered on May 1 in Boston, aides said. The vice president
                wrote much of the speech himself, with assistance from Mr. Fuerth and other members of the White House
                national security staff, they said. In the speech, Mr. Gore called for an activist foreign policy of
                ''forward engagement'' and criticized Mr. Bush for hewing to what he called an obsolete cold-war
                mentality.

                as surrogate speakers, drafting speeches and responding to press questions on national security matters.
                But they will never serve as the foreign policy ''brain'' of the Gore operation. That job is already
                taken, Mr. Fuerth said.

                yesterday, claiming him as an heir to the conservative political tradition of her husband, former

                build pride in America just as it did when my husband was president,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ''This is a
                candidate Ronnie would be proud of.'' Mr. Reagan, 89, has Alzheimer's disease and no longer makes public
                appearances or statements. Mrs. Reagan has offered her endorsement of every Republican presidential
                candidate since her husband left office in 1988. Mr. Bush proudly embraced the Reagan mantle. ''I thank
                her for her endorsement and pledge an optimistic, positive campaign, in the Reagan tradition, to renew
                America's spirit and encourage a new era of personal responsibility and freedom,'' Mr. Bush said.

                Microsoft denies it, many analysts say they think the company hopes a Republican administration will
                drop the breakup idea. The presumed G.O.P. nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has already suggested
                that he opposes a breakup of the company.

            <textdata>PITTING BROTHER AGAINST BROTHER -- Trying to foment a bit of sibling discord, the Gore campaign
                yesterday circulated a newspaper article by Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida that seemed to contradict a plan by
                his brother Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to allow taxpayers to invest some Social Security payroll taxes
                in the stock market. In an April 18 op-ed piece in The Tallahassee Democrat, Jeb Bush argued that,
                because of the stock market's volatility, the state pension system should put part of its $12 billion
                surplus in a fund that would be reserved for a downturn. ''It makes sense that we take the surplus we
                have now and place it in a reserve that is not affected by changes in the market,'' he wrote. Mr. Gore's
                aides said that suggested Mr. Bush wants to withdraw some pension funds from the stock market. A
                spokesman for Jeb Bush said the Gore campaign had misread the article.

            <textdata>SEEKING RUNNING-MATE SUGGESTIONS -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas sent letters to 450 Republicans
                yesterday seeking advice on a running mate. In the three-paragraph request, which went to United States
                senators, representatives, governors, state Republican committee members, state party chairmen and Bush
                for President committees, the governor said: ''My primary concern is to select someone who is capable of
                serving as president of the United States. I am interested in your thoughts as to individuals whom I
                should consider as well as any particular issues you believe I should take into account.'' Separately,
                in a Fox News television interview, Mr. Bush repeated that while he opposed abortion, he would accept a
                running mate who favored abortion rights -- within limits. Some leaders of the religious right have said
                Mr. Bush risks losing support should he pick a supporter of abortion rights.

                avoid the errors made in Bill Bradley's political advertising, which never adequately answered Mr.

                fuzzy images reminiscent of the upbeat advertisements for Ronald Reagan. The McKinnon style is more

                and on the air in 24 hours.

                sunny spots, Mr. Bush and his allies ran some of the harshest commercials of the primaries, including

                the most charming politician to come down the pike since Clinton. Mark does an excellent job of

                would not be coaxed into a meditation on any of Mr. Bush's perceived weaknesses. If it seemed a function

                long conversation with Mr. Bush in a chance encounter at a dinner in Austin in 1997. The year before,
                Mr. McKinnon confessed in a most public way -- a first-person article for Texas Monthly -- that after 15

                honest interest in education, an issue dear to Mr. McKinnon; he was making a documentary about the
                inspirational founder of a Houston charter school. ''I was amazed, blown away, by how much attention he
                paid,'' Mr. McKinnon said of the governor, and before long he had signed up to handle media in Mr.
                Bush's 1998 campaign for re-election as governor.

                another primary-election opponent, Steve Forbes, but it was Mr. McCain who surprised Mr. Bush with the
                harder hitting commercials, including one in New Hampshire in which Mr. McCain said Mr. Bush's tax cuts
                would mostly benefit the wealthy. Some of Mr. Bush's advisers believe that their failure to answer the
                commercial was a major factor in their sobering early loss in New Hampshire.

                of the primary season, Mr. Bush was able to turn Mr. McCain's clean-campaign vows against him. In an
                advertisement shot at a fishing camp in South Carolina, a serious-looking Mr. Bush responded to a McCain
                commercial in which the senator accused the governor of twisting the truth, ''like Clinton.''

            <textdata>Mr. Gore starts with the premise that the current system should be left more or less intact. His
                plan is built on the idea that there should be a way to use the current budget surplus to help Social

                makes executing it quite complicated.

                interest savings from debt reduction -- $100 billion a year at first, growing to more than $200 billion
                a year by 2015. Mr. Gore says the infusion would extend Social Security's solvency to 2054 from 2037

                knowledge or understanding, people don't take it seriously -- they sort of expect it -- yet when Mr.
                Gore makes a mistake (as with his interference in the case of Elian Gonzalez), he is castigated.

                Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Bush alike -- that could have terminated American military
                participation in Kosovo next July, it was mostly Democrats who ensured the provision's defeat.

            <textdata>Across other areas of foreign policy, where business is less of a factor, there have been a host
                of occasions over the past years in which Congress has declared independence from the president on
                foreign policy and shown a suspicion of mutlilateral engagements. Certainly the idea -- which Mr. Bush
                was trying to re-establish in his statement on Kosovo -- that Congress bows to the president on foreign
                policy has long disappeared.

                the time limit on funds for the deployment. Mr. Hagel had reached out last week to Mr. Bush's chief
                foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, to alert the Bush campaign of the implications of pending
                Kosovo vote and find out where Mr. Bush stood.

                he's our guy. And if our guy says it's okay to be in Kosovo, that makes somewhat of a difference.''

            <textdata>Moreover, Mr. Bush is more in sync with Republicans in Congress on a number of foreign policy
                issues. He is interested in building a robust antiballistic missile defense and like Mr. Helms has said
                he would rather leave it up to the next president, not Mr. Clinton, to negotiate with the Russians on
                the issue. He did not split with Senate Republicans when they voted down the test ban treaty last year.

                speech last year, he said that while America must be involved in the world, ''that does not mean our

                foreign policy experience, Mr. Gore added, ''One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's
                foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his
                party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership.''

            <textdata>My question is, if Governor Bush has accomplished little as Texas's chief executive, how is he
                qualified to serve as president of the United States? Basically, he is running without any track record.
                Perhaps if his name weren't Bush, he would just be one of the also-rans who took part in this year's
                Republican primaries.

                assistance -- from Philip Morris, AT&amp;T and the National Rifle Association, all three of which are
                among the most generous soft-money contributors to the party this year. The Democrats hope to raise a
                similar amount at a tribute to President Clinton later this month.

            <textdata>A GETAWAY FOR THE GORES -- Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, escaped Washington
                yesterday to spend their 30th wedding anniversary at Bethany Beach in Delaware. The Gores were staying
                at the beach home of Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's presidential campaign chairman, through Sunday. The couple
                took a Marine helicopter at taxpayer expense -- a requirement of the Secret Service, a spokesman said.
                Accompanying them were Mr. Gore's Secret Service detail, a military aide and a press aide, although the
                White House had not notified reporters of the vice president's travel until yesterday afternoon, after
                the Gores had left Washington. Mr. Gore last month had told reporters covering his presidential campaign
                that he would notify them when he traveled, including on his anniversary. ''I will err on the side of
                openness and full access as much as possible,'' he said. But he apparently had not shared this decision
                with his wife, who has said she hopes to maintain her family's privacy even if her husband becomes
                president and in a recent interview questioned why reporters would need to accompany the vice president

            <textdata>BUSH IN KENTUCKY -- Wending his way across Kentucky on a campaign bus, Gov. George W. Bush took
                his ''compassionate conservatism'' on the road yesterday, calling on the elderly to volunteer. At a
                center for the elderly in Paducah, Mr. Bush praised retired volunteers who share ''wisdom, experience
                and values'' as foster grandparents or mentors. He proposed to increase federal financing for such
                volunteer programs from $183 million a year to $240 million annually across five years. Some of the
                money would go to a pilot program, under which 10,000 low-income elderly volunteers would earn a $1,000
                scholarship for a grandchild or a child of their choice.

            <textdata>GORE WEB SITE ATTACKS BUSH PLAN -- Certain that Governor Bush has handed them the perfect campaign
                weapon with his Social Security proposal, the Gore campaign unveiled a new Web site this week devoted to
                attacking his plan. Its not-so-subtle address: www.bushinsecurity.com. The home page features a
                photograph of rolling dice (Mr. Gore likes to accuse Mr. Bush of promoting ''casino economics'') and a
                picture of a slightly crazed-looking Mr. Bush over the caption, ''When he was asked if people could lose
                money under his plan, Bush replied, 'Maybe, maybe not.'' Asked to respond to the Web site, Ari
                Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said, ''Having invented the Internet, you would have thought Al Gore
                could have used it for something positive and not just another attack barrage.'' He added that he would
                check the site to see whether it included a link to the White House Web site that promotes the Clinton
                administration's proposal to invest Social Security money in the stock market, an idea Mr. Gore once
                supported.

            <textdata>Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida is currently embroiled in a fight over an executive order that outlaws
                race-based admissions at the state universities -- while guaranteeing admissions to the top 20 percent
                of high school classes. Mr. Bush's order was meant to render moot a ballot initiative on affirmative
                action that Republicans feared would heighten black turnout in this year's presidential election. The 20
                percent rule seemed non-controversial and even generous -- until Governor Bush found that roughly
                two-thirds of additional black students who might benefit from the rule had been so neglected in high
                school that they had failed to graduate with the necessary credits for admission to the state university
                system. The state is now pushing public schools that serve black students to provide better course
                offerings.

            <textdata>MacArthur, the president and publisher of Harper's Magazine, is at his best describing the
                lobbying that occurred after the treaty was signed and went to Congress in August 1993. He shows how
                business lobbyists worked hand in glove with the treaty's Congressional supporters. But he has
                surprisingly little to say about the negotiations themselves, or about the domestic political conflicts
                that occurred while the treaty was being negotiated. His account of these tends to render shades of gray
                as black. When the Bush administration proposed that Congress agree to a fast-track vote (up or down
                without amendments), Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader and a Democrat, backed Bush on the
                condition that the treaty contain rules on labor standards and environmental protection. MacArthur
                dismisses this position as nave and opportunistic. (Gephardt ''was presumably ambitious to be liked by
                the sort of people, honest or not, who can make you president.'')

                to the point where there was no substantial difference between his position and Bush's.'' Clinton's
                stand, he says, was primarily based on fund-raising. That assertion leaves little middle ground between
                those adamantly opposed to Nafta and those enthusiastically in favor. MacArthur may be right, but when I
                covered the negotiations I found otherwise.

            <textdata>Others on the right hold more confused views. George W. Bush supports a constitutional amendment
                to ban abortion in most cases, and yet as governor of Texas he has personally signed the death warrants
                of more than 120 people -- about a sixth of all the condemned prisoners executed since capital
                punishment was revived in the 1970's. In an interview with Talk magazine last year, he even made fun of
                one of the victims of Texas' death row, Karla Fay Tucker, mocking her pleas for mercy. And despite
                growing DNA evidence of the innocence of many death-row convicts across the country, Bush has shown not
                even a glimmer of concern that the Texas judicial system might be flawed. Or take the vociferously
                anti-abortion representative Henry Hyde. Two years ago, Hyde said: ''I look for the common thread in
                slavery, the Holocaust and abortion. To me, the common thread is dehumanizing people.'' And yet Hyde has
                personally championed legislation that significantly curtails the judicial review of death-row appeals.
                Even Alan Keyes, that peerless defender of unborn life, turns out to be a supporter of criminals'
                deaths. He said earlier this year, ''I think that there are circumstances under which it is essential .
                . . that we have and apply the death penalty in order to send a clear moral message to people throughout
                our society that we will not tolerate that kind of disrespect for life.'' In other words, if you want to
                support life, enforce death.

                committee, but the campaign's complaint was dismissed last month by the Federal Election Commission.

            <textdata>And, as Mr. Simon points out, there was Fred Coe, the producer -- legendary within the television
                industry -- who nurtured writing talents like Paddy Chayefsky, Horton Foote and Gore Vidal. The
                teleplays they created were largely, he says, about ''contemporary life in the 50's.'' ''Marty,'' for
                instance, the 1953 television play written by Chayefsky, was not just about an unmarried young butcher
                with a possessive mother and no ideas for what to do on Saturday night, but about the transition from
                ''tradition to modern values,'' from prewar to postwar thinking. ''Fail Safe'' -- which starred Richard
                Dreyfuss, Brian Dennehy, Harvey Keitel and Noah Wyle -- was based on a 1964 movie and dealt with the
                cold war anxieties of the early 60's.

            <textdata>Many of the roots of Mr. Bush's political philosophy as a presidential candidate -- including his
                belief in tough love for juvenile offenders -- seem to go back to his childhood. Midland, a
                conservative, up-from-the-bootstraps town that has grown from 25,000 when he was a little boy to almost
                100,000 today, mirrors Mr. Bush's optimism, his faith in business and his doubts about an activist
                government. While playing Little League baseball, running for class president, or even sobbing in the
                principal's office, George W. Bush absorbed West Texas values that many old friends say are central to
                understanding who he is today.

            <textdata>Alongside the racism directed at blacks, there was a measured respect for the Mexicans who came

                nurturing environment. These days, as the son of a president and scion of a wealthy family, he is often

                town of Odessa, where they shared a bathroom with a mother-daughter team of prostitutes living next

                painted bright colors to make them seem different. It was called Easter Egg Row, because the houses

                famous family, and Al Gore as more of his own man. But in the 1950's and early 1960's, it was the other
                way around. Back then, the name George Bush belonged only to an obscure Texas businessman. George W.'s
                closest connection to the White House was that he was a descendant on his mother's side of Franklin
                Pierce, America's 14th president. In contrast, in those days ''Albert Gore'' was virtually a household
                name, belonging to a prominent senator (the present candidate's father and namesake) who was sometimes
                mentioned as presidential or vice-presidential timber. The senator lost his seat in 1970 and faded into
                obscurity.

                to see the White House, the United States Capitol and a baseball game with the Washington Senators
                (whose later incarnation would move to Texas and become the Rangers, owned in part by George W. Bush).

                their hair grow a bit longer, but -- like George W. Bush -- they mostly stood with the establishment
                instead of rejecting it. Very few seem to have protested significantly against the Vietnam War,
                seriously used drugs, thought of police as ''pigs,'' denounced their parents as oppressors or picked up
                a copy of Das Kapital.

            <textdata>''It's a town of embedded values,'' Mr. Bush recalled, adding that it had ''a heavy dose of
                individualism and fairly healthy disrespect for government.'' Asked if his own skepticism about the role
                for government is a product of Midland attitudes, Mr. Bush paused and finally nodded, saying: ''I think
                there's a parallel there, I do.''

            <textdata>Midland was steeped in optimism, and for many people growing up here in the 1950's, the moral of
                childhood was that the system worked, that anyone who struggled enough in that baking desert had a good
                chance of finding oil and striking it rich. The trajectory of the Bush family itself, from the apartment
                with the shared bathroom to the sprawling house and pool, underscored the point.

                is not so much about whether Al Gore or George W. Bush makes it to the White House. It's about whom Mr.
                Gore or Mr. Bush would put on the Supreme Court, where vacancies are likely, if not in the next four
                years, then certainly in the next president's potential second term. Three of the nine justices are age

                emboldened last week when the court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, overturned parts of the Violence Against Women
                Act, in a rebuke to Congress's efforts to use interstate commerce rules to preempt state powers. That
                ruling, they said, would galvanize women who feel they have been left more vulnerable to
                gender-motivated violence.

                announced a plan for reforming the federal retirement-benefits system that would allow workers to invest

                His slogan, designed to appeal to disaffected whites supporting George Wallace, was ''Bill Brock

            <textdata>Born poor in the remote settlement of Possum Hollow, Tenn., Mr. Gore lived through the worst of
                the Depression and spent seven years working his way through college by teaching in a one-room school --
                he would spend one year earning money, then the next year spending it on his studies.

            <textdata>That perception has clearly become a political problem for the vice president. Gov. George W. Bush
                of Texas regularly suggests that Mr. Gore is a natural-born phony, and the vice president's every remark
                is now fact-checked so scrupulously that when he recently said he had once dreamed of becoming a
                teacher, reporters wondered if he could prove it. Had anyone ever heard that story before?

            <textdata>But in separating the facts from the fanciful in Mr. Gore's life, perhaps the most striking
                discovery is the extent to which the material that is the most widely doubted is also the most
                demonstrably true: Al Gore did do a lot of his growing up in Tennessee. He did work hard on the farm
                there -- so hard, in fact, that the hired help felt sorry for him, and thought his father should ease
                up.

            <textdata>Part of the reason that the contours of Mr. Gore's unusual upbringing are not better known,
                however, is that he himself has worked so hard to discredit a lot of authentic stories about his
                childhood -- the very stories, in fact, that would probably do him the most good politically. The
                problem, for him, is the scenes from the past that portray Mr. Gore sympathetically at the expense of
                his hard-driving parents. They suggest an emotionally neglected boy forced to bear the weight of
                enormous adult expectations, and Mr. Gore, who is fiercely protective of his 87-year-old mother and the
                memory of his father, categorically balks at that.

            <textdata>For a time, a decade ago, after his unsuccessful 1988 presidential campaign and his son's
                near-fatal car accident the next year, Mr. Gore himself seemed determined to explore the meaning of his
                own life story. He made a serious study of family dysfunction -- the subtext of his 1992 environmental
                manifesto, ''Earth in the Balance'' -- and passed out copies of Alice Miller's ''Drama of the Gifted
                Child,'' a book about how narcissistic parents can leave their high-achieving children cut off from
                their own feelings and hazy on just what they want, other than to make Mom and Dad proud. Back then,
                friends said, he was absorbed by the need to figure things out, to emerge from his father's shadow. To
                decide.

            <textdata>But today, Mr. Gore seems nothing if not decided. He does want to be president, and if he can
                never really know exactly how much of that want began with his parents, his current attitude seems to
                be: So what? ''One of the oldest plots in the human story is child follows parent,'' he said recently,
                with what sure seemed like authentic boredom. And looking back on his early years did not seem so very
                difficult.

            <textdata>In a series of interviews about his life, he was relaxed and appeared at peace with the past. He
                frankly described a childhood in which even the usual juvenile scrapes might become part of continuing
                political calculations -- maybe the same way writers often end up milking their families for material.
                When he got in trouble for throwing whitewash on trucks as they passed the Gore farm when he was 12, for
                example, his father made him send letters of apology to a number of trucking companies. ''That was also
                an election year, I believe,'' he remarked wryly. But, he made clear, it was also just a kid's life.

            <textdata>His real childhood was in Tennessee; in Washington, he spent his time with adults -- important
                adults, in whose presence he was expected to behave beautifully, and did. Tennessee was, at the very

                dullness, a loneliness about it. He didn't lay around Washington much when he could have been in
                Carthage, and that's where he got his values, working on the farm and growing up around Smith County

            <textdata>Of course, Mr. Gore is the product of both Washington and Tennessee -- and of the very fact of
                having grown up in two places, with two groups of friends and two ways of looking at the world. He was
                born in Washington, lived in Tennessee from the time he was 1 until he was 4, while his father ran for
                the Senate, and then moved between the two places until college.

            <textdata>And he and his wife thought that working on the farm would be good for their son, whom they told
                friends they hoped would be president one day. ''It was expected from the time he was little,'' said
                James Fleming, a Nashville doctor and friend of Nancy Gore's, who for a time served as the Gore family
                physician. It was not so much that the Gores thought cleaning out barns would add just the right touch
                of ''log cabin'' to his resume, family friends said, as that they simply felt it would toughen him up
                and give him a proper work ethic.

                to have some unscripted fun. Mr. Thompson remembers his friend as ''pranky,'' with a love of practical
                jokes that endures today.

            <textdata>One New Year's Eve, several of his friends said, their whole group was snowed in at the Gore farm,
                so Pauline Gore corralled all the girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boys in Al's room on the lower
                level. The senator, dressed in his bathrobe, sat sentry duty at the top of the stairs all night long,
                and every so often yelled downstairs to his son and the other boys, who were busy sharing one bottle of
                beer.

                while staying with the Thompsons, he heard that his father, who was away, was going to be giving a
                speech in Nashville, 55 miles east. His parents, though, had decided that their son should not come to

                he got to be a kid in Tennessee -- skinny-dipping with Mr. Thompson in a cattle trough or hypnotizing
                chickens, which Mr. Gore says is ''a little-known farm skill passed down from adolescent wizard to

                Cordell Hull, whom he describes as ''the model for public service in our part of the country.'' Mr. Hull
                floated logs down the Cumberland River with Mr. Gore's grandfather, settled in Carthage and became the
                congressman in the seat the Gore father and son later held.

            <textdata>For him, the best times were those spent throwing a ball around with his father at Grady Gore's
                estate in Potomac, Md. ''He had some cattle from the Tennessee farm brought up there,'' Mr. Gore said,
                smirking like he knows that sounds kind of crazy. ''And a lot of times on weekends we'd go up there and
                he'd work with the cattle and I'd help him and then we'd take a break.'' Sometimes, too, they played
                catch in the Russell building, outside the senator's office, though if someone walked by, ''he'd duck
                back into the office until they passed'' because ''it wasn't very dignified,'' the son recalled. When Al
                Gore had real ballgames, though, it was his sister, not his father, who would come.

            <textdata>More often, his father took him to Senate hearings. He sat through long stretches of discussion
                over the bill, co-sponsored by his father, that created the Interstate System of highways. How wide
                would the new roads be? Green or blue for the road signs? As a kid, Mr. Gore followed these developments
                avidly, keeping track of the miles of completed highway the way other kids his age followed the Yankees'
                box scores.

                have suggested? ''Mmmmm, my dad was pretty liberal,'' Mr. Gore answered. ''She was, like most moms, the
                conscience of the family, but they didn't really disagree. And my sister was more liberal than both of
                them put together.''

            <textdata>Little more than a year ago, Mr. Bush came under criticism for silence on the West's air war in
                Kosovo. And more than a few critics have questioned how capable he would be, as president, on foreign
                policy issues. In the Republican primaries, his main opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona,
                repeatedly said that he himself would not need ''on-the-job training,'' a way of belittling Mr. Bush's
                credentials to be commander in chief.

            <textdata>In recent days, Mr. Bush has been raising his profile on international affairs. Last week he took
                positions on pending Congressional disputes on financing for Kosovo peace-keeping and on trade with
                China.

            <textdata>Bush Backs Arms Cuts And Antimissile System Gov. George W. Bush, flanked by prominent figures from
                four Republican administrations, called for a ''new approach to nuclear security,'' one that includes
                possible unilateral reductions in American nuclear weapons combined with a robust antimissile defense
                system. Mr. Bush said he wanted to reduce the size of America's nuclear arsenal to the ''lowest possible
                number consistent with our national security'' and below the levels called for under the START II treaty
                with Russia.

                previous policy speeches, his audience consisted only of several dozen Washington reporters gathered in
                the National Press Club. His speech was relatively short, and much of his time was devoted to answering
                questions.

                Rumsfeld, several of whom voiced support of Mr. Bush's ideas. The result was some strange political
                symbolism as Mr. Bush called for new thinking for a new post-cold-war era, surrounded by some of the
                architects of the nation's cold-war arms control treaties.

            <textdata>Although President Clinton has signaled his willingness to negotiate further weapons cuts with
                Russia, Mr. Bush accused the administration of being ''locked in a cold-war mentality'' on arms control.
                That was virtually the same charge Vice President Al Gore used against Mr. Bush just a few weeks ago. At
                that time Mr. Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said Mr. Bush was ''stuck in a
                cold-war mind-set'' and cited his advocacy of a global missile defense system.

            <textdata>Today, Mr. Gore's aides sharply criticized Mr. Bush, saying his approach to nuclear security was
                unrealistic, that it would not be accepted by the Russians and that it would would undermine years of

                defense secretary to conduct an assessment of the nuclear force structure and only then decide how many
                nuclear weapons the nation needed.

                nuclear arsenal below those levels, though their words were not aimed at Mr. Bush. They appeared at a
                hearing called by Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, as a pre-emptive strike against any
                efforts by the administration to use lower nuclear arms cuts with Russia to win agreement on limited
                missile defense system.

                just the United States but its allies against accidental missile launchings, terrorist strikes or rogue
                nations. He said that he would share the technology with Europe and Israel and that he might consider

                things for which he has called: a $1.3 trillion tax cut and billions of new dollars in spending on
                social programs and additional tax incentives. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that
                it would cost $60 billion to build a land-based system that would include 250 missile interceptors at
                two sites.

                the Persian gulf war of 1991 and who many Republicans would like to see as a vice-presidential
                candidate. Mr. Powell has said he is not interested in the job. ''The answer's well known,'' he said

                records, and the environment is an issue on which Democrats believe Mr. Bush is highly vulnerable; Vice
                President Al Gore regularly decries Mr. Bush's stewardship of a state that ranks in several categories
                as one of the nation's most polluted. Texas's vast and influential oil and chemical industries have
                yielded the state riches but also some pollution problems. Houston is among the nation's most smoggy

                quotes from federal reports that describe Texas's environmental flaws, Mr. Bush can cite some

                begun by his predecessor, Ann W. Richards, a Democrat, to reward companies that cut their toxic waste by

            <textdata>GORE LEADS IN HOLLYWOOD MONEY -- Entertainment industry donors, historically more Democratic than
                Republican, give Vice President Al Gore more campaign money than they give Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
                Through March 30 in the current election cycle, Mr. Gore collected $858,865 from executives and others
                employed by television, movie and music companies, while Mr. Bush brought in $661,877, according to the
                latest figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan study group in Washington.
                Over all, Mr. Bush has a 2-to-1 lead in fund-raising, $84 million to $36 million, not including federal
                matching funds. The entertainment industry is Mr. Gore's fifth-largest campaign contributor; it is No.
                20 on the Bush list.

                retirement age to finance it. Mr. Bush denies that.

            <textdata>The president of the United Auto Workers today offered one of the most blistering assessments of
                Mr. Gore's actions on behalf of the bill. Mr. Gore has been two-faced, the union president said, and is
                driving the auto workers into the arms of one of the auto industry's enduring nemesis, Ralph Nader, who
                is also running for president.

                defend to the death the right to bear arms drew a chuckle yesterday from Vice President Al Gore, the
                association's top political target. Mr. Gore said Mr. Heston and other association officials were dead
                wrong when they said last week at the association's annual convention in Charlotte, N.C., that he wanted
                to disarm America. Alluding to the moment at the convention when the Mr. Heston raised a flintlock
                musket over his head and pledged to die defending his constitutional right to have it, Mr. Gore said in
                an interview with National Public Radio: ''I have no intentions of proposing or supporting policies or
                allowing policies that would disarm America. What I have proposed that has upset him so much is a set of
                common-sense restrictions on the availability of handguns.'' Referring to defending his right to bear
                arms to the death, Mr. Heston said, ''So as we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that
                would take freedom away, I want to say those fighting words, for everyone within the sound of my voice
                to hear and to heed, and especially you, Mr. Gore.'' When Mr. Heston's comment with musket raised was
                read to Mr. Gore yesterday, he chuckled.

            <textdata>George W. Bush and a phalanx of famed cold warriors brought it off this week. They denounced the
                arms-control doves seeking to curry favor with Vladimir Putin at the forthcoming Moscow summit meeting
                as -- hold your breath -- a pack of unreconstructed cold-war relics.

            <textdata>That effectively exposed the Putin-Clinton dealing on ABM and Start III as a meaningless charade.
                But it posed a political appearance problem for the Bush campaign. How to oppose the summit stunt
                without seeming to be obstructionist, triumphalist, nasty to the Russians or, worst of all, subject to
                accusations of being an unreconstructed cold warrior?

            <textdata>But this performance by the Bush front-line brain trust was played with a remarkable rhetorical
                twist. Instead of hunkering down to await the usual ''unreconstructed cold warriors'' blast from the
                White House, Bush charged the Clinton-Gore administration with being ''locked in a cold-war mentality.''

            <textdata>That stole the opposition's clothes. Calling for ''a new era of nuclear security,'' Bush
                announced: ''The cold-war era is history. Our nation must recognize new threats, not fixate on old
                ones.'' He anticipated a knee-jerk Gore reaction with a built-in response: ''It is possible to build a
                missile defense and defuse confrontation with Russia. America should do both.''

            <textdata>He then showed arms-control sophisticates he had an understanding of the potential Putin-Clinton
                summit dodge: ''Start III should not be an excuse to limit our ability to build a missile defense
                system.'' Rather than let a Russian deal on amending ABM determine the number of missiles in our
                arsenal, the U.S. military would determine how few are required for our security; Bush would then ask
                Russia to match the cuts.

                investment in the stock market to undermine the vice president's assertions that Social Security

                create a risk that the government might be making a bad investment. During long stretches -- including
                from the late 1960's to the early 1980's, Wall Street was by no means the one-way bet it has often been
                viewed as in recent years.

                when he first was elected to Congress in 1976 to avoid any conflicts of interest, not out of fear of
                risk, and that he supported a variety of proposals to promote savings and investment.

                replacement for it. And he said that Mr. Bush's economic policies, including his big tax cut and his
                need to use much of the Social Security surplus to pay for the creation of private accounts, would
                undermine the fiscal discipline that has helped propel the markets upward in recent years.

            <textdata>Nor are presidential candidates barred from developing their own foreign policy ideas. On the

                continuity, most obviously by appearing at a news conference on Tuesday with Henry Kissinger and Colin
                Powell, two Republicans who are respected by Democrats. Unlike Congressional Republicans, Mr. Bush seems
                to recognize the distinction between principled opposition and vengeful obstructionism, and to know how
                destructive the latter can be.

            <textdata>Despite differences with their predecessors, each achieved triumphs by staying the course of a
                bipartisan foreign policy. And each had legislative help. If Mr. Bush is elected, he will need it, too.
                But he also needs it now if the country is to feel confident in Republican leadership. He needs an
                Arthur Vandenberg. Sadly, he doesn't appear to be in sight.

            <textdata>With the system in need of more revenue, not less, diverting part of the payroll tax into private
                accounts, as Mr. Bush proposes, appears irresponsible, unless, of course, you make up the difference by
                cutting benefits. Without such cuts, privatization would dig the financing hole even deeper, which is
                why thoughtful privatization proposals generally include significant tax increases to make good on
                promises that have already been made. But Mr. Bush has not proposed any. This is no minor omission.
                Diverting 2 percentage points of the payroll tax into individual accounts would drain trillions of
                dollars from Social Security over the next quarter-century.

            <textdata>The Bush plan not only would imperil Social Security's finances, but would add new elements of
                cost and risk to the retirement security of millions of Americans. Privatization is superficially
                attractive for two main reasons: the higher returns that can presumably be earned, say, in the stock
                market, and the virtues of individual choice. That's all well and good for financially sophisticated
                Americans, who happen (by no coincidence) also to enjoy every other advantage in our society, and who,
                by the way, do not rely heavily on Social Security for their retirement income. But what about the less
                fortunate citizens, the ones who will need to live on their Social Security checks but who may not know
                the difference between a stock and a bond?

            <textdata>Finally, let's remember the central idea behind the Social Security system: to provide social
                insurance. Both words matter. High-wage earners like me would undoubtedly be better off under the Bush
                proposal, and even better off under full privatization. After all, universal social insurance forces us
                to remain in the same pool with, and partially subsidize, those who are less fortunate. Social
                Security's benefit formula offers a better rate of return to lower-wage individuals.

                and diminish the threat of an accidental or intentional nuclear conflict. America's security will be
                best protected if the next president moves boldly to cut nuclear arms without suddenly overturning the
                carefully calibrated balance between offensive and defensive weapons that has long been central to

            <textdata>It seems fitting that the first presidential campaign of the new century should confront the most
                dangerous military legacy of the last century, nuclear arms. Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al
                Gore initiated an important and healthy debate in recent days about how best to reduce nuclear arsenals
                and diminish the threat of an accidental or intentional nuclear conflict. America's security will be
                best protected if the next president moves boldly to cut nuclear arms without suddenly overturning the
                carefully calibrated balance between offensive and defensive weapons that has long been central to
                preserving the peace.

            <textdata>But there are disabling problems with Mr. Bush's desire to make an antimissile shield a
                centerpiece of his nuclear strategy. For one thing, the technology to destroy even a handful of incoming
                warheads in outer space remains elusive. Intercepting just one warhead has proved difficult in recent
                tests. For another, an abrupt shift to defensive strategies would invite Moscow to increase its nuclear
                arsenal to ensure that it could overwhelm even a limited American antimissile system.

            <textdata>But that is just the risk that Mr. Bush takes by emphasizing the immediate development of a robust
                antimissile defense. Apart from questions of cost and technology -- the United States has already wasted
                billions of dollars chasing this goal -- Mr. Bush's approach will tempt Washington to break out of the
                1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The pact limits the defensive systems that Washington and Moscow can
                construct. An American breakout would unravel the arms control work of six presidents, and encourage
                China to join a new arms race to overcome the shield.

            <textdata>Even Mr. Bush's own arms reduction proposals would be threatened. Many of the ideas he presented
                this week were constructive and creative. Mr. Bush made clear his commitment to seek deeper cuts than
                those provided under the last arms reduction treaty. The 1993 agreement requires Washington and Moscow
                to slash the number of long-range warheads from roughly 6,000 on each side to half that count. Mr. Bush
                seemed comfortable with eventually leaving each country with 2,000 to 2,500 long-range weapons. Drawing
                on the positive example his father set as president, Mr. Bush also said he would consider eliminating
                some American missiles and lowering the alert status of others on his own to encourage Moscow to respond
                in kind.

            <textdata>Years later, arms control is suddenly back at center stage in a presidential campaign that was
                expected to focus on domestic policy. And some of those same advisers who pushed Mr. Reagan away from
                his radical views on arms control are now advising Governor Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, as
                he gives new voice to the idea of large cuts in offensive weapons, coupled with construction of missile
                defenses, and places it squarely on the current political agenda.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush and his advisers argue that it is long past time for a radical reassessment of nuclear
                armaments. The idea of holding populations hostage to annihilation is worse than immoral, they say; it
                is irrelevant. They complain that President Clinton has wasted much of the decade since the end of the
                cold war by clinging to the orthodoxy of using the specter of ''mutual assured destruction'' to deter
                any nuclear power from contemplating a first strike.

                shield the United States from nuclear warheads, said his thinking has evolved on such defenses because
                of the rapid advance of technology. He said Mr. Bush knows that current technology cannot produce an
                impermeable nuclear shield any time soon. But, he added, ''it's not too much to say there is a
                reasonable prospect to interpose a thin layer of defense.''

            <textdata>What's more, Mr. Bush is discussing the possibility of making such reductions unilaterally, rather
                than through years of negotiations with Russia or China over accuracy, throw-weights, basing modes,

            <textdata>Mr. Bush said he envisions a sweeping review of strategic needs by the Pentagon that will help
                establish the optimal size of the nuclear force. He will then challenge Russia to match American
                reductions in weaponry. His chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, calls these ''reciprocal
                unilateral measures'' and describes them as a simpler and less time-consuming way to do arms control
                than the interminable talks that have dominated arms control efforts with Moscow.

            <textdata>As another Bush adviser put it: ''The governor said he was going to figure out what we need,
                reduce to that level, and encourage the Russians to do the same. We're not going to build stuff we don't
                need just because Russians have stuff they don't need.''

            <textdata>Vice President Al Gore had hoped that such questions would not become central to the presidential
                campaign this year. He and other administration officials felt they had neutralized much of the
                Republican fervor for a robust missile shield by moving toward a decision this year on a limited system
                of land-based national missile defense.

            <textdata>Speaking to a Roman Catholic group, Gov. George W. Bush today took the side of the Vatican in a
                battle over its status at the United Nations, a clash that stems in large part from its stands in
                international disputes over family planning and abortion.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush, criticized during the Republican primary campaign for appearing at Bob Jones University,
                whose leaders have expressed anti-Catholic views, brought up the effort by a number of groups, many of
                them women's and health organizations that disagree with the church on abortion and family planning, to
                downgrade the Vatican's permanent-observer status.

            <textdata>''In world affairs, the Holy See has long been an influence for the good, and never more than in
                the last couple of decades,'' said Mr. Bush, speaking by satellite hookup to the Catholic Press
                Association, which was meeting in Baltimore.

                delegate to the United Nations, said Mr. Gore and the Clinton administration backed the Vatican's
                permanent-observer status as well.

                remarks sprinkled with quotations from both Pope John Paul II and Cardinal John O'Connor, the late
                archbishop of New York. ''A truly welcoming society must be a culture of life,'' the governor said,
                calling for the ''day when every child, born and unborn, is welcome in life and protected in law.''

            <textdata>In response to a question, Mr. Bush defended Texas' record on executions, saying capital
                punishment, more common here than in any other state, ''sends a chilling message'' that deters crime. He
                said once again that he knew of no one innocent whom the state had executed.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush's aides said his comments today about the Clinton administration's position on the matter
                had been prompted by the United States mission's sponsoring a news conference in March by Catholics for
                Free Choice, a group seeking a review of the Vatican's status. A non-government organization, or N.G.O.,
                has to be sponsored by a member nation in order to hold a news conference at the United Nations.

                administration would not have given Catholics for Free Choice access to the United Nations. But this
                aide spoke on the condition that he not be identified. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the campaign, was
                less definitive, saying that if a Bush administration sponsored such a group, Mr. Bush ''would make
                clear he didn't share their point of view.''

                Senator John McCain, who was Mr. Bush's main rival for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Bush
                later wrote to Cardinal O'Connor to say he regretted not having used his appearance at Bob Jones to
                speak out against its leaders' views.

                with his failure to win a single state and dismayed with Mr. Gore's brass-knuckle campaign, Mr. Bradley
                disappeared from public view after bowing out of the race on March 9. And Mr. Gore has made little

            <textdata>Aides to Mr. Bradley say talks between the two camps have been reasonably smooth. But some friends
                of his contend that the Gore campaign should have acted sooner to unify the party and recruit his help.
                They say one reason Mr. Bradley has kept a low profile is that Mr. Gore has not called him personally to
                request his support. ''They've obviously made a calculation that they don't need Bradley's help,'' said
                one Democratic member of Congress who supported the Bradley campaign.

                he said, was clearly shown to have made an innocent mistake and had corrected it quickly. The questions
                about Mr. Gore involve whether the vice president was telling the truth when he asserted he was unaware
                that his fund-raising efforts were aimed at raising money that is both limited and regulated by federal
                law.

                involvement of parents in their children's lives. The level of detail into which he becomes engrossed
                was evident in his response to a question about the behavior of children on school buses.

                about $300 on the open market. The subsidy dated to the 1950's, when the United States Forest Service
                agreed to provide a steady supply of timber at low prices to two companies that agreed to build pulp
                mills in the area.

                nervous.

            <textdata>That Vice President Al Gore has assumed a more passive posture in articulating his agenda has not
                been lost on his own party. And some of his supporters, with an eye on Mr. Bush's rising poll numbers,
                began expressing their anxieties publicly.

            <textdata>State Democratic leaders, meanwhile, descended on Nashville to plan and make their own declaration
                of solidarity. Some 72 party leaders from around the country met with Mr. Gore on Thursday, and
                afterward several remarked that it was not only too early to worry about the polls, but also that Mr.
                Bush will not seem such a fresh face in time.

            <textdata>Still, he's getting the brush. In the latest New York Times poll, George W. Bush has a wide lead
                with men and, amazingly, edges out Mr. Gore with women (who elected Bill Clinton), 44 to 42 percent.
                Even feminists are nagging Mr. Gore about his lack of oomph.

                policy address that Mr. Bush delivered in Washington on Tuesday. Again and again, Mr. Gore assailed the
                notion of one-sided arms reductions, a prospect that Mr. Bush had raised at an appearance with a cast of
                well-known Republican foreign policy leaders.

                be so upset about the China bill that they will sit out the November elections, a development that could
                hurt Mr. Gore worst in the industrial swing states of the Midwest.

            <textdata>In contrast, Mr. Sweeney is pushing unions to back Mr. Gore and most Democratic House candidates
                because in his view they are more likely to back labor on issues like Social Security and the minimum
                wage than are the Republicans.

                hurt his party this fall. ''Obviously members of labor disagree with the vice president and some members

                better served by making sure that Al Gore is the next president.''

                is much more expensive than it used to be, they just repeat the mantra that stocks have historically
                been a great investment. In other words, that $100 bill was there yesterday, so it must still be there,

            <textdata>In a May 15 speech he asked his listeners to ''consider this simple fact: even if a worker chose
                only the safest investment in the world, an inflation-adjusted U.S. government bond, he or she would
                receive twice the rate of return of Social Security.'' That's an amazing fact; it's even more amazing
                when you realize that the Social Security system invests all its money in, you guessed it, U.S.
                government bonds. But the explanation -- which Mr. Bush's advisers understand very well, even if the
                governor does not -- is that today's workers are not only paying for their own retirement, but also
                supporting today's retirees. And if you think that's a minor detail -- that the question of how to meet
                existing obligations when workers are allowed to invest their contributions elsewhere is a side issue --
                let me assure you that I too would have no trouble devising a painless plan to save Social Security, if
                you let me assume that a large part of the system's obligations would magically disappear.

                race proceeds at a torrid clip, without shame or remorse in either political party. As of last week, the
                two parties had raised at least $200 million in soft money, a record for this point in the election
                cycle, and they are well on their way to doubling the $260 million in soft money raised in 1996.
                Meanwhile, individual contributions are reaching nosebleed altitudes when some dinner guests fork over

                president he would bring ''meaningful'' change. But neither he nor Mr. Clinton seemed the least bit

            <textdata>One proposed remedy for financial imbalance is partial privatization, the approach favored by
                Governor Bush. Under current law, workers and employers pay a 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes into a
                public trust fund. Under partial privatization, workers could divert, say, two percentage points of that
                tax to private accounts that the worker could then invest in stocks and bonds. Workers would collect
                less money from the trust fund when they retired, alleviating financial strain on the system. But they
                would expect to more than make up for the loss by drawing from their private accounts.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush cites as an advantage that private accounts can be invested in stocks whereas the trust
                fund by law cannot. But if the law were changed to let the trust fund itself purchase stocks, as
                President Clinton has proposed, it could invest in the markets far more cheaply than could private
                accounts. The cost of administering 150 million individual private accounts would be huge, eating away
                20 percent or more of worker deposits. Private accounts could also subject individuals, including the
                poor, to unacceptable investment risk at the most vulnerable time in their lives. Worse, they undermine
                the principle of social insurance, setting individuals off to fend for themselves without looking out
                for the needy.

                proposing new benefits for stay-at-home mothers and for widows and widowers, thereby increasing the

                entire country mobilized, body and soul, to fight an enemy. The First and Second World Wars were, to
                most Americans, unambiguously noble, and so in its goals of eliminating slavery and saving the union was
                the Civil War. But since then our conflicts have become less clear-cut -- most famously Vietnam, but
                also to some extent Korea and even Mr. Bush's Desert Storm.

            <textdata>Mr. Cohen extended the invitation after Mr. Bush proposed last week to consider making unilateral
                reductions in nuclear weapons, possibly deeper than those now being negotiated between the United States
                and Russia. Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also pledged to construct a far
                larger antiballistic missile defense than the one now contemplated by the Clinton administration.

                ''internal inconsistencies.'' Building a larger missile defense than the administration's limited one,

                nuclear arsenals, making negotiated reductions far less likely.

                president-elect to receive high-level national security briefings as part of the transition to the White

                automatically. Instead, he said he would consider reductions based on recommendations by the Pentagon's

                Capitol Hill and said they would oppose reducing the number of warheads below the 2,000 to 2,500 being

                drug treatment in federal prisons had declined during the Clinton-Gore administration, even as drug use

                quieter sound was what his predecessor in the band, Buck Clayton, had adopted, and it was what the

                Watergate scandals, and the legislation before Congress would simply extend those limits to donations to
                parties, which have been used to undermine the old reforms.

                one of its greatest assets.

            <textdata>The figures released by Bush aides today addressed a weakness in earlier calculations. With the
                annual spending battle stepping up on Capitol Hill, the Bush campaign stopped assuming Congress would
                make large reductions in domestic spending, instead assuming discretionary domestic spending would grow.

            <textdata>At the same time, Mr. Bush's advisers argued that the growth in the economy over the past six
                months means the federal surplus will be larger than previously forecast. They said that under their new
                calculations the estimated federal surplus across 10 years -- after $2.2 trillion is set aside for
                Social Security -- will amount to $1.8 trillion.

            <textdata>The most serious dispute between the two campaigns is the true cost of Mr. Bush's tax-cut
                proposal. Mr. Bush's aides said the tax cut would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years from 2001-2010. Over
                just five years they said it would cost $460 billion, slightly less than their original estimate of $483
                billion. And they pointed to an analysis from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation backing
                them. The committee is controlled by Republicans.

        <entry>
            <date>5-3-2000</date>
            <textdata>The Gore campaign argued that it was more appropriate to examine the tax cut through 2011, since
                the tax cut does not go into effect until fiscal 2002. Mr. Gore's aides said that once that extra year
                is added in, as well as lost interest costs, the tax cut costs $2 trillion.

            <textdata>Another looming battle is over debt reduction and Social Security. Mr. Gore has made eliminating
                the public debt the centerpiece of his economic agenda. He says that Mr. Bush's proposal for putting
                some Social Security money into individual retirement accounts will carry a huge cost because it will
                require using part of the federal surplus that would otherwise go toward eliminating the national debt.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush's aides counter that by giving individual workers their own retirement accounts, which
                can be invested in financial markets, they decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay
                benefits out of tax revenues. This itself, they say, is a form of debt reduction.

            <textdata>GOV. THOMPSON NAMED PLATFORM CHAIRMAN Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin has been named chairman
                of the committee that will draft the Republican platform at the party's national convention this summer,
                an appointment that abortion rights advocates regard as a sign that George W. Bush, the presumed
                presidential nominee, will not ease the party's staunch anti-abortion position. Two years ago, Governor
                Thompson signed legislation outlawing the procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Kate
                Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said the selection showed that Mr.
                Bush, despite his advocacy of inclusiveness, ''cares about what the far right of his party wants.'' Mr.
                Thompson said after his appointment on Monday that he looked forward to ''serving on the committee to
                articulate our party's most innovative ideas, the principles that bind us together and our vision for
                the future.''

            <textdata>BUSH HOLDS NARROW LEAD The latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup presidential preference poll gives Gov.
                George W. Bush a five-point lead over Vice President Al Gore, 49 percent to 44 percent. The poll also
                indicates that should Mr. Bush pick Senator John McCain of Arizona as his running mate, he would widen
                his lead. Among all voters, the poll found, 2 of 3 would not be more inclined to vote for Mr. Bush if
                Mr. McCain were added to the ticket. But among independents, 2 of 5 said they would be more inclined to
                vote for Mr. Bush with Mr. McCain on the ticket. The poll, which surveyed 1,003 likely voters from April
                28 to 30, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five points. In a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll
                taken three weeks earlier, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by nine points.

            <textdata>Although he opposed the war in Vietnam, Mr. Gore enlisted in the Army just two months after
                graduating from Harvard in 1969. Friends have said he signed up in part to protect his father, Senator
                Albert Gore, an antiwar Democrat who was running for re-election, from criticism by Republicans who
                supported the war effort. That was a factor to which one longtime associate of the vice president
                referred in the ceremonies today.

                with proposals related to national defense and remarks on international affairs, he made only the
                slightest detour in that direction today, calling anew for the development of a vast national defense
                against ballistic missiles. Both Mr. Gore and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen have recently
                questioned the prudence of his call for a system much larger than the limited defense the Clinton
                administration has proposed.

                active-duty military personnel. And both men said that while it was important to pay tribute to war
                service with monuments and medals, it was even more important to share with young Americans the details
                of sacrifice.

            <textdata>That, as far as I can make out, is what George W. Bush is actually proposing -- though he has been

                alone clearly stated that the percentage cut would have to be a lot larger than the share of
                contributions workers were freed to invest. (The plan described by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan on
                this page yesterday would in effect impose cuts on that scale, mainly through reduced cost-of-living
                adjustments and increased taxes on benefits.)

                today's older Americans didn't have to be met. But that quote isn't made up -- it's what Mr. Bush

                That a parental mistake can lead to an investigation. Or that in the nightmare case, a difficult child
                can be taken away.

                middle-class Bayside, Queens, according to city figures. And in Bushwick, there were 1,413
                investigations of neglect or abuse complaints in 1998, the most recent year for which statistics are
                available, while there were only 109 on the Upper East Side.

                investigation could be the next high-profile tragedy, and the city, which has stepped up enforcement in

                at other times for removing children far too rashly.

            <textdata>Parents in Bushwick talk with dread about the possibility that missing eyeglasses or a broken arm
                could result in accusations of child abuse. Some carry documents clearing them of child abuse charges in
                case they find themselves being questioned by a caseworker. They tell one another to always have a
                doctor's note for school absences. They warn their children about what can happen if they tell tall
                tales at school.

                possible neglect or abuse investigated by the city's child welfare agency every year turn out to be

            <textdata>Sitting along the Brooklyn-Queens border, Bushwick is among the city's poorest neighborhoods. Nine
                out of 10 children in the school district here live below the federal poverty line. A majority of
                residents are blacks and Latinos, and growing numbers among them are newcomers from Mexico and the
                Dominican Republic, with little or no ability to communicate in English.

                haunt one later.

                arm of the Bush campaign. ''We have tremendous respect for what these guys do, and there are skills they
                have that are almost uniquely suited to a presidential campaign,'' Mr. Stevens said. Mr. Ferguson will
                assemble an informal group of people in New York who may be asked to help write Mr. Bush's television
                commercials, Mr. Stevens said. Mr. Ferguson, through an assistant, declined to comment.

                would follow Mr. Bush's lead, Mr. McCain lamented, citing the Senate's vote to reject setting a deadline
                to withdraw ground troops from Kosovo. Only 15 Senate Republicans, including Mr. McCain, backed the
                measure.

                That is one of several ways in which he would spend more on national defense, which he says is currently

            <textdata>The presidential race is also expected to have a significant impact on the campaign. Republicans
                are counting on a strong showing by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, their presumptive presidential
                nominee, to help Mr. Vinroot. Mr. Bush is heavily favored to win North Carolina, but the size of a Bush
                victory could be crucial.

            <textdata>Short of enacting federal legislation, a Bush administration and a Republican-controlled Congress
                could achieve the same ends through other means. One way would be to tie federal block grants for law
                enforcement to a condition that any city accepting the money not sue the gun companies. Federal law
                enforcement aid to cities and states has typically been through block grants, often with conditions
                attached. The Clinton administration, for example, has prided itself on providing money for the hiring
                of 100,000 police officers, who, under the program, were required to be assigned to community policing.

                overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision. The commercials also warn that Mr. Bush

                will appoint justices who will ''strictly interpret'' the Constitution. Kate Michelman, president of the
                league, says many pro-rights supporters have been lulled into thinking that the right to a legal
                abortion is secure when, in fact, it is in danger because two or more supporters may leave the court in
                the next administration.

            <textdata>In a sharp exchange that gave the presidential campaign the intensity of a day in late October,
                Vice President Al Gore accused Gov. George W. Bush today of devising a ''secret plan'' that could
                bankrupt the Social Security system. Hours later, Mr. Bush tartly questioned the vice president's
                honesty and predicted that Mr. Gore's attacking style would soon backfire.

            <textdata>Echoing a theme he has repeated often in recent days, Mr. Gore used a speech to union officials in
                New Jersey to assert that Mr. Bush, the likely Republican nominee, was quietly developing a ''risky''
                plan to allow individual investment accounts in Social Security that would jeopardize millions of
                taxpayers' savings.

            <textdata>''How does the Bush plan propose to deal with the bankruptcy of Social Security that his
                privatization scheme would cause?'' Mr. Gore told a gathering of A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials in Atlantic
                City. ''He doesn't even bother to provide an answer. He just smiles and goes on with the smug assumption
                that there's no need to share with you the details of what he wants to do.''

            <textdata>Responding to Mr. Gore's cascade of attacks, Mr. Bush spent much of a plane flight this afternoon
                from Austin, Tex., to Palm Springs, Calif., telling reporters that the vice president had flatly
                misrepresented his record on a host of issues, ranging from the Texas budget to his positions on China
                and Russia to his crime-fighting policies.

            <textdata>''Someone running for the highest office of the land should stick to the facts,'' Mr. Bush said.
                ''I think it is a pattern to say things, to stretch the truth. He's the man who said he invented the
                Internet.''

            <textdata>Asked whether Mr. Gore's aggressive campaigning might work as well against him as it did against
                former Senator Bill Bradley during the Democratic primaries, Mr. Bush said he planned to respond faster
                and more forcefully than Mr. Bradley.

            <textdata>In fact, rather than being aggrieved by his opponent's attacks, Mr. Bush seemed somewhat amused by
                the constant salvos from the vice president, suggesting that Mr. Gore's strategy was self-defeating.
                ''Pretty soon, it's going to have a corrosive effect on his campaign if he's not telling the truth,''
                Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gore during the 78-minute airborne news conference. ''The fact that he relies on
                facts -- says things that are not factual -- are going to undermine his campaign.''

            <textdata>Mr. Gore's aides clearly disagree. Privately, they contend that the slashing strategy they
                employed during the primaries will work again in the general election, provided they avoid the
                appearance of attacking Mr. Bush personally.

            <textdata>''I will devote all interest from debt reduction to shore up Social Security,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I
                think it is wrong to cut benefits, raise the retirement age or risk your retirement savings in a game of

            <textdata>But that description amounted to one brief passage in a 35-minute speech that was devoted mainly
                to attacking Mr. Bush on a variety of fronts, particularly Social Security.

            <textdata>Under the proposal floated by Mr. Bush's aides in recent days, taxpayers would be allowed to

            <textdata>But Mr. Gore asserted today that the plan would make the system vulnerable to huge market
                fluctuations that could hurt millions of retirees. And as he has repeatedly done in recent days, he
                suggested that Mr. Bush was charting a course that was ''reckless'' and ''irresponsible.''

            <textdata>That approach, he argued, would be harmful to people who do strenuous manual labor and physically
                cannot postpone retirement. And he accused Mr. Bush of wanting to cut Social Security spending to pay
                for a tax cut that Mr. Gore argues would favor the rich.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush's aides acknowledge that he has not ruled out raising the retirement age. But they note
                that he has not formulated a detailed plan yet, only the general principles for one. Those include not
                increasing Social Security taxes, not cutting benefits and setting aside the Social Security surplus in
                a ''lockbox'' to make sure it is used only on Social Security.

                18-year-old daughters, Barbara and Jenna.

                the girls' final selection hinged on? Mum was the word. Aides acknowledged that the information would
                probably trickle out soon enough, through an unguarded utterance by Mr. Bush or an offhand comment by an
                official at one of the schools. But for just a bit longer, the family wanted to try to preserve the
                girls' privacy.

            <textdata>The Bush family has been remarkably successful at that, so much so that while Mr. Bush could
                become the next president and while his extended family is beginning to look an awful lot like a
                political dynasty, his two daughters are almost invisible, their faces unknown to 99.9 percent of voters
                outside Texas and their public sightings only slightly more frequent than Bigfoot's.

            <textdata>Mr. Bush has similarly benefited from news organizations' voluntary restraint. Austin is not so
                big a place, and there are reporters whose children -- or whose friends' children -- attend the same
                public high school from which Barbara and Jenna Bush will be graduating this month. But the fruits of
                that familiarity have not found their way onto television or into newspapers.

                wishes that his daughters remain journalistically off-limits, and he thus talks somewhat freely about

                ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Melrose Place,'' and noted that they would sometimes stop their father

                their own desires as much as their parents' efforts. For example, Barbara and Jenna Bush briefly
                considered accompanying their parents to the polls in Texas for the Republican primary; it was, after
                all, the first election cycle in which the girls were old enough to vote.

                appealing a court decision that ruled the vouchers, but not the grading, unconstitutional. In a speech
                outlining his presidential campaign pledges on education, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas proposed grading
                all schools and stripping some federal financing from those that received low grades for three years.

            <textdata>Many people have their doubts. Though it may seem logical for Mr. Gore to try to bathe his less
                well known opponent in a negative light, the strategy carries clear risks, say independent analysts and
                some Democrats as well.

            <textdata>For one thing, Mr. Gore is now playing to an audience very different from that of the primary
                campaign. Back then he was talking to largely sympathetic crowds of Democrats. Now he must court swing
                voters who are likely to be more skeptical of his credibility and less accepting of his attacks on Mr.
                Bush. Taken too far, the attacks could make him appear unpleasant, overly partisan, mean-spirited and
                untrustworthy to the very independent and crossover voters he is courting.

            <textdata>Even some Democrats seem to think that Mr. Gore's attacks occasionally go over the top. On
                Wednesday, Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of devising a ''secret'' Social Security ''privatization'' plan
                that would bankrupt the system. Today Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who supports
                investing some of the Social Security trust fund in private markets, took issue with the word
                ''privatization.''

        <entry>
            <date>5-5-2000</date>
            <textdata>Another danger for Mr. Gore is that voters will perceive his criticisms of Mr. Bush as personal.
                Mr. Gore's aides argue that his attacks are aimed solely at Mr. Bush's record and proposals. (Today
                alone, the vice president blasted Mr. Bush's positions on the census, managed care and gun control.)

            <textdata>But the adjectives the vice president has used in describing Mr. Bush's policies -- ''reckless,''
                ''risky,'' ''irresponsible,'' ''smug,'' ''arrogant,'' ''noticeably blank'' -- also seem intended to
                raise questions about the governor's character, intellect and competence, many analysts say.

                aloof elitist who viewed politics as ''an intellectual exercise.'' The Gore campaign seems to be trying
                to exploit the opposite with Mr. Bush, who, unlike Mr. Bradley, a Rhodes scholar, is viewed by his
                critics as lacking intellectual depth on complex issues, particularly foreign affairs.

            <textdata>Democratic strategists argue that Mr. Gore may have little choice but to attack so vigorously and
                so early in the campaign, as he did against Mr. Bradley. For one thing, he is trailing Mr. Bush,
                although by small margins, in most polls, including those in customarily Democratic states like
                Washington and West Virginia. And because he is so well known, many voters already hold relatively fixed
                opinions of him, as many bad as good, most polls show.

        <entry>
            <date>5-5-2000</date>
            <textdata>In contrast, Mr. Bush, despite his famous name, remains something of a mystery to voters outside
                Texas. So Mr. Gore, the reasoning goes, needs to define his rival as a risky, out-of-the-mainstream
                alternative. That was the very strategy that Mr. Bush's father, also a two-term vice president at the
                time, used with great success 12 years ago against another governor running for president, Michael S.
                Dukakis of Massachusetts.

            <textdata>''If you become viewed as a risk, as Michael Dukakis was in 1988, it is a very tough road to get
                back from,'' said Susan Estrich, who managed Mr. Dukakis's campaign. ''If Al Gore can raise questions
                about Bush, Bush may never get off the ground. So Gore will just keep doing it.''

            <textdata>But Ms. Estrich praised Mr. Bush's ability to roll with Mr. Gore's punches and, in the process,
                make him seem like a negative politician. ''It seems to be working,'' she said of the governor's
                approach. ''He's up.''

            <textdata>In adopting Mr. Bradley's strategy of calling Mr. Gore dishonest, Bush aides have also
                appropriated one of Mr. Bradley's sharpest debate lines, which they often strip across news releases:
                ''Why should we believe you would tell the truth as president if you don't tell the truth as a
                candidate?''

            <textdata>But Mr. Bush is also a candidate far different from Mr. Bradley, with a campaign quicker in its
                responses to the vice president's blasts. On Tuesday, for instance, Mr. Gore asserted that criminal
                recidivism rates in Texas had increased significantly during the Bush administration; within hours, Mr.
                Bush's press office had issued its own statistics rebutting the charge. Mr. Bradley's campaign sometimes
                let days go by before responding to attacks.

            <textdata>And on Wednesday, after Mr. Gore's Social Security attack, Mr. Bush spent much of a flight to
                California giving reporters a spirited, point-by-point response to many of Mr. Gore's recent
                accusations.

            <textdata>That high-altitude news conference underscored what many Republicans say are Mr. Bush's greatest
                strengths as a campaigner: his sunny persona, his humor and his ability to cloak tart retorts in genial
                language. Those traits, Republicans say, make Mr. Gore seem all the more stiff and mean-spirited by
                comparison.

            <textdata>MARCH 16 -- ''Governor Bush's tax scheme is so risky, so reckless, that just yesterday the
                Republican-controlled House of Representatives, given an opportunity to vote for it, turned it down,
                turned the other way, said, 'We don't want to even cast a vote on that thing.' ''

            <textdata>APRIL 30 -- ''Just this past week, Governor Bush used his brief meeting with Russian Foreign
                Minister Ivanov to issue a warning that his intention would be to build and deploy a global Star Wars
                system that he believes could defend the U.S. and all our allies against any missile launch from any
                source. In the 1990's, most serious analysts took a look at the implausibility of this endeavor, the
                fantastical price that our taxpayers would be expected to pay and the dangerously destabilizing
                consequences of traveling down that path and rejected this notion. Governor Bush wishes to return to it,
                and chose the worst possible venue in which to launch, for lack of a better phrase, his risky foreign
                policy scheme.''

            <textdata>MAY 3 -- ''How does the Bush plan propose to deal with the bankruptcy of Social Security that his
                privatization scheme would cause? He doesn't even bother to provide an answer. He just smiles and goes

            <textdata>This accusation momentarily befuddled both campaigns, neither of which could find evidence that
                Mr. Gore had belonged to the gun lobby. Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said the governor
                might have been referring to a Time magazine article this year that quoted an N.R.A. official as saying
                Mr. Gore, who represented rural Tennessee in Congress, had once been so opposed to gun control that he
                could have been the poster boy for it.

            <date>5-5-2000</date>
            <textdata>Now this is a legitimate question. Mr. Bush has no experience in foreign policy, the
                well-displayed gaps in his knowledge suggest he may not have even read the newspaper much, and this
                could make him easy prey for the foreign policy ideologues in his party.

        <entry>
            <date>5-5-2000</date>
            <textdata>But in raising this question Mr. Gore, inadvertently, raises a question about himself -- a
                question that many people who respect him have been asking. If you talk to Al Gore about geopolitics,
                the Internet or the global economy, you leave feeling he really does get it. But what good are brains if
                you don't always act on them? Mr. Bush may not have the brains to always do the right thing, but does
                Mr. Gore have the spine?

        <entry>
            <date>5-5-2000</date>
            <textdata>Most of Mr. Gore's speech was a serious appeal for an activist, internationalist U.S. foreign
                policy -- something that, in fairness, Mr. Bush would also pursue. So what was legitimate in Mr. Gore's
                critique of Mr. Bush? It's the charge that the internationalism Mr. Bush offers often sounds like a
                we-will-do-whatever-we-want-because-we're-the-only-superpower-and-I-am-not-a-wimp-like-Clinton set of
                policies, which, if adopted at once, could be destabilizing and would have virtually no allied support.
                The best thing you can say is that Mr. Bush doesn't really mean some of this stuff. But what if he does?

            <textdata>If it were his father, the former president, you know that he would do the prudent thing. But we
                don't know that with George W., and when you look at his own party's willingness to be led around by the
                fringe views of Jesse Helms, well, Mr. Gore is right to ask: Is George W. his father's son or his
                advisers' captive?

            <date>5-5-2000</date>
            <textdata>But as for Mr. Gore, in his speech he called for a foreign policy of ''forward engagement'' --
                addressing problems early before they become a crisis and doing so ''as close to the source of the
                problem as possible.'' Well, I can think of no problem more in need of such forward engagement than the
                U.S. embargo of Fidel Castro's Cuba, which has failed for 40 years to oust the Cuban dictator and, if
                continued, is only going to ensure that when Castro dies the Cuban economy collapses, civil war breaks
                out and thousands of Cubans sail for Miami. Fixing that policy means engaging the hard-line Miami
                Cubans, who want no change in policy, but as Mr. Gore showed in the Elian case, that sort of tough love
                is not his thing.

            <textdata>Elian was not a one-day story. It was one of those moments when you get to see everyone's
                character: Attorney General Janet Reno stood her ground. Mr. Bush said what his advisers told him to
                say. And Mr. Gore tried to both exploit the Elian saga for political advantage and hide from it.

            <date>5-5-2000</date>
            <textdata>In his speech, Mr. Gore decried ''protectionism and isolationism,'' but when union-led
                demonstrators were disrupting the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle in the name of more
                protectionism, Mr. Gore was silent. What good is it to be for things in principle if you won't take them
                on in practice? I know Mr. Gore has cast tough votes before. I know he has to get elected. But the
                growing trend in the Clinton years was that the campaign never ends. This administration has not given a
                Sister Souljah speech to anyone in a long, long time.

                really mean it, and won't do the wrong thing. He'll wise up. And the best you can say about Al Gore is
                that he really does mean it and will do the right thing. He'll stand up. But both still have something
                to prove.

                governor said on Wednesday that one reason Republicans had hit hard times in California was that the
                party's presidential nominees in 1992 and 1996 had abandoned any hope of winning the state.

            <textdata>BUSH VOWS FIGHT IN CALIFORNIA -- On the second of what will amount to at least four swings through
                California this spring, Gov. George W. Bush insisted yesterday that he was determined to fight for the
                state's 54 electoral votes and would not repeat the actions of the last two Republican presidential

            <textdata>READ MY LIPS: NO SMIRK -- California was not the only place where Gov. George W. Bush discussed
                his father's presidential campaigns. In an ABC News interview to be broadcast today, he says his father
                seriously undermined his credibility by breaking the ''read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge that had
                helped him win the White House in 1988. The Texas governor, who himself has taken a no-new-taxes pledge,
                says the switch helped lead to his father's defeat by Bill Clinton. As for President Clinton, Mr. Bush
                sharply criticizes his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. ''He and Mrs. Clinton have done a great job with
                their daughter, no question about it,'' Mr. Bush says. ''But Bill Clinton, unfortunately, in the last
                chapter of the 20th century, embarrassed our nation.'' Mr. Bush gave Vice President Al Gore credit for
                being ''a loving husband and a good dad.'' But he says he is ''a little worried about a man who tends to
                stretch the truth in order to get ahead politically.'' And what of criticism of himself, especially the
                charge that he wears a habitual smirk? ''I find a great irony in life and I find humor,'' he replies.
                ''And I find it amazing that people would spend time analyzing whether I was smiling or not, as opposed
                to what my views are on education or keeping the economy strong or cutting taxes.''

                control as a political issue but also Mr. Bush's desire to court swing voters, many of whom favor
                greater regulation of firearms.

            <textdata>WEIGHING BUDGET PROPOSALS -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas began a news conference in San Diego

                suggesting that he did not produce such extensive spending blueprints. The books in his hand, Mr. Bush

                about running mates, but an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll has found that most voters have already
                made up their minds. Among Republicans and independents, 40 percent want Mr. Bush to pick Gen. Colin L.
                Powell, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 20 percent favor Senator John McCain of
                Arizona and 15 percent favor Elizabeth Dole, the former secretary of labor. Among Democrats and
                independents, 33 percent want Mr. Gore to pick former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and 18 percent
                favor Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. The poll surveyed 1,003 registered voters from April 29 to
                May 1 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

            <textdata>As if to ratify Mr. Clinton's triumph, The Washington Post ran a front-page headline on Monday: ''
                'Clinton Fatigue' Yields to Nostalgia.'' The Post cited polls showing that not only would Democrats
                vastly prefer Mr. Clinton to Al Gore as a candidate this year but that in a recent match-up the
                president pulled even with George W. Bush nationwide. Granted, this country has a short memory, but
                isn't Bill Clinton the same guy who was impeached and tried only 15 months ago? It's almost an insult to
                call him the comeback kid. He's had more comebacks than Elizabeth Taylor, Liza Minnelli and Richard
                Nixon combined.

            <textdata>But where, pray tell, are those hearings? Apparently Clinton nostalgia trumps whatever remains of
                his opponents' testosterone. Reflecting the president's clout, polls showed that 60 percent approved of
                the raid and 68 percent didn't want any hearings -- numbers consistent with those balking at impeachment
                hearings and the Congressional release of the Starr report two years ago. No sooner did the Elian
                inquisition flame out than Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Congressman, also decided not ''to pursue any more
                hearings'' on Hillary Clinton's government-paid transportation for her Senate campaign. Such is Mr.
                Clinton's political potency that James Rogan, a House impeachment prosecutor now battling for
                re-election in California, popped up with the impeached president in a White House rally for gun
                control. Surely it's only days before William Bennett concedes to Larry King that, all in all, the
                Clintons' marriage is more credible than that of the other aspiring senatorial couple, the Giulianis,
                who can't even fake a truce for the sake of their kids after a cancer diagnosis. My first sighting of
                conspicuous Republican nostalgia for Mr. Clinton was in March, when Ben Stein, the former Nixon
                speechwriter and host of TV's ''Win Ben Stein's Money,'' praised the president in USA Today for showing
                ''a lot of heart'' by sending top administration officials to the funeral of his father, the G.O.P.
                economist Herbert Stein. Ben Stein dislikes Mr. Clinton, writes for the Clinton-bashing journal American
                Spectator and is solidly behind Mr. Bush. And yet he had this to say over the phone this week: ''I will
                miss Clinton's humanity like I miss Nixon's humanity. You know a person is a person by his failings, and
                Clinton has a lot of failings. Without that human touch, you lose an important ability to connect with
                the body politic. Two machines are running to replace him -- the Gore machine, in which everything is
                calculated and calibrated, and the Bush machine, which is even more so. I don't like the idea of being
                governed by a machine. I like being governed by someone who has as many failings as I do.''

                of the vast difference between the two men. ''Clinton only shows you what he wants you to see,'' he

                puppetmaster. You see the ventriloquist's mouth move. The poor guy is trying too hard. So much
                preparation, so earnest, so much fumbling and stumbling. He should go out and say I can't act, I can't

            <textdata>This shortfall makes it unlikely that Clinton nostalgia will automatically benefit Mr. Gore come
                fall. If anything, the closest heir to Mr. Clinton so far is Mr. Bush. The president indicated as much
                in his stand-up routine, when he joked that the Texas governor had hijacked his old Dick Morris campaign
                strategy of ''moving toward the political center, distancing himself from his own party [and] stealing
                ideas from the other party.'' The parallels don't end there, or with the unsubstantiated drug rumors
                that have stalked both men without ever denting their political fortunes.

                in students' test scores than are Mr. Bush's hyperbolic claims for Texas. Mr. Bush's ''compassionate
                conservatism'' -- in which the federal government plays bite-sized roles in helping to feel and soothe
                Americans' pain -- lifts specific ideas from Mr. Clinton's New Democrat policies. Both men also have in
                common the repellent trait of advertising their toughness on crime by savage brandishing of the death
                penalty as governors: Mr. Clinton refused clemency to the brain-damaged Rickey Ray Rector; Mr. Bush

                suing gun manufacturers, while Gov. George W. Bush suggested he might support such a measure. Mr. Bush
                also cast the vice president as a candidate whose advocacy of more stringent restrictions on firearms
                was simply the latest fashion, not a matter of steadfast principle.

                teachers and increase teachers' salaries, but only if the states and teachers' unions agreed that all
                new teachers meet rigorous national standards and only if hiring decisions are based on expertise, not
                seniority alone.

                dams to be breached, while Vice President Al Gore, part of an administration that is intensely debating
                the issue, has taken no public position.

                for Congress. And the president's closest advisers say that although he is no longer running himself,
                his passion for electoral politics has never receded. They also cite another, more personal, reason for
                Mr. Clinton's deep involvement: he wants to burnish his own legacy with the election of Mr. Gore to
                succeed him, the installation of Mrs. Clinton as senator from New York and the return of the House to
                Democratic control.

            <textdata>''Bill Clinton fascinates me,'' he said. ''Americans loved him. Why? Because Clinton made
                mistakes. It means he was learning something and getting better.'' Rapaille said that in the late 80's,
                Lee Atwater, then working for George Bush p re, hired him to do an archetype study of the presidency.
                Though financing ran out before Rapaille could complete his work, he was able to gather useful material
                in the word-association sessions. Participants compared the chief executive to a ''movie character'';
                they said he could ''make people see things.'' From this, Rapaille was able to identify the core
                emotional nubbin. Fatherhood? Celebration? Nationalism? No, no. The presidency is: ''cheap
                entertainment.''

                nearly the handicap that Gore's leaden personality is. Rapaille gives Bush the edge, but neither one of
                them interests him much. He openly pines for Bill Clinton the icon (not the politician). Mistakes
                weren't Clinton's only asset. America's code, according to Rapaille, is built around ''hope.'' That's
                why Clinton's slogan in 1992 ''was simply brilliant,'' Rapaille said. ''I still believe in a place
                called ''hope.''' He's almost a genius.'' Clinton had instinctively hit the grand slam of presidential
                codes. Mistakes. Cheap Entertainment. Hope.

                Crown package. Race officials hope the switch will provide more promotion and exposure for the Derby,
                which has had declining ratings. The Derby, however, falls in the middle of the National Basketball
                Association playoffs, which NBC also televises. Churchill Downs officials realize their telecast may be
                sandwiched between N.B.A. games -- for better or worse. . . . A former president and a presidential
                candidate were Derby guests of WILLIAM FARISH, the Churchill Downs president. Former President GEORGE

            <textdata>The ''it'' was, perhaps, the most uncomfortable moment of political humor of the television
                season. After weeks of goading by Mr. Letterman, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas agreed to appear by
                satellite on his show, an encounter that was, by most assessments, a disaster for the Republican
                presidential candidate. Mr. Bush, hampered by the split-second time delay and projecting an air of being
                led on a forced march, offered one lame quip after another, including a pun about Mr. Letterman's recent
                heart operation so strained that it left the host staring, mortified, into the camera.

            <textdata>Having a serious impact on real events is, of course, the last thing on the minds of most of the
                writers and performers of political satire on television. ''I just want the politicians and the people
                who watch our show to know that this is a place where the buck honestly stops,'' said Bill Maher, the
                no-nonsense host of ''Politically Incorrect,'' ABC's freewheeling after-hours talkfest. Still, as the
                Bush appearance on ''Letterman'' illustrates, political comedy relies ever more intensively on the
                willing (and in some instances unwitting) participation of actual officeholders and officeseekers.

                Bush on his show, Mr. Maher laughed at the improbability of such an appearance. ''I've been so hard on

                ''Letterman,'' a show that has become a kind of political proving ground. Gerard Mulligan, a longtime

                to his comic denunciations. For weeks, he complained on the air about Hillary Rodham Clinton's refusal
                to appear on the show after announcing her campaign for the Senate seat from New York.

            <textdata>In a series of brisk exchanges last week, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush laid out
                their disagreements over gun control, foreign policy, tax cuts, Social Security and Mr. Bush's record in
                Texas. Perhaps because he is struggling to stay even with Mr. Bush in the polls, Mr. Gore was on the
                attack almost every day, using highly personal language to derogate his opponent's policies. The
                subtext, however, was not about policy. It was about experience and temperament. Mr. Gore, with his
                customary lack of subtlety, was suggesting that Mr. Bush is an untested leader with half-baked ideas.
                Stressing the value of experience is a time-honored strategy for the more seasoned candidate in
                presidential contests. But it comes with no guarantee of success. Otherwise we would never have had
                presidents named Carter, Reagan and Clinton.

            <textdata>Jimmy Carter has been on both sides of the experience strategy. He won as a new face in 1976, but
                when he tried in 1980 to depict the Republican challenger, Ronald Reagan, as unready for the White
                House, the tactic backfired. Mr. Reagan was a deft campaigner and debater who skillfully parried Mr.
                Carter's attempt to make him appear a lightweight. That bit of history bears a cautionary message for
                Mr. Gore. Even though the vice president is the best debater in presidential politics today, Mr. Bush
                could gain significantly with a better-than-expected performance. For now, he is arguing that the vice
                president's extreme attacks distort his record and insult the voters.

            <textdata>Down the road, however, he will have to engage Mr. Gore's points more directly. The vice president
                is right to raise questions about Mr. Bush's achievement in education, the environment, health care and
                budget issues. He may have exaggerated Mr. Bush's lack of budget experience, but his point that Texas

            <textdata>On foreign policy, Mr. Gore is also raising some fair questions about Mr. Bush, though there is a
                fine line between the license granted politicians who speak in generalities and outright distortion. The
                vice president accuses the governor of having a cold-war ''mindset'' that treats China and Russia as
                ''enemies.'' Mr. Bush says he has gone out of his way to assert the contrary. But Mr. Bush would
                withdraw loans and credits to Russia over its crackdown in Chechnya and abrogate the Antiballistic
                Missile Treaty. These two steps would be dangerously confrontational.

            <textdata>Even so, Mr. Gore goes too far in accusing Mr. Bush of being an isolationist. As his father's son,
                he would be heir to policies -- and advisers -- that are international in outlook. As for China's status
                as a trade partner, Mr. Bush's position is the same as that of the Clinton administration.

            <textdata>The arena where Mr. Gore has used his toughest language, surprisingly, is the budget. He
                repeatedly labels as perilous both the governor's $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan and his proposal to carve
                private investment accounts out of the Social Security system. In fact, Mr. Gore's reliance on the word
                ''risky'' for almost every Bush proposal probably should inspire someone to send the vice president a
                thesaurus. His point, however, is right. The tax cut, which Mr. Gore says would actually cost more than
                $2 trillion if you included the extra interest expenses from not paying down the debt, is ill-advised.
                And Mr. Bush has not addressed warnings from such stellar Republicans as Alan Greenspan that a big tax
                cut now could hurt the economy.

            <textdata>It is of course an exaggeration for Mr. Gore to say that Mr. Bush has a ''secret plan'' for Social
                Security. There is something to be said for Mr. Bush's not getting lost in details, as former Senator
                Bill Bradley did earlier this year on the health issue. But the governor needs to flesh out his ideas on
                Social Security privatization. He must also explain how he would pay for his tax cut and at the same
                time increase military and education spending without jeopardizing other vital programs.

            <textdata>There is a risk that the public could be turned off by bitter exchanges over policy minutiae and
                budget numbers. But such debates take the measure of the candidates. For Mr. Gore they reveal a policy
                aficionado who also has a gladiatorial instinct for verbal combat. For Mr. Bush they reveal someone who
                prefers to be aloof from detail, but who may not be able to pull that off with the ease of a Ronald
                Reagan. As the debate over experience continues, the candidates will be eyeing the polls for a reading
                on what the voters make of Mr. Bush's desire to float above the fray or Mr. Gore's desire to plunge into
                it.

                might smile to hear the latest Clinton White House strategy. The president and his national security

                China isn't just about profit opportunities, it's also about national security. At the same time, the

                Wolfowitz, dean of the school of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and one of
                those advisers, wrote recently, AIDS in Africa and the environment are serious problems, but calling
                them national security threats carries ''the implication that conventional security is no longer

                Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster who collaborates with Mr. Hart on the NBC News/ Wall Street Journal
                poll, said one reason for Bush support among older people was that ''only about 6 percent of the old

            <textdata>That may be reasonable enough, but Mr. Gore's own weakness as a candidate compounds that problem.
                After all, Mr. Gore is campaigning on a promise to keep the same economic policies Mr. Clinton has
                followed, while Mr. Bush's central campaign message is that he wants a very big tax cut.

            <textdata>Mr. Teeter said the data in the NBC/Journal poll explained it. ''Gore is not a very good
                candidate,'' he said. ''He is not a very likable candidate.'' Mr. Teeter argued that Mr. Gore's frequent
                attacks on Mr. Bush ran the risk ''of looking like the guy who is out of his time,'' out of step with an
                optimistic country.

            <textdata>There is no question that the Gore message in the summer and fall will emphasize continuity and
                accuse Mr. Bush of risking prosperity for a needless tax cut. Comparisons with the last Republican
                administration are inevitable, but will have special bite because the phrase ''Bush recession'' will
                surely be used.

                in a Philadelphia suburb as offering hope for Mr. Gore. Everyone in the group of 12, whether he or she
                favored Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore, ''wanted the same policies,'' he said. ''They didn't want to tinker with

            <textdata>The best evidence that it is not too late for Mr. Gore comes from a New York Times/CBS News Poll
                taken in May 1988. That was the last time a vice president ran to succeed a popular president in an
                economic boom. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis led Vice President George Bush, 49 percent to 39 percent. It did
                not last.

                Washington law firm of Patton Boggs, whose clients include Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, billed $7,264
                in legal fees as recently as March. Stephen Moore, an economist with the Cato Institute in Washington,
                received $27,500 for fine-tuning Mr. Pataki's fiscal proposals, while Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for
                Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan, was paid $10,000 to polish his words.

                whom many voters across the country might find unexpected could provide credibility for presidential
                candidates introducing themselves to a national audience. Coming out of Georgia in 1976, Jimmy Carter
                enlisted the civil rights leader Andrew Young to help demonstrate that he was a Southern Democrat of a
                sort different from the race-baiting George C. Wallace. In the same vein, Mr. Black said, Mr. Bush is
                enlisting Texas Democrats to help reassure voters that he is different from the combative Congressional
                Republicans of the 1990's.

                from governor to lieutenant governor to land commissioner, and Mr. Bush won with nearly 70 percent of

            <textdata>''Right now, our fight is not statewide,'' Mr. McClung said. ''George W. Bush is popular. He's
                extremely well financed. And most Texans would prefer to have a president from Texas than fight about
                party politics.''

            <textdata>To a large extent, the immediate future of Texas politics depends on Mr. Bush's future. If he wins
                in November, his job will fall to Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican whose replacement would be chosen by
                the State Senate. As the presiding officer of the Senate, the lieutenant governor is considered the
                official with greatest influence over legislation, and a handful of candidates in both parties are
                already jockeying for position.

            <textdata>But neither party dominates the Senate, and no one expects a party-line vote for lieutenant
                governor. Instead, victory will require attracting votes from both sides, and the hopefuls are making
                certain to avoid any partisan warfare. One of them, State Senator Ken Armbrister, was among four
                Democrats who campaigned with Mr. Bush in Ohio last month.

            <textdata>Regardless of the outcome in November, Democrats say, they are pointing to 2002 and beyond. The
                powerful statewide offices of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and comptroller are on the
                ballot in 2002. Mr. Bush will either be in Washington or leaving office in Austin, and Democratic
                officials already envision a statewide ticket that would include Mr. Sharp, Mr. Hobby and perhaps the
                mayors of Dallas, Ron Kirk, and Austin, Kirk Watson.

            <textdata>Mr. McClung and other Democrats also believe that the state's changing demographics may turn in
                their favor in this decade. Hispanics are expected to soon become the state's most populous ethnic
                group, and as yet they usually support Democrats. Mr. Bush has aggressively courted Hispanics, but
                Democrats believe that their appeal is stronger. In addition, college-age voters are showing renewed
                interest in the party. All this is the gospel that Democrats are repeating to themselves.

            <textdata>Nevertheless, we have not seen so much political commitment to better schools since the 1988
                campaign, when George Bush and Michael Dukakis each announced he intended to become the ''education
                president.'' The golden age of pedagogy that everyone expected to flow from this contest somehow failed
                to arrive. Now Al Gore and George W. Bush trade assault e-mail on the subject every single day. Mr. Bush
                cannot talk enough about the way he's improved the schools in Texas. He is particularly voluble about
                having ended social promotion, about how he insisted that no Texas child go from the third grade to the
                fourth until he or she could read at grade level.

                This is the classic political approach to the setting of standards on any topic. You want to be strict
                about the required levels of achievement, but loose about the timetable. The ideal due date, in fact, is
                the year after whoever sets the standards leaves office. If Mr. Bush is lucky, by the time Texas third
                graders start getting held back, he'll be in Washington preparing for his re-election campaign.

            <textdata>To be fair to Mr. Bush, Texas is actually making an attempt to set the bar higher without whopping
                it over the heads of the children who happen to get caught in the transition. This year the teachers
                started getting additional training, and the students' skills are being tested regularly so those who
                start to fall behind can get special tutoring. A timetable that actually prepares kids for the standards
                they're supposed to meet is definitely not silly.

            <textdata>ACCURACY -- It is true that Mr. Bush has often sided with the National Rifle Association in
                legislative battles in his more than five years as governor. Over the objections of gun control
                advocates, he signed legislation allowing people to carry concealed handguns, allowing handguns to be
                taken into churches and prohibiting local governments from suing gun manufacturers. The N.R.A.'s
                executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, also recently helped raise at least $250,000 at a major
                Republican Party fund-raiser honoring Mr. Bush. But Mr. Bush has at times tried to distance himself from
                the organization, by supporting mandatory trigger locks for new handguns and criticizing Mr. LaPierre
                for asserting that President Clinton had tolerated a certain level of gun violence for political
                reasons.

            <date>5-9-2000</date>
            <textdata>SCORECARD -- By trying to depict Mr. Bush as a pawn of the N.R.A., the advertisement seeks to make
                him seem like an extremist on gun control issues, because the N.R.A. is widely perceived as
                intransigently opposed to any restrictions on gun ownership. Also, it suggests that the governor is not
                his own man, that he is beholden to powerful right-wing interest groups. The advertisement is not being
                shown widely enough to affect many voters directly, but Handgun Control is clearly hoping that
                journalists in Washington and Texas will use it to write critical stories about Mr. Bush. The group is
                also running the spot in several cities with hotly contested Congressional races in which gun control
                may become an important issue, including Lansing and Columbus.

                legislation. Bush aides accused Mr. Cuomo of politicizing the issue. ''Instead of spending their time

            <textdata>ABORTION LOOMS AS PLATFORM ISSUE Various interests groups, especially those that support abortion
                rights, plan to have their voices heard when the Republican national convention this summer in
                Philadelphia assembles a platform for this year's nominee. Over the weekend, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of
                Wisconsin, the recently selected chairman of the platform committee, offered them some thoughts. After
                all the hearings are held and all the testimony is heard, he said, the presidential candidate will have
                the last word, not the committee. ''I'm certainly going to be listening to all sectors of the party,''
                Mr. Thompson told The Philadelphia Inquirer. ''But my ultimate client is George Bush, and what he feels
                best is what we will do.'' On the matter of abortion, Mr. Thompson said he would abide by Mr. Bush's
                promises to leave the current plank, which strongly opposes abortion.

            <textdata>RIFT GROWS AMONG ARIZONA REPUBLICANS It is no secret among Arizona Republicans that Gov. Jane Dee
                Hull's endorsement of her fellow governor George W. Bush over her fellow Arizonan Senator John McCain
                left bad feelings on both sides. It was bad enough that last month Ms. Hull agreed to give up the
                governor's prerogative of leading the state's delegation to the Republican National Convention -- after
                all, Mr. McCain easily won the primary, and thus the right to control the state's 30-member delegation.
                Now comes word that Mr. McCain wants his wife, Cindy, to lead the delegation instead. That has rankled
                Hull supporters. The issue is to be decided at the state party convention on Saturday.

            <textdata>Support for the measure grew today. The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, publicly
                endorsed it. Three former presidents, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, issued a letter
                coordinated by the White House warning that defeat ''would be read in China as a vote for confrontation
                and as an argument for hunkering down, instead of continuing to reach out.''

                also supports the measure, but according to aides has not discussed it with Mr. DeLay. So does Vice

            <textdata>But as it turns out, the Texas governor's record is far better than activists allow. Governor Bush
                has tackled environmental problems creatively, with a new approach that emphasizes cooperation over
                conflict.

            <textdata>Second, Governor Bush's predecessors paid relatively little attention to air quality. Mr. Bush
                backed an initiative that made Texas only the third state in the nation to require pollution reductions
                from older power plants that had been exempted from the standards set for more modern ones. By 2003, the
                Bush plan aims to cut nitrogen oxide emissions, a component of smog, in half. The program included some
                voluntary commitments by companies, as well as requirements.

            <textdata>Governor Bush also expanded the ''clean industries 2000'' program, which was started in 1992 by
                Gov. Ann Richards. To participate, companies committed to cutting their toxic or hazardous waste in half
                by this year; in exchange, they may display a special environmental logo. So far, 185 companies have
                together eliminated more than 43 million tons of hazardous waste and reduced energy consumption by 11.3
                million kilowatt hours. Through this and other programs, Texas actually led the nation in reducing toxic
                releases in 1997, the most recent year for which figures have been reported.

            <textdata>Another conservation effort has helped farmers and ranchers develop plans for helping wildlife
                survive on some 10 million acres. On state lands, Mr. Bush led in the creation of a privately financed
                endowment, bolstered by state appropriations, to restore and maintain every state park, wildlife area
                and fish hatchery.

            <textdata>Some environmental groups don't like Mr. Bush's approach, which emphasizes incentives and
                voluntary agreements. But what matters are results. Are pollutants being reduced? Is habitat being
                protected? Are old hazardous-waste sites getting cleaned up? On this score, Governor Bush's performance
                looks surprisingly good.

                did not raise the China issue, but was asked about it in a question-and-answer session.
