  In a speech pungent with tough talk about criminals, drug abusers and his Republican rival for president, Vice President Al Gore called today for a broad array of anticrime measures, among them mandatory drug testing of all prisoners and parolees.

  Choosing a Southern state as the backdrop for one of his most conservative speeches of the presidential campaign, Mr. Gore proposed federal spending of $500 million a year  to help states test, treat and counsel  prisoners and parolees for drug use.

  ''When inmates are sent back to the streets unrehabilitated, unrepentant and unskilled, then they are just going to commit more crime and go right back into prison,'' Mr. Gore said to a crowd filled with uniformed police officers.

  As in all his recent policy speeches, the vice president used a harsh tone to attack Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent Republican presidential nominee, this time maintaining that he had cut state financing of drug treatment by half.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As a result of such policies, Mr. Gore said, Texas under Mr. Bush has experienced a 25 percent increase in the number of former inmates returned to prison for new crimes within three years of release.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore did not suggest that Mr. Bush had been soft on crime, a position that would be hard to defend: in Mr. Bush's five and a half years as governor, Texas has undertaken the nation's largest prison-building program, executed a record number of criminals, lengthened sentences for many crimes and incarcerated a rising number of juveniles.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the vice president did say: ''I believe that we should demand that criminals get clean before they get out of jail. Governor Bush seems content to keep pushing them out of the same revolving door.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides to Mr. Bush disputed Mr. Gore's statistic on Texas recidivism and his accusation that the governor had cut financing of drug treatment. They also said violent crime in the state had fallen 20 percent, to a 20-year low, during the Bush administration. And they asserted that the availability of drug treatment in federal prisons had declined during the Clinton-Gore administration, even as  drug use among adolescents had risen (an assertion disputed in turn by the Gore campaign).
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If Al Gore is willing to attack Texas, where violent crime is at a 20-year low and the largest prison drug-treatment program in the country is located, we're also expecting attacks on Texans for defending the Alamo,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush aide.

  Just as Mr. Bush has tried to move further to the center of the political spectrum with education and health care proposals, Mr. Gore's crime speech today provided him an opportunity to reach out to centrist Republicans and conservative Democrats. And he seized it with gusto.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We can't go back to the finger-pointing and failed strategies that led to that steep increase in crime in the Bush-Quayle administration,'' he said. ''And we can't go back to the old Democratic approach, which was tough on the causes of crime but not tough enough on crime itself, again when people in both political parties wanted us to do more.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's effort to outflank Governor Bush on crime recalls Bill Clinton's drive in the 1992 campaign to neutralize what had been a potent Republican issue by advocating tough anticrime measures, including the death penalty.

  The vice president's speech today, typifying the administration's approach to policy making, offered a mixture of ideas -- some new, some old, many small-bore. Several of the ideas were first discussed by Mr. Gore in a crime speech last July in Boston, where he called for longer sentences for all crimes committed with guns and for requiring photo-bearing licenses for people who buy new handguns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today Mr. Gore restated his support for a proposal that federal money help local governments hire 50,000 new police officers in the coming decade. The Clinton administration has already helped finance the hiring of 60,000 new police officers, with 40,000 more in the pipeline.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also proposed aid to help state and local governments buy computers for crime-fighting purposes, hire new prosecutors and expand after-school programs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also jumped into what has become a contentious debate in Congress by endorsing a constitutional amendment to expand the rights of crime victims. The amendment would grant victims and their families the right to reasonable notice of court proceedings involving their cases, the right to have a voice in those proceedings, and the right to notice of an offender's release or escape from prison.

  Although Mr. Flake endorsed Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination in February, he has criticized the vice president's education policy, which opposes vouchers. Last October, Mr. Flake gave a warm introduction to George W. Bush, whom he referred to as ''my homeboy,'' at a meeting of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative advocacy group, at which Governor Bush outlined his education proposals.

  Bill East was greatly underestimated by the old guard, George Bush and Bob Dole. He upended them and became, heaven help us, the poster boy for his generation, dominating the 90's. His rise was relentless, leaving a trail of enemies behind, using any means at his disposal to rule.

  He staged a midcareer resurgence in the 50's by putting a mute in his horn and familiar pop melodies in his hands. In 1952 Mr. Jones received an offer from the pianist Joe Bushkin to fill in at the Embers, one of New York's 52nd Street jazz clubs. Mr. Jones agreed to put a mute in his horn; this quieter sound was what his predecessor in the band, Buck Clayton, had adopted, and it was what the restaurant preferred. Mr. Jones, whose resume included stints with the society band leaders Lester Lanin and Meyer Davis, wasn't particularly fazed. Despite the fact that his regular style was open, forceful and swinging in the Louis Armstrong vein, he knew how to play softly too.

  Late last year Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and other foes of the McCain-Feingold bill that would ban the unlimited donations to political parties known as soft money never tired of saying that this was an issue of little interest to American voters. Then the reform cause was energized by Senator John McCain's primary campaign, and by a Democratic race in which Vice President Al Gore declared that enactment of the soft-money ban would be one of his highest priorities as president.

  Unfortunately, Gov. George W. Bush has so far joined Mr. Lott as an obstacle to reform. He says he favors a ban on corporation and union contributions to parties, but he would leave open a wide loophole by allowing unlimited donations to parties from individuals. Like other opponents of reform, he calls it a free speech issue. But Congress set limits on individual donations to candidates in 1974 after the Watergate scandals, and the legislation before Congress would simply extend those limits to donations to parties, which have been used to undermine the old reforms.

  Mr. McCain is to meet with the presumptive party nominee in a few days to talk about issues. He needs to press Mr. Bush to support his campaign finance legislation in the Senate, where it commands majority support, and Mr. Bush ought to sign on to real reform. Americans want it. Most in Congress want it. Now even the donors want it. Mr. Bush and Mr. Lott should not stand in their way.

  They are also seeking to score points with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore by stumping for them around the country, dispensing unsolicited political and policy tips and seizing every opportunity to say flattering things about their party's standard bearer. Mindful that they not appear unseemly, the one thing they dare not do is utter two words directly to the candidate: running mate.

  Since the Republican convention is first, Mr. Gore's choice may be in direct reaction to Mr. Bush's. For example, Gore advisers said that if Mr. Bush picks a woman, they might feel pressure to do the same.

  Many Democrats say that Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has been one of the most obvious practitioners of the subtle-but-aggressive approach.

  On the Republican side, advisers to Elizabeth Dole made no secret of her desire to help Mr. Bush -- and get her name out. After ending her own bid for the Republican nomination, she frequently stumped for Mr. Bush in early primary states. And she has the added benefit that her husband, Bob Dole, trumpets her availability while she plays coy.

  Mr. Ridge is an obvious contender because he comes from a battleground state, has a compelling biography as a Vietnam veteran and is versed in national issues from his days in Congress. Most of all, he gets along well with Mr. Bush. To many Republicans, his biggest drawback is that he favors abortion rights, but that position could help Mr. Bush appeal to independents and other swing voters.

  In his appearance here before the Lincoln Club of Northern California, a group of moderate Republicans, Mr. Ridge, brimming with praise for Mr. Bush, spoke of the governor's ''candor, his mischievous humor, his directness, his decision-making ability.''

  Mr. Ridge said the governor's ''compassionate conservative message makes a lot of sense.'' He defended Mr. Bush's controversial proposal to cut taxes by nearly half a trillion dollars, saying, ''I don't think Governor Bush should abandon his plan to cut taxes.''

  After the event, Mr. Ridge insisted in an interview that he had been careful not to campaign to be picked as Mr. Bush's running mate. ''I don't think it's his style,'' Mr. Ridge said of Mr. Bush. ''I don't think it's appropriate. It's certainly not my style.''

  Mr. Gore went on an advertising offensive on Monday against Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, through a series of interviews and television appearances, charging that Mr. Bush would continue ''multitrillion-dollar debts.'' Campaigning today, Mr. Gore called Mr. Bush's Social Security proposal ''bad for America's future and bad for America's economy.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The battle over numbers underscores how much the presidential campaign -- the first one waged in the new era of federal surpluses -- will be fought over economic policy and the related question of how to shore up Social Security. The Gore campaign considers the economic prosperity of the Clinton years one of its greatest assets.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The figures released by Bush aides today addressed a weakness in earlier calculations. With the annual spending battle stepping up on Capitol Hill, the Bush campaign stopped assuming Congress would make large reductions in domestic spending, instead assuming discretionary domestic spending would grow.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At the same time, Mr. Bush's advisers argued that the growth in the economy over the past six months means the federal surplus will be larger than previously forecast. They said that under their new calculations the estimated federal surplus across 10 years -- after $2.2 trillion is set aside for Social Security -- will amount to $1.8 trillion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That is roughly $1 trillion more than the Gore campaign estimates and about $500 billion more than the Bush campaign's earlier projections. Mr. Gore assumes a higher rate of spending and a less robust economy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides said his cut would use 1.3 trillion surplus dollars, allowing $512 billion for other programs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The bottom line is clear,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Bush campaign's chief economic adviser. ''Governor Bush's plan takes care of Social Security first, provides America's working families with a tax break and does it all within the context of a balanced budget.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign's new calculations were released less than 24 hours after Mr. Gore's aides held their own session with reporters and released an array of numbers they said showed that to accommodate his tax cut, Mr. Bush either had to make ''cuts in core areas of government that are unimaginable'' or risk a return to deficits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's aides were still critical of Mr. Bush today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Last month he claimed that his tax cut and spending increases were paid for,'' said Elaine Kamarck, policy adviser to Mr. Gore. ''Today, after finding more money, Bush still can't pay for his promises for a huge tax cut, increased spending and privatization of Social Security.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign said Mr. Bush was underestimating spending, and Mr. Bush's advisers refused to disclose how much Mr. Bush's embrace of a national missile defense system and prescription drug program would cost, while saying the proposals fit in their spending plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The most serious dispute between the two campaigns is the true cost of Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal. Mr. Bush's aides said the tax cut would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years from 2001-2010. Over just five years they said it would cost $460 billion, slightly less than their original estimate of $483 billion. And they pointed to an analysis from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation backing them. The committee is controlled by Republicans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign argued that it was more appropriate to examine the tax cut through 2011, since the tax cut does not go into effect until fiscal 2002. Mr. Gore's aides said that once that extra year is added in, as well as lost interest costs, the tax cut costs $2 trillion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another looming battle is over debt reduction and Social Security. Mr. Gore has made eliminating the public debt the centerpiece of his economic agenda. He says that Mr. Bush's proposal for putting some Social Security money into individual retirement accounts will carry a huge cost because it will require using part of the federal surplus that would otherwise go toward eliminating the national debt.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides counter that by giving individual workers their own retirement accounts, which can be invested in financial markets, they decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay benefits out of tax revenues. This itself, they say, is a form of debt reduction.

  GOV. THOMPSON NAMED PLATFORM CHAIRMAN  Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin has been named chairman of the committee that will draft the Republican platform at the party's national convention this summer, an appointment that abortion rights advocates regard as a sign that George W. Bush, the presumed presidential nominee, will not ease the party's staunch anti-abortion position. Two years ago, Governor Thompson signed legislation outlawing the procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said the selection showed that Mr. Bush, despite his advocacy of inclusiveness, ''cares about what the far right of his party wants.'' Mr. Thompson said after his appointment on Monday that he looked forward to ''serving on the committee to articulate our party's most innovative ideas, the principles that bind us together and our vision for the future.''

  BUSH HOLDS NARROW LEAD  The latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup presidential preference poll gives Gov. George W. Bush a five-point lead over Vice President Al Gore, 49 percent to 44 percent. The poll also indicates that should Mr. Bush pick Senator John McCain of Arizona as his running mate, he would widen his lead. Among all voters, the poll found, 2 of 3 would not be more inclined to vote for Mr. Bush if Mr. McCain were added to the ticket. But among independents, 2 of 5 said they would be more inclined to vote for Mr. Bush with Mr. McCain on the ticket. The poll, which surveyed 1,003 likely voters from April 28 to 30, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five points. In a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll taken three weeks earlier, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by nine points.

We need only to recall Michael S. Dukakis riding in a tank or the new earth-tone Al Gore to realize that dress, manner and looks are important parameters of public perception.

  Faced with lawsuits by 31 cities and counties, the nation's gun companies have broken off settlement negotiations, deciding to rely on their chances that state judges will prove sympathetic or that victory in November will go to George W. Bush.

  Faced with lawsuits by 31 cities and counties, the nation's gun companies have broken off settlement negotiations, deciding to rely on their chances that state judges will prove sympathetic or that victory in November will go to George W. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Instead, people on both sides of the litigation say, the gun companies,  believing that the November elections will be crucial to their future,  are holding off any further settlement talks at least until they see whether Mr. Bush wins the presidency and the Republicans maintain control of Congress.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At a minimum, the companies hope that Mr. Bush, who as governor of Texas has been a staunch defender of the industry and of gun owners, will help dampen the growing public sentiment for additional gun control.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Beyond that, their hope is that a President Bush would help push through Congress a bill outlawing municipal suits against them. As governor, Mr. Bush got just such a law through the State Legislature with the help of the National Rifle Association.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even if those hopes are unrealized, the companies calculate, Mr. Bush would at least stop the kind of pressure the Clinton administration has put on them through Andrew M. Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development, to settle the suits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry's trade organization, said he believed that as president Mr. Bush would work to pass a law protecting gun makers from municipal suits, ''based on his actions as governor of Texas,'' where he signed not only similar legislation but also a tort-reform measure curbing lawsuits against corporations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The industry is looking toward the election as a watershed event on this issue,'' Mr. Delfay said. ''If Bush wins, we could be going in a whole new direction.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Paul Januzzo, vice president and general counsel of one gun maker,  Glock Inc., acknowledged that settlement negotiations had come to a halt and that the industry was hoping for sympathy from a Bush administration. Mr. Januzzo said that the negotiations had ''degenerated into terrorism'' with escalating demands by the plaintiffs and that he no longer trusted their lawyers or Mr. Cuomo. He said the industry viewed Mr. Bush as ''anti-lawyer.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's camp has been noncommittal about whether he would back the kind of legislation the gun makers are seeking. Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman, declined to rule out the possibility, saying simply,  ''He has not addressed that at the federal level.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One big risk in the gun makers' November strategy, of course, is that  Mr. Bush could lose. In that case, the industry's best hope would lie in favorable treatment by judges. And so far, the industry is batting .500 with them:
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, a videotape obtained by Handgun Control Inc. and first reported in today's issue of The Washington Post shows a leading official of the rifle association telling members at a closed-door meeting in February that if Mr. Bush is elected, ''we'll have a president'' where ''we will work out of their office.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The official, Kayne Robinson, the association's first vice president and Iowa Republican chairman as well, also says on the tape that this is ''a critical election,'' in which a Bush victory will produce ''a Supreme Court that will back us to the hilt.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides to the Bush campaign did not immediately return phone calls last night about the video, although The Post quoted one campaign spokesman, Mr. McClellan, as saying that ''neither the N.R.A. nor any special interest sets the governor's agenda.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000

 <textdata>
  Short of enacting federal legislation, a Bush administration and a Republican-controlled Congress  could achieve the same ends through other means. One way would be to tie federal block grants for law enforcement to a condition that any city accepting the money not sue the gun companies. Federal law enforcement aid to cities and states has typically been through block grants, often with conditions attached. The Clinton administration, for example, has prided itself on providing money for the hiring of 100,000 police officers, who, under the program, were required to be assigned to community policing.

  Prolific fund-raisers and generous donors will also be invited to attend a private reception with Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore before the gala.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McAuliffe says he is trying to open the gala to thousands of young Democrats, who he says will pay $50 or $100 for tickets. The Democrats want to sell 14,000 arena tickets at prices from $50 to $1,000. And they have contrasted their event, which they say will encourage guests to wear blue jeans and cowboy boots, with the Republicans' black-tie affair last month in tribute to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the party's presumptive presidential nominee.
 </textdata>

  I'm worried, though, about what this will do to Al Gore and George W. Bush. Now that the bar has been raised so high, America will be looking for a major laugh riot talent in the next president of the United States.

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's battle against Mr. Bush is expected to be fierce in all four states that Mr. Clinton is visiting on this trip -- Mr. Bush recently ran an advertisement attacking the Clinton administration's education policies in Kentucky and Iowa.

  Gore finds its justification only in what it adds to game play, and when the novelty of blood-spouting necks wore off, I found myself wishing this advanced damage model had served as inspiration for other elements of the game.

  Another major problem would be money. One dirty little secret of the present system is that while it schedules primaries from January until June, the federal matching grant system does not provide money for a primary contest that lasts beyond April, when recent races have been over. Even the wealthy Bush campaign, which rejected public funding to avoid donation limits, would be flat broke if it were still buying television time today.

  The cardinal's failing health in recent months diminished his public appearances and his position as a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church, but it did not diminish his stature as one of its most powerful symbols on moral and political issues. When Gov. George W.

  BUSH SEEKS HELP -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas reached out yesterday for an experienced Republican hand, Andrew H. Card Jr., to watch over Bush interests at this summer's national convention in Philadelphia. Mr. Card, vice president for governmental relations for the General Motors Corporation, worked in the White House under President George Bush as deputy chief of staff and later was transportation secretary. He is the second member of the elder Bush's cabinet to join the governor's political organization in recent weeks. The first was Richard B. Cheney, President Bush's defense secretary, who was chosen to run the governor's vice presidential search committee.

  ABORTION RIGHTS ALERT -- The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League is promoting Vice President Al Gore with a television advertisement warning that if Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, is elected president, he will appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision. The commercials also warn that Mr. Bush ''even supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion.'' Mr. Bush is on record as saying that he will appoint justices who will ''strictly interpret'' the Constitution. Kate Michelman, president of the league, says many pro-rights supporters have been lulled into thinking that the right to a legal abortion is secure when, in fact, it is in danger because two or more supporters may leave the court in the next administration.

The report, adding information to previous reports of the crash, was released yesterday. Mrs. Bush is the wife of the Republican presidential nominee-to-be George W. Bush, the Texas governor. The report said Laura Welch was driving her Chevrolet sedan on a clear night shortly after 8 p.m. on Nov. 6, 1963, when she drove into an intersection and struck a car driven by her friend, 17-year-old Michael Douglas. No charges were filed.

  Gore and Bush Trade Barbs Over Policy and Style  Vice President Al Gore accused Gov. George W. Bush of devising a ''secret plan'' that could bankrupt the Social Security system. Hours later, Mr. Bush questioned the vice president's honesty and predicted that Mr. Gore's attacks would backfire.

  In a sharp exchange that gave the presidential campaign the intensity of a day in late October, Vice President Al Gore accused Gov. George W.

  ''How does the Bush plan propose to deal with the bankruptcy of Social Security that his privatization scheme would cause?'' Mr. Gore told a gathering of A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials in Atlantic City. ''He doesn't even bother to provide an answer. He just smiles and goes on with the smug assumption that there's no need to share with you the details of what he wants to do.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Responding to Mr. Gore's cascade of attacks, Mr. Bush spent much of a plane flight this afternoon from Austin, Tex., to Palm Springs, Calif., telling reporters that the vice president had flatly misrepresented his record on a host of issues, ranging from the Texas budget to his positions on China and Russia to his crime-fighting policies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Someone running for the highest office of the land should stick to the facts,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I think it is a pattern to say things, to stretch the truth. He's the man who said he invented the Internet.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked whether Mr. Gore's aggressive campaigning might work as well against him as it did against former Senator Bill Bradley during the Democratic primaries, Mr. Bush said he planned to respond faster and more forcefully than Mr. Bradley.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, rather than being aggrieved by his opponent's attacks, Mr. Bush seemed somewhat amused by the constant salvos from the vice president, suggesting that Mr. Gore's strategy was self-defeating.  ''Pretty soon, it's going to have a corrosive effect on his campaign if he's not telling the truth,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gore during the 78-minute airborne news conference. ''The fact that he relies on facts -- says things that are not factual -- are going to undermine his campaign.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's aides clearly disagree. Privately, they contend that the slashing strategy they employed during the primaries will work again in the general election, provided they avoid the appearance of attacking Mr. Bush personally.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also used his Atlantic City speech to discuss his own proposal for keeping the Social Security system solvent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I will devote all interest from debt reduction to shore up Social Security,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I think it is wrong to cut benefits, raise the retirement age or risk your retirement savings in a game of stock market roulette.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But that description amounted to one brief passage in a 35-minute speech that was devoted mainly to attacking Mr. Bush on a variety of fronts, particularly Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Under the proposal floated by Mr. Bush's aides in recent days, taxpayers would be allowed to invest a small part of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock or bond markets.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides argue that such a plan would help taxpayers take advantage of the stock market's historic growth.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore asserted today that the plan would make the system vulnerable to huge market fluctuations that could hurt millions of retirees. And as he has repeatedly done in recent days, he suggested that Mr. Bush was charting a course that was ''reckless'' and ''irresponsible.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''To me, Social Security is more than a government program,'' he said. ''It is a solemn compact between the generations.'' Governor Bush, he added, ''seems to believe differently.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore asserted that Mr. Bush had ''left the door wide open'' to raising the retirement age for Social Security as a means of bolstering the system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That approach, he argued, would be harmful to people who do strenuous manual labor and physically cannot postpone retirement. And he accused Mr. Bush of wanting to cut Social Security spending to pay for a tax cut that Mr. Gore argues would favor the rich.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides acknowledge that he has not ruled out raising the retirement age. But they note that he has not formulated a detailed plan yet, only the general principles for one. Those include not increasing Social Security taxes, not cutting benefits and setting aside the Social Security surplus in a ''lockbox'' to make sure it is used only on Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was Mr. Bush's lack of a detailed plan that caused Mr. Gore to accuse the Texas governor of devising a ''secret plan'' today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He wants to spring it on you after the election,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Well, I think he may be underestimating the capacity of the American people to figure out for ourselves what the details of his secret plan would mean for each and every American.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But if Mr. Gore's barbs were meant to rattle Mr. Bush, they failed. Indeed, what was extraordinary about today's exchange was the almost delighted mood that Mr. Bush brought to his end of it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was on his way to California for several days of campaigning, including a fund-raiser in Palm Springs tonight for the Republican Party that was expected to bring in about $1 million.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the flight, Mr. Bush revealed a few more glimmers than usual of his obvious distaste for what he seems to see as Mr. Gore's desperation to be president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Usually, Mr. Bush does a more thorough job of pulling his punches when he is asked what he thinks about Mr. Gore as a person.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After a reporter told Mr. Bush that Mr. Gore, whose first grandchild was born on the Fourth of July, sometimes says to Hispanic audiences that he hopes his second grandchild will be born on Cinco de Mayo, Mr. Bush muttered, ''Totally pathetic.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At another point, talking about his own desire for the presidency, Mr. Bush said: ''I'm willing to work for it. What I'm not willing to do is sell my soul to become the president.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked if Mr. Gore would do that, Mr. Bush arched an eyebrow and said, ''That's for you all to figure out.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush did not use the word ''lied,'' and when reporters did, he corrected them, coyly repeating again and again that he was simply setting the record straight and expressing his ''disappointment'' in Mr. Gore's behavior.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The vice president said I've never submitted a budget as governor of Texas'' said Mr. Bush, reciting the comments by Mr. Gore that he deemed untruthful. ''He talked about recidivism rates that were totally inaccurate numbers.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He said I called China and Russia enemies,'' Mr. Bush added. ''Have I ever referred to China and Russia as enemies?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush shook his head and veered toward what he clearly intended to be a kind of emotional and moral high ground.

  Will we roll the dice in the same casino economics that devastated our economy and hurt working families? Does anyone in this room think we should go back to the union-busting, job-destroying, budget-busting policies of the Bush-Quayle years. I don't think so. . . .

  There are deep and profound differences between Governor Bush and me. Not personal differences, but real differences on the issues.

  In both the Republican and Democratic parties, the presidential primaries this year were intense, competitive and, as a practical matter, over very quickly. Especially on the Republican side, there was a feeling that a more leisurely schedule would have given voters a better chance to think about the dramatic contrasts in style and message presented by Gov. George W. Bush and Senator John McCain. Now, a Republican Party commission led by Bill Brock, a former senator and party chairman, has put forward a plan to slow down the primary season so that it is more likely to last a full four months. This is a sound plan that ought to be adopted by the Republican National Convention this summer and copied by the Democrats, as well.

  In outlining her opposition to Mr. Bush's call for a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years, Mrs. Clinton said his plan would hurt efforts to win more federal money for New York because such broad-based tax reductions would deplete the surplus.

  ''I cannot support Governor Bush's large across-the-board tax cut,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I do not think that's right for New York or our country. The last thing we need right now before we can eliminate some of that deficit with Washington is a large across-the-board tax cut.''

  Monday was Decision Day for many high school seniors choosing colleges, but it came and went without so much as a peep from the Bush campaign about the destinations of Gov. George W. Bush's twin 18-year-old daughters, Barbara and Jenna.

  How far from home would they be straying? The Texas governor's aides were silent. What factors had the girls' final selection hinged on? Mum was the word. Aides acknowledged that the information would probably trickle out soon enough, through an unguarded utterance by Mr. Bush or an offhand comment by an official at one of the schools. But for just a bit longer, the family wanted to try to preserve the girls' privacy.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The Bush family has been remarkably successful at that, so much so that while Mr. Bush could become the next president and while his extended family is beginning to look an awful lot like a political dynasty, his two daughters are almost invisible, their faces unknown to 99.9 percent of voters outside Texas and their public sightings only slightly more frequent than Bigfoot's.

  ''From the time he was elected governor, we've had a policy that the girls are not interviewed and not photographed,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign and a senior adviser to Mr. Bush since 1994.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Far from being out of the ordinary, the daughters' anonymity immediately recalls that of Chelsea Clinton during her father's first presidential campaign, in 1992, and is shared to a degree by the three younger Gore children. (The oldest, Karenna Gore Schiff, 26, has a public role as an adviser to her father's presidential campaign.)

  Mr. Bush has similarly benefited from news organizations' voluntary restraint. Austin is not so big a place, and there are reporters whose children -- or whose friends' children -- attend the same public high school from which Barbara and Jenna Bush will be graduating this month. But the fruits of that familiarity have not found their way onto television or into newspapers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Similarly, Mr. Bush trusts reporters on his campaign plane to be cognizant of, and to respect, his wishes that his daughters remain journalistically off-limits, and he thus talks somewhat freely about them on occasion and even mentioned, several times, the kinds of colleges each daughter was considering.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The personal-biography section of Mr. Bush's Web site digresses to mention, ''Governor and Mrs. Bush have worked hard to protect their daughters' privacy. They attend public school in Austin but do not give interviews and only appear at public events if they want to.''
 </textdata>
    <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In public, Mr. Bush walks a carefully but not always consistently drawn line. He sporadically delights audiences with a fleeting, vague riff on the agonies and ecstasies of fatherhood and repeatedly mentions that Barbara and Jenna go to a public high school. But he generally furnishes no more specifics about them than about the family's six-toed cat, Ernie.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There are exceptions to this reticence, the most conspicuous one being a chapter of his autobiography, ''A Charge to Keep'' (William Morrow &amp; Company, 1999), in which Mr. Bush discusses his support for the death penalty. He divulges that one daughter -- he does not say which -- told him over the dinner table that she disagrees with him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, have said repeatedly that they want Barbara and Jenna, fraternal twins who are the couple's only children, to be affected by their father's political celebrity as little as possible.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And they behaved as teenagers typically do, bowing to the latest pop-cultural fashions and sometimes remarking on how unfashionable their father was. In interviews with Texas journalists in the past, Mrs. Bush bemoaned that the girls's television-watching habits, at least a few years ago, included ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Melrose Place,'' and noted that they would sometimes stop their father before he walked out the door, questioning his choice of attire.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even as a governor's children, they were not constantly escorted or monitored by guards, but security around the entire family tightened earlier this year with the arrival of the Secret Service, much to the girls chagrin, an aide to Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  According to the aide and several of Mr. Bush's friends, the girls' low public profile reflects their own desires as much as their parents' efforts. For example, Barbara and Jenna Bush briefly considered accompanying their parents to the polls in Texas for the Republican primary; it was, after all, the first election cycle in which the girls were old enough to vote.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One of Mr. Bush's advisers said Barbara and Jenna Bush had learned early on that even the most seemingly harmless exposure could yield accidental humiliation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  About six years ago, when a television crew shot footage of the Bushes decorating their Christmas tree, the telephone rang and Mr. Bush joked that it might be a boy who liked Jenna. When the story was broadcast, it included both that comment and Jenna's mortified reaction.

  But the grades have also been used for more drastic measures. Florida legislators voted to give private-school vouchers to students at schools that receive F's for two years out of four. the state is appealing a court decision that ruled the vouchers, but not the grading, unconstitutional. In a speech outlining his presidential campaign pledges on education, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas proposed grading all schools and stripping some federal financing from those that received low grades for three years.

  It has become the daily tit for tat of the presidential contest. Vice President Al Gore calls Gov. George W. Bush reckless, irresponsible, profligate or arrogant. And Mr. Bush calmly replies that the vice president is like an addict when it comes to distorting the truth.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If this kind of acrid exchange seems vaguely familiar, there is good reason: During the Democratic primary campaign, Mr. Gore relentlessly attacked the proposals of former Senator Bill Bradley as risky and expensive. And Mr. Bradley calmly replied that the vice president was addicted to distorting the truth.

  Many people have their doubts. Though it may seem logical for Mr. Gore to try to bathe his less well known opponent in a negative light, the strategy carries clear risks, say independent analysts and some Democrats as well.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For one thing, Mr. Gore is now playing to an audience very different from that of the primary campaign. Back then he was talking to largely sympathetic crowds of Democrats. Now he must court swing voters who are likely to be more skeptical of his credibility and less accepting of his attacks on Mr. Bush. Taken too far, the attacks could make him appear unpleasant, overly partisan, mean-spirited and untrustworthy to the very independent and crossover voters he is courting.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even some Democrats seem to think that Mr. Gore's attacks occasionally go over the top. On Wednesday, Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of devising a ''secret'' Social Security ''privatization'' plan that would bankrupt the system. Today Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who supports investing some of the Social Security trust fund in private markets, took issue with the word ''privatization.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another danger for Mr. Gore is that voters will perceive his criticisms of Mr. Bush as personal. Mr. Gore's aides argue that his attacks are aimed solely at Mr. Bush's record and proposals. (Today alone, the vice president blasted Mr. Bush's positions on the census, managed care and gun control.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the adjectives the vice president has used in describing Mr. Bush's policies -- ''reckless,'' ''risky,'' ''irresponsible,'' ''smug,'' ''arrogant,'' ''noticeably blank'' -- also seem intended to raise questions about the governor's character, intellect and competence, many analysts say.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They note that Mr. Gore used similarly loaded words against Mr. Bradley, suggesting that he was an aloof elitist who viewed politics as ''an intellectual exercise.'' The Gore campaign seems to be trying to exploit the opposite with Mr. Bush, who, unlike Mr. Bradley, a Rhodes scholar, is viewed by his critics as lacking intellectual depth on complex issues, particularly foreign affairs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said today that he was not particularly worried that he  might be creating negative impressions among voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And he defended his recent use of the words ''smug'' and ''arrogant,'' turning away a suggestion that they had been meant to convey something about Mr. Bush's character.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''They're a commentary on the assumption that is at the heart of his campaign: that you as journalists and the American people as voters are not entitled to know the details of his private secret plan to privatize Social Security,'' Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Democratic strategists argue that Mr. Gore may have little choice but to attack so vigorously and so early in the campaign, as he did against Mr. Bradley. For one thing, he is trailing Mr. Bush, although by small margins, in most polls, including those in customarily Democratic states like Washington and West Virginia. And because he is so well known, many voters already hold relatively fixed opinions of him, as many bad as good, most polls show.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In contrast, Mr. Bush, despite his famous name, remains something of a mystery to voters outside Texas. So Mr. Gore, the reasoning goes, needs to define his rival as a risky, out-of-the-mainstream alternative. That was the very strategy that Mr. Bush's father, also a two-term vice president at the time, used with  great success 12 years ago against another governor running for president, Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If you become viewed as a risk, as Michael Dukakis was in 1988, it is a very tough road to get back from,'' said Susan Estrich, who managed Mr. Dukakis's campaign. ''If Al Gore can raise questions about Bush, Bush may never get off the ground. So Gore will just keep doing it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Ms. Estrich praised Mr. Bush's ability to roll with Mr. Gore's punches and, in the process, make him seem like a negative politician. ''It seems to be working,'' she said of the governor's approach. ''He's up.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In adopting Mr. Bradley's strategy of calling Mr. Gore dishonest, Bush aides have also appropriated one of Mr. Bradley's sharpest debate lines, which they often strip across news releases: ''Why should we believe you would tell the truth as president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush is also a candidate far different from Mr. Bradley, with a campaign quicker in its responses to the vice president's blasts. On Tuesday, for instance, Mr. Gore asserted that criminal recidivism rates in Texas had increased significantly during the Bush administration; within hours, Mr. Bush's press office had issued its own statistics rebutting the charge. Mr. Bradley's campaign sometimes let days go by before responding to attacks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And on Wednesday, after Mr. Gore's Social Security attack, Mr. Bush spent much of a flight to California giving reporters a spirited, point-by-point response to many of Mr. Gore's recent accusations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That high-altitude news conference underscored what many Republicans say are Mr. Bush's greatest  strengths as a campaigner: his sunny persona, his humor and his ability to cloak tart retorts in genial language. Those traits, Republicans say, make Mr. Gore seem all the more stiff and mean-spirited by comparison.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''By going into attack mode so early, and by repeating this mantra that everything Bush proposes is a risky scheme, Al Gore plays into George Bush's hands on the personality comparison,'' said Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster. ''George Bush comes across in that case as a likable, decent guy, and Al Gore comes across as a whining, yapping little dog.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet there is a certain logic, some analysts say, to Mr. Gore's efforts at harshly undermining Mr. Bush, and doing so sooner rather than later.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Gore didn't stop Bradley's forward momentum overnight,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. ''You have to lay the groundwork.

  ''Some Strong Words About Bush''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In recent weeks Vice President Al Gore has used a variety of derisive words, including ''risky,'' ''irresponsible,'' ''smug'' and ''reckless,'' to characterize the proposals of Gov. George W. Bush. Here is a sampling.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MARCH 16 -- ''Governor Bush's tax scheme is so risky, so reckless, that just yesterday the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, given an opportunity to vote for it, turned it down, turned the other way, said, 'We don't want to even cast a vote on that thing.' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  APRIL 30 -- ''Just this past week, Governor Bush used his brief meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov to issue a warning that his intention would be to build and deploy a global Star Wars system that he believes could defend the U.S. and all our allies against any missile launch from any source. In the 1990's, most serious analysts took a look at the implausibility of this endeavor, the fantastical price that our taxpayers would be expected to pay and the dangerously destabilizing consequences of traveling down that path and rejected this notion. Governor Bush wishes to return to it, and chose the worst possible venue in which to launch, for lack of a better phrase, his risky foreign policy scheme.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MAY 3 -- ''How does the Bush plan propose to deal with the bankruptcy of Social Security that his privatization scheme would cause? He doesn't even bother to provide an answer. He just smiles and goes on with the smug assumption that there's no need to share with you the details of what he wants to do.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Vice President Al Gore continued his intensive assault against Gov. George W. Bush's policies today, saying his Republican rival had been inordinately influenced by the National Rifle Association and had proposed an inadequate health care plan that ''offers too little for too few at the expense of too many.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But when asked later by reporters about Mr. Bush's comments that Mr. Gore's attacks were having a corrosive influence on the political process, Mr. Gore refused to respond directly, saying the nation deserved a vigorous debate on the issues.

 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore had intended to deliver a health care speech here, since he was addressing the inaugural meeting of the Association of Health Care Journalists, at Northwestern University Memorial Hospital.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But his aides said he had been captivated by reports in the morning newspapers that suggested that the gun lobby was thrilled at the prospect of a Bush presidency, and Mr. Gore rewrote his speech as he flew here this morning from Washington to draw attention to those reports.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The New York Times reported that gun manufacturers had broken off settlement talks with 31 cities and counties in hopes that a Bush administration would be more sympathetic than the Clinton administration has been. And The Washington Post reported that Kayne Robinson, first vice president of the N.R.A., had said in a speech to members in February that if Mr. Bush was elected, the gun lobby would expect to have ''a president where we work out of their office.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Handgun Control Inc., a lobbying group, began running a 30-second television commercial today that uses videotape of the speech and attacks Mr. Bush as a pawn of the National Rifle Association.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his speech, Mr. Gore said, ''Governor Bush has convinced the N.R.A. that he wants to take the gun lobbyists out of the lobby and put them right into the Oval Office.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's point was that gun violence, apart from killing people, was straining the nation's health care system, to the tune of $2.3 billion annually, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association, and that Mr. Bush was so deeply in the pocket of the gun lobby that he could not recognize this problem.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush dismissed those accusations. ''I make my positions on what I think is right,'' he said at a news conference in Orange County, Calif. ''If this is an attempt by my opponent to frighten people, I'm not going to let that happen.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked about Mr. Robinson's speech, Mr. Bush said: ''I don't want to disappoint the man, but I'll be setting up shop in the White House. It'll be my office. I'll make the decision as to what goes on in the White House.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Repeating an accusation he has made before, Mr. Bush said: ''I want to say something: I've never been a member of the N.R.A. I think Al Gore's been a member of the N.R.A., if I'm not mistaken.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This accusation momentarily befuddled both campaigns, neither of which could find evidence that Mr. Gore had belonged to the gun lobby. Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said the governor might have been referring to a Time magazine article this year that quoted an N.R.A. official as saying Mr. Gore, who represented rural Tennessee in Congress, had once been so opposed to gun control that he could have been the poster boy for it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked whether Mr. Bush had misspoken, Mr. McClellan said, ''I'll leave it at that.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said: ''The campaign has no record of Al Gore being a member of the N.R.A.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gore aides said Mr. Gore might have inadvertently become a member through a magazine subscription or some other organization.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The burden of proof is on Bush,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''He ought to be held to the same standards on distortions that you guys are holding the Gore campaign to.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush again said Mr. Gore was distorting his record and ''saying things that simply are not true.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's amazing that a person running for president of the United States would look people in the eye and say I've never submitted budgets as governor and continue to say so when I did,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At a news conference, Mr. Gore declined to respond to Mr. Bush's accusations that he was not being factual. But the vice president, who has said Mr. Bush has never put together a real budget, brought that up again. He said he happened to have in his pocket what he said was a copy of Mr. Bush's 1995 budget. He handed it to a reporter, saying, ''If you think that's a budget, then maybe I can convince you it's a duck.''

  Praise for the cardinal came from President Clinton, Gov. George E. Pataki, the Rev. Billy Graham, the presidential rivals Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, the Senate rivals Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and many others. In general they were much the same, with phrases about the cardinal's ''eloquent voice,'' and ''courage, selflessness and devotion to duty.''

  Al Gore delivered a provocative foreign policy speech Sunday that raised an important question: Does George W. Bush have the experience, the gravitas and, by implication, the brains to run U.S. foreign policy?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If not, said Mr. Gore, one can only assume that ''the gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership.''

  Al Gore delivered a provocative foreign policy speech Sunday that raised an important question: Does George W. Bush have the experience, the gravitas and, by implication, the brains to run U.S. foreign policy?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If not, said Mr. Gore, one can only assume that ''the gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now this is a legitimate question. Mr. Bush has no experience in foreign policy, the well-displayed gaps in his knowledge suggest he may not have even read the newspaper much, and this could make him easy prey for the foreign policy ideologues in his party.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in raising this question Mr. Gore, inadvertently, raises a question about himself -- a question that many people who respect him have been asking. If you talk to Al Gore about geopolitics, the Internet or the global economy, you leave feeling he really does get it. But what good are brains if you don't always act on them? Mr. Bush may not have the brains to always do the right thing, but does Mr. Gore have the spine?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Most of Mr. Gore's speech was a serious appeal for an activist, internationalist U.S. foreign policy -- something that, in fairness, Mr. Bush would also pursue. So what was legitimate in Mr. Gore's critique of Mr. Bush? It's the charge that the internationalism Mr. Bush offers often sounds like a we-will-do-whatever-we-want-because-we're-the-only-superpower-and-I-am-not-a-wimp-like-Clinton set of policies, which, if adopted at once, could be destabilizing and would have virtually no allied support. The best thing you can say is that Mr. Bush doesn't really mean some of this stuff. But what if he does?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If it were his father, the former president, you know that he would do the prudent thing. But we don't know that with George W., and when you look at his own party's willingness to be led around by the fringe views of Jesse Helms, well, Mr. Gore is right to ask: Is George W. his father's son or his advisers' captive?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But as for Mr. Gore, in his speech he called for a foreign policy of ''forward engagement'' -- addressing problems early before they become a crisis and doing so ''as close to the source of the problem as possible.'' Well, I can think of no problem more in need of such forward engagement than the U.S. embargo of Fidel Castro's Cuba, which has failed for 40 years to oust the Cuban dictator and, if continued, is only going to ensure that when Castro dies the Cuban economy collapses, civil war breaks out and thousands of Cubans sail for Miami. Fixing that policy means engaging the hard-line Miami Cubans, who want no change in policy, but as Mr. Gore showed in the Elian case, that sort of tough love is not his thing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Elian was not a one-day story. It was one of those moments when you get to see everyone's character: Attorney General Janet Reno stood her ground. Mr. Bush said what his advisers told him to say. And Mr. Gore tried to both exploit the Elian saga for political advantage and hide from it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his speech, Mr. Gore decried ''protectionism and isolationism,'' but when union-led demonstrators were disrupting the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle in the name of more protectionism, Mr. Gore was silent. What good is it to be for things in principle if you won't take them on in practice? I know Mr. Gore has cast tough votes before. I know he has to get elected. But the growing trend in the Clinton years was that the campaign never ends. This administration has not given a Sister Souljah speech to anyone in a long, long time.

  That's why the best you can say today about Governor Bush on foreign policy is that he doesn't really mean it, and won't do the wrong thing. He'll wise up. And the best you can say about Al Gore is that he really does mean it and will do the right thing. He'll stand up. But both still have something to prove.

  BUSH VOWS FIGHT IN CALIFORNIA -- On the second of what will amount to at least four swings through California this spring, Gov. George W. Bush insisted yesterday that he was determined to fight for the state's 54 electoral votes and would not repeat the actions of the last two Republican presidential nominees, who made an early show of interest in California and then effectively ceded it toward the end of the campaign. ''I intend to campaign all the way through November here,'' Mr. Bush said in Mission Viejo, where he visited a charter school. Although Mr. Bush rarely edges up to anything resembling a criticism of his father, former President George Bush, who lost his re-election bid in 1992, the Texas governor said on Wednesday that one reason Republicans had hit hard times in California was that the party's presidential nominees in 1992 and 1996 had abandoned any hope of winning the state.

  READ MY LIPS: NO SMIRK -- California was not the only place where Gov. George W. Bush discussed his father's presidential campaigns. In an ABC News interview to be broadcast today, he says his father seriously undermined his credibility by breaking the ''read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge that had helped him win the White House in 1988. The Texas governor, who himself has taken a no-new-taxes pledge, says the switch helped lead to his father's defeat by Bill Clinton. As for President Clinton, Mr. Bush sharply criticizes his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. ''He and Mrs. Clinton have done a great job with their daughter, no question about it,'' Mr. Bush says. ''But Bill Clinton, unfortunately, in the last chapter of the 20th century, embarrassed our nation.''  Mr. Bush gave Vice President Al Gore credit for being ''a loving husband and a good dad.'' But he says he is ''a little worried about a man who tends to stretch the truth in order to get ahead politically.''  And what of criticism of himself, especially the charge that he wears a habitual smirk? ''I find a great irony in life and I find humor,'' he replies. ''And I find it amazing that people would spend time analyzing whether I was smiling or not, as opposed to what my views are on education or keeping the economy strong or cutting taxes.''

  ''I'll speak out about it,'' Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said aboard his campaign plane Wednesday afternoon, referring to the vote.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked if he would phone individual Republicans who were undecided, Mr. Bush first said he doubted it, then added, ''I shouldn't say categorically no.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Several aides to Mr. Bush said the possibility of such calls had been discussed by Republican officials on Capitol Hill and some of the governor's advisers in Austin, Tex., but that nothing had been decided.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But one aide to Mr. Bush said the governor was wary of doing anything, on any issue, that resembled outright lobbying, because such actions might appear inappropriate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It could work to Mr. Bush's advantage to sway them, because it would demonstrate that his calls for more open trade with China have not fallen on deaf ears in his own party. Moreover, it would show he can exert leadership over Republicans and promote cohesiveness among them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush has almost equal reason not to push too hard. Should the measure fail, its loss would owe more to Democratic opposition than Republican and would give Mr. Bush another issue with which to beat Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who also supports it.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush could argue that the Clinton administration -- and by extension Mr. Gore -- could not win enough Congressional cooperation to pass any meaningful legislation, political analysts said.

 <textdata>
  Indeed, discussing the vote aboard his campaign jet, Mr. Bush tried to shift the topic from his plans to those of Mr. Gore. Referring to telephoning members of Congress, Mr. Bush said: ''The interesting question is, Will Vice President Gore? Because it's his administration that's trying to get the bill through.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Several House Republican aides said that Mr. Bush would probably not be asked to approach individual Republicans, because House Republicans already knew where the governor stood on the issue and would have factored that into their deliberations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Not one member has said, 'Is Governor Bush with us? I could use a call' '' one House aide said. ''But if a member says it would be really helpful to get a call from Governor Bush, we'd ask him, and we're confident he'd say yes.''

  Right after the three senators spoke, two other Democratic senators, Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota and Charles E. Schumer of New York, held their own news conference to criticize Mr. Bush's interest in including individual investment accounts as an element of overhauling Social Security.

  Mr. Gore has put paying down the $3.5 trillion national debt at the center of his economic agenda. That would reduce the federal government's interest payments. He proposes to keep Social Security solvent through 2050 by allocating the interest savings to the retirement system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is to speak next week on Social Security and include a call for putting some portion of payroll taxes into private accounts. Under this approach, part of the retirement benefit would be guaranteed and part would fluctuate with individual investment decisions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked about the commission today, Mr. Gore dismissed the idea, saying: ''These commissions are in the eye of the beholder. I disagree with them, and agree instead with the great majority of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House who are not for privatization of Social Security.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. McCain met on Sunday for about 20 minutes with Mr. Gore at the Naval Observatory in Washington, the vice president's official residence. Both were appearing on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' which was being filmed at the residence. When Mr. Gore learned on Saturday that Mr. McCain would be under his own roof on Sunday, he called the Arizona senator and invited him to come over early for a private chat.

  ''We're friends,'' Mr. Gore told reporters later, noting that the two had served in the House and Senate together. ''It's not that complicated.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said he understood that Mr. McCain, who has suspended his own presidential campaign, would be endorsing Mr. Bush, a fellow Republican, for president. But ever since Mr. Gore locked up the Democratic nomination, he has been invoking Mr. McCain's name and making an overt play for his independent-minded supporters.

  On Sunday night, Mr. Gore seemed eager to fill reporters in on the details of their get-together, uncharacteristically allowing camera crews to film him on his airplane discussing the matter as he flew from Boston to Washington.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said the two discussed campaign finance reform, Mr. McCain's signature issue and one that Mr. Gore is advancing in his campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has said the McCain-Feingold proposal to eliminate so-called soft money from campaigns would be his No. 1 domestic initiative, a move some critics suspect is an effort to inoculate himself against criticism that his own fund-raising has been too aggressive. The Sunday session thus struck some as an effort by Mr. Gore to bask in Mr. McCain's credibility on the issue, or what the political columnist Mark Shields calls ''innocence by association.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president also wanted to signal that he could work with Republicans, a theme that Mr. Bush has emphasized recently while suggesting that Mr. Gore was excessively partisan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I will regularly and routinely reach across party lines,'' Mr. Gore said on Sunday night, adding that his ''natural instincts'' were to work in a bipartisan manner.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore went even further in this direction by suggesting, in answer to a question, that he might even name a Republican as his vice president. ''I think that's unlikely,'' he said, but ''I would not rule it out.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While the cameras were still rolling, Mr. Gore also poked fun at his own comments about the Elian Gonzalez case, which has caused him much political heartache.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the biggest laugh came when Mr. Gore referred to a ''bit part'' that he had played in a well-received video that President Clinton had made to show at the annual White House correspondents' dinner on Saturday night.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A reporter on the plane remembered that Mr. Gore had made a brief appearance in the video but said, ''I've forgotten what it was,'' inadvertently summarizing Mr. Gore's longtime difficulty in establishing himself outside Mr. Clinton's shadow.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Administration officials used the news to strengthen their claim to being a force for fiscal prudence and the guardian of economic expansion. They sought to contrast their focus on debt reduction to calls from Republicans, who have a majority in Congress, and from Gov. George W.

  Maybe the only thing to do is go national. Next time Al Gore or George Bush comes to your town, ask him what he'd do to crack down on hog lagoons. One of them might have an answer, and at least it might liven things up.

  My question is, if Governor Bush has accomplished little as Texas's chief executive, how is he qualified to serve as president of the United States? Basically, he is running without any track record. Perhaps if his name weren't Bush, he would just be one of the also-rans who took part in this year's Republican primaries.

  It may shock Ms. Birch, but lots of gays oppose Mr. Gore and resent being taken for granted by the Democratic Party. Like the millions of ordinary Americans of all backgrounds, we middle-of-the-road gays are still outraged by the scandals and immorality of the present administration, and we yearn for a return to decency, honesty and virtue in the White House.

  Last week, for example, the Republican National Committee brought in $21.3 million -- the most ever raised in a single event -- at its  gala in Washington saluting the party's apparent presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. The Republicans received six-figure contributions -- and fund-raising assistance -- from Philip Morris, AT&amp;T and the National Rifle Association, all three of which are among the most generous soft-money contributors to the party this year. The Democrats hope  to raise a similar amount at a tribute to President Clinton later this month.

  The governor has used the money to raise his profile nationally. He has hired nationally known political consultants like Benjamin L.

  If there were Gore supporters in the crowd, they were not admitting it publicly. Just about everyone interviewed said they would vote for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Mr. Bush has been a strong ally of the N.R.A. in Texas, but recently he has tried to put some distance between himself and the organization, clearly aware that he needs to win the votes of some moderate Democrats and independents in November.
 </textdata>

  A GETAWAY FOR THE GORES -- Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, escaped Washington yesterday to spend their 30th wedding anniversary at Bethany Beach in Delaware. The Gores were staying at the beach home of Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's presidential campaign chairman, through Sunday. The couple took a Marine helicopter at taxpayer expense -- a requirement of the Secret Service, a spokesman said. Accompanying them were Mr. Gore's Secret Service detail, a military aide and a press aide, although the White House had not notified reporters of the vice president's travel until yesterday afternoon, after the Gores had left Washington. Mr. Gore last month had told reporters covering his presidential campaign that he would notify them when he traveled, including on his anniversary. ''I will err on the side of openness and full access as much as possible,'' he said. But he apparently had not shared this decision with his wife, who has said she hopes to maintain her family's privacy even if her husband becomes president and in a recent interview questioned why reporters would need to accompany the vice president on private trips.

  BUSH IN KENTUCKY -- Wending his way across Kentucky on a campaign bus, Gov. George W. Bush took his ''compassionate conservatism'' on the road yesterday, calling on the elderly to volunteer. At a center for the elderly in Paducah, Mr. Bush praised retired volunteers who share ''wisdom, experience and values'' as foster grandparents or mentors. He proposed to increase federal financing for such volunteer programs from $183 million a year to $240 million annually across five years. Some of the money would go to a pilot program, under which 10,000 low-income elderly volunteers would earn a $1,000 scholarship for a grandchild or a child of their choice.

  GORE WEB SITE ATTACKS BUSH PLAN -- Certain that Governor Bush has handed them the perfect campaign weapon with his Social Security proposal, the Gore campaign unveiled a new Web site this week devoted to attacking his plan. Its not-so-subtle address: www.bushinsecurity.com. The home page features a photograph of rolling dice (Mr. Gore likes to accuse Mr. Bush of promoting ''casino economics'') and a picture of a slightly crazed-looking Mr. Bush over the caption, ''When he was asked if people could lose money under his plan, Bush replied, 'Maybe, maybe not.'' Asked to respond to the Web site, Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said, ''Having invented the Internet, you would have thought Al Gore could have used it for something positive and not just another attack barrage.'' He added that he would check the site to see whether it included a link to the White House Web site that promotes the Clinton administration's proposal to invest Social Security money in the stock market, an idea Mr. Gore once supported.

  Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida is currently embroiled in a fight over an executive order that outlaws race-based admissions at the state universities -- while guaranteeing admissions to the top 20 percent of high school classes. Mr. Bush's order was meant to render moot a ballot initiative on affirmative action that Republicans feared would heighten black turnout in this year's presidential election. The 20 percent rule seemed non-controversial and even generous -- until Governor Bush found that roughly two-thirds of additional black students who might benefit from the rule had been so neglected in high school that they had failed to graduate with the necessary credits for admission to the state university system. The state is now pushing public schools that serve black students to provide better course offerings.

  Although Mr. Bush has long favored free trade, his address here today on the vast factory floor of a Boeing plant marked one of the very few times that he has tried publicly to affect pending legislation in Congress. He called next week's House vote ''among the most serious decisions our government will make this year.'' And he said ''no one serious about shouldering the responsibilities of the Presidency'' should remain silent.

  Calling trade relations with China the work of ''13 years and three administrations,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas today urged Congressional Republicans and Democrats alike to support President Clinton and vote next week to grant China permanent trade rights.

  ''From the start of this campaign I have defined some sharp differences with the Clinton-Gore administration,'' Mr. Bush said, a sleek Boeing 777 behind him. ''But today I want to address an important area of agreement. A pressing question now confronts the Congress and it will not wait until the next president takes office.''

  Mr. Bush drew some sharp distinctions between himself and Vice President Al Gore on China. But he portrayed the quest for a more open China, advanced through trade and the rule of law, as one that Presidents of both parties had fought for.

  ''This is not a Republican or Democratic concern,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It is an American concern. This trade agreement is the work of 13 years and three administrations. We cannot let that work be undone.'' He did not mention his father by name, although he was one of those Presidents. But he quoted Ronald Reagan, who called free trade ''a forward strategy for freedom.''

  With his remarks, Mr. Bush put himself in a tradition of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy that has increasingly been eroded in recent years. And the speech was just the latest example of his efforts to portray himself as leader willing to reach across party lines.

  Mr. Bush made his speech in a region of the country that has been at the epicenter of the debate over trade. While Washington is oriented toward exports, nearby Seattle was also the site of last year's violent protests against the World Trade Organization.

  The vast Boeing plant itself showcased those divisions. The company is the nation's largest exporter, but a number of its workers said they feared China's entry into the World Trade Organization would ultimately cost Americans jobs. Indeed the area's Congressman, Representative Jack Metcalf is one of the few Republicans who are undecided on the issue. Mr. Bush, on his campaign plane this afternoon, said that he had made no telephone calls to wavering house members, but would do so if Representative Tom DeLay, the majority whip, asked for his help.

  The state of Washington has voted Democratic in the last three presidential elections, but Mr. Bush's aides say they are contesting the state. The employees at the Boeing plant gave Mr. Bush a generally polite reception. He drew applause and a few boos. A long line of workers waited to meet him and shake his hand after the speech.

  Mr. Gore has supported the bill, but has been less fervent than the President, trying to avoid the wrath of organized labor, a critical Democratic constituency.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, today Mr. Bush seemed a more enthusiastic ally to Mr. Clinton on the China bill than did Mr. Gore.  Saying that ''the stakes are high,'' he argued passionately for the House to approve China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He did, however, use the occasion to draw distinctions between the Administration's approach to China and trade and his own. He said Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore view China as a ''strategic partner'' and said, ''I view China as a competitor.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also accused the administration of being inconsistent in its approach to Taiwan. And he charged that it had bungled various high- profile battles over trade. ''They failed to obtain 'fast track' trade negotiating authority,'' Mr. Bush said, ''I will fight for it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said that while China is not a ''strategic partner,'' it is not an enemy. ''When I am the President China will have no doubts about our power and purpose in the region -- about our strong commitment to democratic allies throughout Asia,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Boeing workers were divided on the issue. Before Mr. Bush spoke Jon J. Walker, 46, a tool maker, said he opposed normal trade with China because it would result in the loss of American manufacturing jobs. ''We know that labor is cheaper elsewhere,'' he said. ''We can't compete with somebody who's living in a  cardboard box.'' He said he was a Democrat who would vote for Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>

  Afterward, Charles Webb, 42, a mechanic, said that he was a unionized worker who does not ''follow the union line.'' But he said he was uncertain about China trade because ''I'm not confident with China's human rights record.'' He took a dim view of both candidates. ''I'm not going to vote for Gore -- that's a definite,'' Mr. Webb said. ''Vote for Mr. Bush? I'd prefer not to. But that may be my only choice.''

  Mr. Lindsey, who strongly favors Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus, has warned his private clients of a potential stock market tailspin that could lead to a recession. He said he sold his own stocks about two years ago so he would be able ''to sleep at night.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-18-2000

 <textdata>
  The other signal came Monday when Mr. Bush told the nation that the key to saving Social Security retirement benefits was to allow working Americans to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in the very same stock market that Mr. Lindsey, at the moment, wants no part of.

  ''What Bush is doing is taking a guaranteed system that is indexed to inflation and shifting a portion of those benefits to a non-guaranteed, non-indexed system that's based on the luck of the stock market,'' said Roger Hickey, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future, a progressive policy organization in Washington.

  Even if Mr. Bush's bet is right -- that over the next several years the stock market will do better than most other investments -- there will still be many unfortunate wage earners finding themselves at retirement time on the wrong end of this big policy stick.

  There is, however, a group of guaranteed winners under Mr. Bush's plan -- the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have been funneling many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of Mr. Bush and other politicians, just begging them to steer some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security taxes their way.

  BUSH ENDORSED AS REAGAN'S HEIR  Nancy Reagan endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for president yesterday, claiming him as an heir to the conservative political tradition of her husband, former President Ronald Reagan. ''His agenda of tax cuts, smaller government and a strong national defense will build pride in America just as it did when my husband was president,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ''This is a candidate Ronnie would be proud of.'' Mr. Reagan, 89, has Alzheimer's disease and no longer makes public appearances or statements. Mrs. Reagan has offered her endorsement of every Republican presidential candidate since her husband left office in 1988. Mr. Bush proudly embraced the Reagan mantle. ''I thank her for her endorsement and pledge an optimistic, positive campaign, in the Reagan tradition, to renew America's spirit and encourage a new era of personal responsibility and freedom,'' Mr. Bush said.

  THE VOTE IS IN THE MAIL  Unable to affect the presidential nominating contests at this late point, Oregon voters used Tuesday's vote-by-mail primary, the nation's first, to reject ballot proposals calling for a new gasoline tax and limits on damages in personal-injury lawsuits. Oregon residents have voted by mail in local elections and special statewide elections since the early 1980's, but they had never before voted entirely by mail in a regularly scheduled election. A footnote: Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Bush won going away, as expected, not that it made any difference in the nominating contests. And the turnout? The secretary of state's office put it at 47 percent, the highest since the 1992 primary, when turnout hit 49.1 percent.

  Democrats have sought to portray Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican candidate, as mired in a narrow military vision of national security no longer appropriate in a post-cold-war world.

  While respondents agreed that voters had little influence over either party's choice, they had different explanations of who made the Republican and Democratic decisions. For Mr. Bush, the public thought campaign money was most important, while for Mr. Gore, they said it was the support of party leaders. Both judgments reflected the attention those factors drew during the nomination contests.
 </textdata>

  5-18-2000

  While 21 percent said the voters had the most influence in picking Mr. Bush, 26 percent said party leaders were decisive, and 44 percent credited his success to ''people who contributed money.''

  About half of those surveyed said they were satisfied with the candidates who emerged, while half said they wanted more choices. People who said they would vote for Mr. Bush were slightly more content; 58 percent of them said they were satisfied with the choices now, compared with 52 percent of Mr. Gore's supporters.

  The dismay came through in some  follow-up interviews. Jane Marawar, a homemaker in Austin, Tex., said, ''It's important to vote, but money seems to be running the election process.'' Mrs. Marawar, a Democrat, said she did not vote in the Texas primary on March 14, a week after Mr. Gore was credited with wrapping up the nomination. By then, she said, ''the die was cast.''

  ''You shouldn't be asked to play stock market roulette with your retirement savings in the Social Security program,'' Mr. Gore told several thousand people at a convention of AARP, an organization of people 50 and older. ''You shouldn't be left without retirement security if you do. And you should not have to foot the bill for others who do play and happen to lose, because some people would lose. The Bush plan raises all of these possibilities.''

  Mr. Gore also seized on remarks by Mr. Bush on Tuesday, when the Republican governor of Texas suggested that his proposal might be just a first step toward allowing workers to invest most or all of their payroll taxes.

  Saying that Mr. Bush has not ruled out the possibility of future benefit cuts, Mr. Gore added, ''I don't think your Social Security should be up for grabs, and under my plan, it won't be.''

  Mr. Gore contends that the best way to strengthen the system is to use the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt, and then devote the interest savings to the system. The plan, he says, would not only prolong Social Security's solvency until 2054, but also keep interest rates down and sustain the economic boom.

  Mr. Bush has also tried to make the debate as much about character as about policy, arguing that Mr. Gore has shown himself to lack credibility, consistency and vision on this and other issues.
 </textdata>

  5-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign hammered at that theme again today, releasing material from a White House Web site in which Mr. Gore is said to have supported a proposal last year by the Clinton administration to invest some Social Security money ''to achieve higher returns.''

  ''Whether the issue is abortion, gun control, medical marijuana and now Social Security, Al Gore has a history of changing his position for political gain. That's why he has a problem with credibility.''

  Mr. Bush's aides said his comments today about the Clinton administration's position on the matter had been prompted by the United States mission's sponsoring a news conference in March by Catholics for Free Choice, a group seeking a review of the Vatican's status.

  An aide to Mr. Bush who briefed reporters at the governor's campaign headquarters here said a Bush administration would not have given Catholics for Free Choice access to the United Nations. But this aide  spoke on the condition that he not be identified. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the campaign, was less definitive, saying that if a Bush administration  sponsored such a group, Mr. Bush  ''would make clear he didn't share their point of view.''

  The controversy over Mr. Bush's campaign stop at Bob Jones, in South Carolina, was stoked by Senator John McCain, who was Mr. Bush's main rival for the Republican presidential nomination.

  In the 11 weeks since Vice President Al Gore beat former Senator Bill Bradley in the Democratic presidential race, the two men have not spoken. But there are signs that a reconciliation may lie ahead.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides to Mr. Bradley say they expect him to appear with Mr. Gore sometime before the Democratic National Convention in August, and possibly as soon as next month. And in a news conference on Thursday night, Mr. Gore acknowledged as much.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked whether he expected to appear publicly with Mr. Bradley, Mr. Gore imitated a fortuneteller, closing his eyes, pointing a finger to his temple and saying, ''I see that in the future.'' He declined to say when the appearance would take place.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And though the two men have not spoken in weeks, Mr. Gore contended that their relationship was ''in good shape.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some have doubts that those talks can overcome the bad feelings of the primaries. Disappointed with his failure to win a single state and dismayed with Mr. Gore's brass-knuckle campaign, Mr. Bradley disappeared from public view after bowing out of the race on March 9. And Mr. Gore has made little personal effort to draw him out.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his news conference on Thursday night, Mr. Gore said Mr. Bradley would definitely be given time to speak at the convention. Asked about negotiations over delegates, the vice president replied, ''I don't think there will be a problem of any kind.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides to Mr. Bradley say talks between the two camps have been reasonably smooth. But some friends of his contend that the Gore campaign should have acted sooner to unify the party and recruit his help. They say one reason Mr. Bradley has kept a low profile is that Mr. Gore has not called him personally to request his support. ''They've obviously made a calculation that they don't need Bradley's help,'' said one Democratic member of Congress who supported the Bradley campaign.

  Mr. Specter said the Gore and Freeh situations were ''as different as night and day.'' Mr. Freeh, he said, was clearly shown to have made an innocent mistake and had corrected it quickly. The questions about Mr. Gore involve whether the vice president was telling the truth when he asserted he was unaware that his fund-raising efforts were aimed at raising money that is both limited and regulated by federal law.

  As a result, the Gore campaign and the Democratic National Committee are preparing television commercials, largely biographical, for which he has been taping scenes over the last few weeks. They will highlight his experiences outside of Washington, including his time in Tennessee as a divinity student and a journalist, and his family, including the fact that he has been married 30 years and is a new grandfather.

  Today Mr. Gore spent the day at the Cordova School, a 1,120-student magnet school here outside Memphis, his sixth such visit to schools around the country since the end of the primary season in March. His main message today, as it has been during previous school visits, was to emphasize the involvement of parents in their children's lives. The level of detail into which he becomes engrossed was evident in his response to a question about the behavior of children on school buses.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-27-2000

 <textdata>
  ''One of the school bus drivers in a school in North Carolina made a suggestion that might go to your question,'' Mr. Gore said. ''He said that when children bring home their report cards on how they are doing in their course work that they ought to get a grade in bus.''

  Asked how those who attend the ceremony might distinguish Mr. Gore the vice president from Mr. Gore the presidential candidate, Major Whaley said the vice president's right to speak ''to future leaders of our nation and our Army'' cannot be taken away from him because he is aspiring to higher office.

  The question by Republicans about Mr. Gore's appearance at the military academy seemed more of a warning than concern about the past, putting Mr. Gore and his campaign on notice that, say, using the platform of a service academy commencement, either for television commercials or political remarks, would cross a line.

  BUSH BYPASSES TEXAS CONVENTION -- Gov. George W. Bush will skip the Texas Republican Party convention in Houston next month. The decision, reported in The Houston Chronicle on Friday, has prompted speculation that the decision grew out of skirmishes with conservative elements of the party, but Bush campaign aides insisted otherwise. ''The governor will be campaigning in Florida and Kentucky at that time,'' said Ray Sullivan, a campaign spokesman in Austin. ''But Laura Bush is planning to address the convention as his representative.'' Mr. Sullivan denied that there were any lingering problems with anti-abortion elements of the party that, during the 1996 Texas convention, stripped Mr. Bush of a governor's traditional role as leader of the state delegation to the national convention.

  NEIGHBORLY ADVICE -- Crawford High School in Crawford, Texas, had never had a commencement speaker until Gov. George W. Bush volunteered, choosing the Friday night event to say hello to his new neighbors. The Texas governor last year bought a ranch -- expected to be a sort of Western White House if he is elected -- about 7 miles west of Crawford, 115 miles southwest of Dallas. In his talk, Mr. Bush gave the 45 graduates some advice, including, ''I've learned that no matter how old you are or how important your job is you can never escape your mother.''

  One came in the Carter administration, setting aside more than five million acres as wilderness, and another in the Bush administration, when Congress agreed to phase out much of a subsidy that was allowing two major timber companies to pay as little as $2 for huge Sitka spruce logs that would fetch about $300 on the open market. The subsidy dated to the 1950's, when the United States Forest Service agreed to provide a steady supply of timber at low prices to two companies that agreed to build pulp mills in the area.

  A BOSNIAN BY ANY OTHER NAME -- Although aides to Gov. George W. Bush have dismissed as unimportant the several times he has mangled the proper terms for people of various nationalities, they were elated by a report yesterday that his adversary, Vice President Al Gore, had committed a similar error. Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, gleefully broadcast the bulletin that Mr. Gore had referred to Bosnians as Bosniaks. ''It can happen to the best of us,'' Ms. Hughes said, ''as I hope the vice president will concede.'' Yes, but. As it turns out, Bosniak is an apparently acceptable alternative, listed in some dictionaries, so Mr. Gore spoke correctly. And Ms. Hughes got no more mileage out of the incident than she had with a disapproving recitation on Tuesday night of Jewish jokes that the vice president had publicly told. Where was the outrage? Not among the Bush press corps, whose members were too busy laughing to be on political-correctness patrol.

  BUSH AHEAD IN NEW POLL -- The latest national presidential preference poll shows Mr. Bush taking a substantial eight-point lead over Mr. Gore, 51 percent to 43 percent. The poll, published yesterday in The Los Angeles Times, surveyed 1,211 registered voters, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. It was conducted from May 4 to 7, just about the same time that a poll done for the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found Mr. Bush barely edging Mr. Gore, 46 percent to 45 percent. That poll, conducted May 2 to 6 and covering 940 registered voters, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Meanwhile, in polls conducted last week in six of the largest and most politically important states by the American Research Group of Manchester, N.H., Mr. Bush leads Mr. Gore by 7 percentage points in Florida, 47 points in Texas and 3 points in Pennsylvania, whereas Mr. Gore leads by 14 points in California and 20 in New York. In Illinois, there is a tie. Over all, according to the latest available state polls, Mr. Bush is ahead in 17 states (good for 183 of the required 270 electoral votes), and Mr. Gore leads in 10 states (good for 146 electoral votes).

  A MESSAGE FROM WOMEN -- Mr. Gore, who polls indicate is having difficulty maintaining the traditional Democratic advantage with women, has been put on notice by two dozen women's organizations that he needs to work harder to win women's political allegiance. In an hourlong session on Tuesday in the Old Executive Office Building with about 40 leaders of the women's groups, the vice president was told he needed a better media strategy to convey his positions on issues like Social Security, paycheck fairness, domestic violence and abortion. ''The message isn't getting out to women,'' Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National Organization for Women, said in an interview after the meeting. Nancy Zirkin, a spokeswoman for the American Association of University Women, said the meeting was requested four months ago, on a nonpartisan basis, so the women could hold a general discussion with Mr. Gore about their concerns. She said the request was not prompted by the vice president's lag in the polls or by growing polling evidence that the Democratic candidate's edge with women was beginning to erode. Mr. Gore, who was accompanied at the meeting by Donna Brazile, his campaign manager; Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, and Alexis M. Herman, the secretary of labor, agreed to additional meetings. Ms. Brazile suggested after the meeting that the women's groups could help him get out his message. ''But we're not in any trouble with women voters,'' she insisted.

  Under Mr. Bush's plan, which anticipates the fast-growing number of older Americans, people of any age who buy insurance for the kind of extended nursing-home stays not covered by other policies or by Medicare could fully deduct the annual premium from their taxes, whether they itemize deductions or not.

  ''To many of our seniors, illness can be a path to financial ruin, and this is one of the greatest fears of retirement and our nation must address it as we head into the 21st century,'' Mr. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, told about 80 people at a nursing home here.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The scope and expense of Mr. Bush's proposal was modest -- it would cost $7.4 billion over five years -- and some critics said it would make only the smallest of dents in a problem that is becoming ever more severe. But the plan represents an effort to demonstrate that Mr. Bush is paying heed to health care and to elderly people, an issue and a voting bloc that could be decisive in the presidential election this fall.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush seemed to take the dynamics of the electorate into full account with remarks that aimed for a kind of political trifecta, singling out and offering reassurances not only to the elderly but also to baby boomers and to women. His message to baby boomers was that their anticipatory qualms about retirement were foremost in his mind, while his nod to women was his recognition that they typically shoulder most of the responsibility for older relatives.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the elderly were arguably his most important audience, because Vice President Al Gore has asserted that he has more thoughtful and responsible ideas for both health care and Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was clearly trying to challenge that claim. He intends to follow today's proposals with a speech on Monday outlining his philosophy on changing Social Security and Medicare and dealing with the high cost of prescription drugs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The high stakes of the presidential candidates' jostling over these issues was suggested by the fact the Gore campaign arranged for reporters to talk on the phone today with the secretary of health and human services, Donna E. Shalala.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dr. Shalala did not seem to be fully aware about what, exactly, Mr. Bush was recommending, but she said the plausibility of all of his proposals was thrown into doubt by his call for a tax cut of $483 billion over five years, which is much larger than the tax cut Mr. Gore favors.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dr. Shalala also said that Mr. Bush's financial incentives to buy long-term care insurance did nothing to address the flaws of many of the policies on the market and that the exemption that Mr. Bush would grant home caregivers was nowhere near as generous as the $3,000 tax credit that the Clinton administration had proposed and that Mr. Gore supports. The exemption, for someone in a 15 percent tax bracket would amount to only a few hundred dollars a year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Long-term care insurance, which fills a gap in what is provided by private and corporate health care policies and Medicare, covers the cost of an extended stay in a nursing home or assisted-living center for people whose financial resources have not dwindled to the point where they qualify for Medicaid. Figures provided by the Bush campaign indicated, only about 5 percent of Americans had such policies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  An aide to Mr. Bush said that a 39-year-old person would pay an annual premium of about $358 for a policy that guaranteed two years of nursing home care, and $507 for a policy that guaranteed five years; a 64-year-old would pay about $1,265 for the two-year guarantee and $1,709 for the five-year one. The older the person buying the policy, the more it costs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  More than 40 percent of Americans over the age of 65 have annual incomes of under $20,000. Joshua M. Wiener, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute in Washington, noted that these people would be unable to afford such a policy even after Mr. Bush's deduction, which would shave only a few hundred dollars off the price.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is basically for the upper-middle-class elderly,'' Mr. Wiener said of Mr. Bush's proposal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush plan also sets no income ceiling for eligibility, so that wealthy Americans in higher tax brackets would save more on the policies than middle-class Americans, because the tax deduction would be more valuable for them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But an aide to Mr. Bush said the plan was not intended primarily for these people, many of whom have jobs that already offer long-term care benefits and thus would not qualify for the deduction.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Bush, citing figures on the looming rise in the number of Americans over 65, said it was important to put mechanisms into place to encourage their financial security and to decrease the number who will end up needing public money and help.

  Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has said he will support an extension of the moratorium.

  Social Security has emerged as a critical issue in this year's presidential campaign, but neither candidate seems prepared to address the system's long-term financial problems. Instead, Gov. George W. Bush wants to let individuals invest a small part of their Social Security contributions in the stock market, where he thinks they will earn a better return, and Vice President Al Gore proposes to keep the system largely intact with an infusion of general tax revenues. Neither proposal would really stabilize the system in the long run. In truth, though Social Security is projected to become bankrupt in four decades, the system is not all that far out of kilter. It would not be hard for bold politicians to devise a fix.

  Social Security may well be, as Governor Bush has said, ''the single most successful government program in American history.'' It was created in 1935, during the depths of the depression, to provide a guaranteed income to retired workers for as long as they live. Unlike private pension plans, Social Security benefits keep pace with inflation and, unlike 401(k)'s and other popular private plans, Social Security benefits do not fluctuate with stock and bond markets. Social Security provides the majority of income for most retirees and all the income for about a fifth of the elderly.

  One proposed remedy for financial imbalance is partial privatization, the approach favored  by Governor Bush. Under current law, workers  and employers pay a 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes into a public trust fund. Under partial privatization, workers could divert, say, two percentage points of that tax to private accounts that the worker could then invest in stocks and bonds. Workers would collect less money from the trust fund when they retired, alleviating financial strain on  the system. But they would expect to more than make up for the loss by drawing from their private accounts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's sketchy proposal fails to answer where he would find the money to pay retirees as payroll taxes were diverted into private accounts. But there are other fundamental problems with the proposal as well.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush cites as an advantage that private accounts can be invested in stocks whereas the trust fund by law cannot. But if the law were changed to let the trust fund itself purchase stocks, as President Clinton has proposed, it could invest in the markets far more cheaply than could private accounts. The cost of administering 150 million individual private accounts would be huge, eating away 20 percent or more of worker deposits. Private accounts could also subject individuals, including the poor, to unacceptable investment risk at the most vulnerable time in their lives. Worse, they undermine the principle of social insurance, setting individuals off to fend for themselves without looking out for the needy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Vice President Al Gore proposes to leave the basic system unchanged and would use general revenues to extend the life of the trust fund to about 2050. He ducks proposing tax hikes or benefit cuts that would be needed to solve the system's problems after that date. Indeed, he does the opposite by proposing new benefits for stay-at-home mothers and for widows and widowers, thereby increasing the financial strain on the system.

  These two ideas, remembrance and reconciliation, will surely survive in the century ahead. But there may be subtle changes in the spirit if not the essential purposes of the holiday, just as there have been changes in the demography of the marchers. It has been many years since old men in threadbare gray and blue uniforms paraded down the nation's main streets. It has been 20 years at least since we saw more than a few veterans of World War I. Now the cohort that fought World War II is diminishing. George Bush, senior, is almost certainly that celebrated generation's last president.

  These two ideas, remembrance and reconciliation, will surely survive in the century ahead.

  Our cultural memory is also receding, especially the recollection of what it was like to have an entire country mobilized, body and soul, to fight an enemy. The First and Second World Wars were, to most Americans, unambiguously noble, and so in its goals of eliminating slavery and saving the union was the Civil War. But since then our conflicts have become less clear-cut -- most famously Vietnam, but also to some extent Korea and even Mr. Bush's Desert Storm.

  Mr. Cohen extended the invitation after Mr. Bush proposed last week to consider making unilateral reductions in nuclear weapons, possibly deeper than those now being negotiated between the United States and Russia. Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also pledged to construct a far larger antiballistic missile defense than the one now contemplated by the Clinton administration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cohen, appearing today on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' said Mr. Bush's proposals contained ''internal inconsistencies.'' Building a larger missile defense than the administration's limited one, Mr. Cohen added, would force the Russians and other nations, like China, to increase their own offensive nuclear arsenals, making negotiated reductions far less likely.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cohen's objections echoed those Mr. Gore made during his commencement address at the United States Military Academy on Saturday, when he said Mr. Bush's proposals were harmful to arms control and threatening to global stability.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said he would invite Mr. Bush to meet with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Adm. Richard W. Mies, commander of the American nuclear arsenal, as a matter of fairness in the presidential campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  ''I think that he and then Vice President Gore will be in a better position to debate this in a way that's responsible and, I think, informed,'' he said.

  Mindy Tucker, the Bush campaign's press secretary, said in response to Mr. Cohen's proposal, referring to two key Bush advisers:
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Surely Secretary Cohen is not suggesting that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and General Colin Powell, who led our defenses, don't understand them. And we are confident that the Joint Chiefs of Staff would welcome Governor Bush's proposal because it allows military planners to determine the appropriate levels of security based on new guidance and a new security era.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We would hope that Al Gore would call on his administration not to play politics with these briefings or the Joint Chiefs of Staff,'' Ms. Tucker said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Pentagon officials said the invitation to Mr. Bush was Mr. Cohen's idea. While it is common for a president-elect to receive high-level national security briefings as part of the transition to the White House, it is unusual to extend such an early invitation to a presidential candidate from the party out of power, especially one who has not yet received his party's formal nomination.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In light of Mr. Cohen's criticism, the invitation could be seen as a suggestion that Mr. Bush's ideas are ill-formed. At the same time, having Mr. Bush discuss nuclear strategy with senior commanders could lend weight to the governor's handling of military issues in the campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Pentagon officials said they had not yet made arrangements for a briefing. One potentially knotty problem could be the degree of secrecy concerning nuclear weapons. Since Mr. Bush does not have a security clearance, his briefing might be limited to unclassified information.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his proposal last week, Mr. Bush did not say he would reduce the number of nuclear weapons automatically. Instead, he said he would consider reductions based on recommendations by the Pentagon's military commanders. Last Tuesday, even as Mr. Bush made his proposals, those commanders appeared on Capitol Hill and said they would oppose reducing the number of warheads below the 2,000 to 2,500 being negotiated under the third strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start 3.

  Taking one of the biggest political risks of the presidential campaign so far, Mr. Bush proposed allowing individual workers to invest a part of their payroll taxes through private accounts. His plan would give workers an opportunity to capture some of the riches that Wall Street creates, but would also leave those workers to suffer the financial consequences if their timing or judgment is off.

  Mr. Gore wants to maintain the guaranteed nature of the Social Security benefit, allowing it to remain a bulwark against poverty in old age. But through a somewhat complicated mechanism, Mr. Gore is calling for the bill to be paid in part over the long run out of general tax revenues -- in effect, heaving the problem onto the shoulders of taxpayers three decades from now.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Like most Democrats, Mr. Gore is comfortable with government as a guarantor and sees Social Security as a collective commitment that binds the generations. Like most Republicans, Mr. Bush is dedicated to giving more power and responsibility to individuals.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In elevating the call for private accounts to the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush is asking for a mandate to break the deadlock. Although Mr. Gore's approach would eventually require a fundamental change in  the nature of the system as well, the vice president has cast himself as the defender of a program that has proved to be perhaps the most popular and most effective of any administered in Washington.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is already clear that the clash between the two candidates will be supercharged, with Mr. Gore in particular unleashing a sustained attack on Mr. Bush's position. And the more heated the clash, the greater the risk that the debate will so polarize voters and unnerve politicians that it blocks progress for years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many Democrats and some Republicans wonder why Mr. Bush has chosen to wade into such a polarizing issue. ''Politically it's not'' a great idea, said Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire who is one of the most prominent advocates of adding private accounts to Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The Bush campaign is betting that young people will end up voting on this issue,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ''But recent history is pretty clear that the people who vote on Social Security tend to be in their 50's and older, and their vote is based on making sure that the system that's protecting their parents is there to protect them.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Bush is trying to turn attention to the trade-off at the core of Mr. Gore's plan, which is built around eliminating the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public and capturing the interest savings for Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The Gore plan will eventually require a 25 percent increase in income taxes -- the largest in our history -- or a substantial reduction in benefits,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore is trying to keep the debate focused on the risks inherent  in investing Social Security money in the financial markets -- and is emphasizing that Mr. Bush's plan would leave less money to pay down the debt. The Bush plan ''would weaken our national economy,'' Mr. Gore said, and create the risk of millions of retirees ''left without enough to make ends meet.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said one thing today that Mr. Bush would no doubt agree with.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There is a fundamental difference on this issue in this election,'' Mr. Gore said, ''which offers the country the most critical choice on Social Security since it was first enacted in 1935.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Social Security faces a financial shortfall as the baby boom generation ages. Based on current estimates, the retirement system would spend its reserves by 2037, leaving it able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits after that point. To deal with that problem, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are proposing different solutions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Starting in 2011, Mr. Gore would begin transferring to Social Security an amount equal to the interest saved through reduction of the public debt. The amount would start at around $100 billion a year, and would grow to more than $200 billion a year by 2015. By doing so, Mr. Gore's plan would extend Social Security's solvency to 2050 without any cuts in benefits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The money Mr. Gore would transfer into Social Security would not be cash, but instead i.o.u.'s that would have to be paid out of general tax revenues. In that way, Mr. Gore's plan would obligate taxpayers decades in the future to pay to keep the system afloat out of general revenues from income taxes -- a change from the current system under which Social Security is financed out of payroll taxes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's approach is built around the idea that the only alternative to cutting benefits or raising taxes is to increase the rate of return on the money going into the Social Security system. The best way to accomplish that goal, in his view, is to allow all workers to invest part of their payroll taxes in private accounts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has provided few details, saying that the specifics would have to be worked out in bipartisan negotiations. There are a variety of approaches to establishing individual investment accounts, and most would use about 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes to pay Social Security benefits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Any investment plan that used 2 percentage points of the payroll tax would use about $1 trillion of the Social Security surplus over the next decade. That money would otherwise go to debt reduction, so Mr. Bush's plan would leave the nation with a larger debt than Mr. Gore's plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Historically, investing in the stock market has yielded a high rate of return, better than 7 percent from 1926 through 1997, according to the Bush campaign. But there have been long periods when the market has been down, and not every investor has chosen the right stocks. Investing in safer alternatives, like bonds, reduces the rate of return along with the risk. And Democrats point out that most workers are already subject to considerable risk through 401(k)'s and other retirement accounts.

  Although Social Security has long been considered the ''third rail'' of politics that a candidate touches at his peril, Mr. Bush took a gamble that in the new economy, with nearly 50 percent of American households now owning stock, his proposal would prove appealing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and me,'' Mr. Bush said in an appearance at a center for the elderly here. ''He trusts the government to manage our retirement. I trust individual Americans.'' [Excerpts, Page A18.]
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000

  Mr. Bush also embraced a bipartisan proposal for Medicare that would reshape it by giving beneficiaries fixed amounts of money to choose from various health plans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A few hours later outside Philadelphia, Mr. Gore came out squarely against the plan, calling it dangerous for individual taxpayers and for the economy overall. ''If we turn the Social Security system into a system of winners and losers,'' he said, ''we will be jeopardizing retirement security for too many Americans, and in the end we will all have to pay to make up the differences.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Shifting some of the payroll tax into individual retirement accounts would amount to the most far-reaching change in Social Security since its inception in the Depression. As Social Security has worked for decades, current retirees are paid from the payroll taxes of current workers; under the Bush plan, workers would be able to use a portion of their payroll taxes and invest them for their own retirement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush argued that it would both provide an infusion of cash to make the system solvent and give people ''the security of ownership.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But he largely skirted specifics, preferring to talk about broad principles. It was unclear, for instance, exactly how much money people could set aside for individual accounts and what sort of investment options they would have. Mr. Bush did say the investments would have to be in ''steady, reliable funds,'' adding that ''there will be no fly-by-night speculators or day trading.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I am here with a message for America and to put my opponent on notice,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The days of spreading fear and panic are over. The days of delaying, dividing, demagoguing are over. When I am elected, this generation and this president will solve Social Security.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said that President Clinton and Mr. Gore had squandered eight years when they could have addressed the problems posed by the baby boomers. ''At a time for leadership, for long-term thinking, my opponent proposes a Band-Aid approach,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He says and I quote, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' But in the lifetime of some people in this room, it will be broke and we must fix it. With every day of delay this becomes more difficult.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has in large part staked his candidacy on the health of the economy and made paying down the debt the centerpiece of his economic plan. He has proposed extending the life of Social Security until 2054 by devoting the interest saved in paying down the debt to the retirement system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore, in his own appearance, asked what would happen to investments if economic prosperity abated. ''Today, when Wall Street is booming, I know that plan sounds appealing,'' he said. ''It probably sounds like an easy way to make more money and have more control over your retirement. But in reality, the Bush privatization plan would weaken our economy and undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum basic retirement.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked later about his lack of detail, Mr. Bush called his speech ''pretty darned detailed to be talking about a framework to get something done.'' His aides said he had avoided specifics because Hillary Rodham Clinton's abortive effort to craft a plan for universal health coverage had shown that being locked into one plan was a recipe for legislative disaster on a complicated issue.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the lack of specifics on matters like what percentage of payroll tax would go to accounts and what age group would see the change opened Mr. Bush to charges that he was masking some of the hard choices ahead and trying to sidestep questions about how he could afford the transition as well as his sweeping call for a $1.3 trillion tax cut in the next decade.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Supporters of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore feuded all day over which plan was more risky and which would entail more of a shift of general tax revenue into Social Security. Such a shift would require cuts in other programs or could lead to tax increases.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president asserted that Mr. Bush's plan would make it nearly impossible to pay down the national debt. ''By leaving us with a multitrillion dollar debt for as far as the eye can see, the Bush plan could trigger higher interest rates and slower long-term growth,'' Mr. Gore said. ''That undermines our chance to meet other challenges, such as keeping Medicare solvent or providing an affordable prescription drug benefit for seniors.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has been lagging in recent polls and his advisers said privately they were pleased that Mr. Bush had taken on Social Security because it set up a clear policy difference between the candidates and provided a big target to shoot at, much like former Senator Bill Bradley's universal health care plan in the Democratic primaries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, Mr. Gore intends to talk about Social Security two more times this week, before younger voters at Fordham University in New York on Tuesday and before older voters in Florida on Wednesday.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's advisers, however, believe that the politics of Social Security is changing and that their plan will appeal to younger voters who are comfortable with the market and doubt that the government will provide a secure retirement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today, Mr. Bush also expressed support for an approach to Medicare that had been drafted by a bipartisan commission, which would have converted Medicare into an arena for public and private competition. The approach would have given each beneficiary a fixed amount of cash to use when choosing from public and private health care plans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said the elderly should be given a choice of health plans to buy, including one providing prescription drug coverage. He said Medicare itself should provide full drug coverage for the most low-income elderly.

  At a time for leadership, for long-term thinking, my opponent proposes a Band-Aid approach. He says, ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' But in the lifetime of some people in this room, it will be broke, and we must fix it. With every day of delay this becomes more difficult. For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has failed to act. And now Al Gore wants to pass the burden on to future generations. The Gore plan will eventually require either a 25 percent increase in income taxes, the largest in our history, or a substantial reduction in benefits. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000

 <textdata>
  George W. Bush outlined his approach in a speech this morning. We still don't know all the details of his plan, but we do know that he is proposing to partially privatize Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in reality, the Bush Social Security privatization plan would weaken our national economy and undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum decent retirement. It would weaken our economy because it would make it impossible to pay down our national debt. It would cost about $1 trillion over 10 years to meet today's obligations through Social Security while allowing people to set up these individual accounts. And at the same time, Governor Bush is proposing a huge tax cut of nearly $2 trillion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The numbers just don't add up, and under the Bush plan, a serious reduction of our national debt is simply impossible. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush Social Security privatization plan also threatens the Social Security guarantee for future generations of retirees. That guarantee is the whole purpose of Social Security. Yet under the Bush plan, you could lose some or all of the money you invest, and millions could be left without enough to make ends meet.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today, in The Dallas Morning News, Governor Bush was asked whether his plan would guarantee that future beneficiaries would receive no less than they would have under today's system. His answer, ''Maybe, maybe not.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In other words, Governor Bush admits that his plan takes the ''security'' out of Social Security. Well, I believe you deserve a guarantee, not a ''maybe.''

  Despite Mr. Bush's advantages six months before Election Day, Mr. Gore may be heartened that vice presidents are often overshadowed by the presidents they serve until they can distinguish themselves on a national stage at their nominating convention. In fact, at this time 12 years ago, Mr. Bush's father, then the vice president, trailed Michael S. Dukakis by 10 points, but went on to a lopsided victory in November.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Voters also seemed skeptical of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut of $483 billion over five years -- a measure that Mr. Gore has condemned as a ''risky tax scheme.'' Even 57 percent of people who said they planned to vote for Mr. Bush were uncertain of the effect of that proposal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush will also have to cautiously navigate roiling factions in his own ranks. Three of every 10 Republican voters polled said that if the governor picks a running mate who supports legalized abortion they would be less likely to support him. About a third of all voters said religious conservatives carry too much influence in the Republican Party.

  Perhaps the most promising news for Mr. Gore was that he scored well with voters on issues they said were at the top of their agenda, like health care, education and Social Security. He was also seen as more caring than Mr. Bush, despite the governor's slogan that he is a ''compassionate conservative.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Given that his issues are popular and that the economy seems hearty, the nagging difficulty that has confounded the vice president's advisers and many Democrats is why his overall ratings are not more competitive with Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Among all voters, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by 8 percentage points, 47 to 39. Mr. Bush held a wide advantage among men, 50 to 36 percentage points; among women, Mr. Gore drew 42 percent, Mr. Bush, 44 percent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president's lagging ratings appear to have more to do with personality than policy. Mr. Gore was seen favorably by 34 percent of registered voters and unfavorably by 36 percent. By contrast, Mr. Bush was seen favorably by 40 percent and unfavorably by 28 percent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A related problem that has dogged Mr. Gore is that Mr. Bush is viewed as more of a leader. Fifty-three percent of registered voters in the new poll said Mr. Gore had strong leadership qualities; 63 percent said the same thing about Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The contrast is striking, particularly since Mr. Gore has been an elected official since 1976, when he was elected to the House from Tennessee; Mr. Bush was elected governor, his first office, in 1994. That said, Mr. Gore has spent the past seven years in the shadow of a president who consistently draws high ratings for the job he has done in office.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''Gore has not really shown a lot of leadership qualities or abilities to be in a position to run our nation,'' said Ken Bogler, 27, a labor representative from Somerset, N.J., who is an independent. ''It's a presence, really. The way he carries himself, the way he speaks, does not seem presidential.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Vera Jeane, 71, a retired nurse from Bay City, Tex., who is a Democrat, put it this way: ''Al Gore acts as if he's not sure what he's thinking, as if he doesn't have a mind of his own. He doesn't seem to be strong enough in his opinions and as a leader to be president. Bush seems to be a stronger man with more definitive opinions. And I think he would make a better leader.''
 </textdata>

  Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said he was not discouraged by such critiques and insisted that voters would defect from Mr. Bush when his policy stands are articulated in detail.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Citing how Mr. Gore has inched up in the polls since last year, Mr. Coelho added: ''We've made up a lot of points with George Bush. I'm not worried about George Bush at this point.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, in particular, has made little headway in trumpeting his programs for cutting taxes and overhauling the Social Security system. Only 9 percent of registered voters in the poll said they knew a great deal about Mr. Bush's tax blueprint; 58 percent said they had no idea whether his plan would help or hurt the economy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000

  In a finding that raises questions about the Social Security proposal Mr. Bush discussed yesterday, those polled were closely divided over whether individuals should be allowed to invest portions of their Social Security taxes on their own.

  When asked to put aside their presidential preferences and focus on issues, Mr. Gore was considered more capable in tackling Social Security and education, traditional Democratic strengths.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Voters also identified stark ideological differences between the candidates. For all the efforts by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to court moderates, voters did not see them as moderates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Forty-three percent of registered voters said they thought of Mr. Bush as a conservative while 34 percent said they thought he was a moderate. Similarly, 43 percent cast Mr. Gore as a liberal, while 30 percent said he was more a moderate.

  Mr. Bush has been unable to shake the idea advanced by gun control advocates that the National Rifle Association would wield considerable influence in a Bush administration. Voters were three times more likely to say that Mr. Bush would be influenced greatly by the N.R.A. than Mr. Gore would.

  In the follow-up interviews, some voters, citing character considerations, lamented that Senator John McCain, who was defeated by Mr. Bush in the Republican primaries, would not be on any ticket. In fact, Mr. McCain has maintained far more impressive favorability ratings than Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore: 46 percent have a favorable view of him; 14 percent hold an unfavorable view.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-16-2000

  ''I don't see in Gore or Bush that clear definitive leadership quality that McCain had,'' said Tim Olkar, 22, a student in Wheaton, Ill., who is an independent.

  AL GORE, THE CARTOON -- Vice President Al Gore's aides may have finally found a way to overcome complaints about his being too stiff: animation. In the May 21 season finale of the Fox sci-fi comedy, ''Futurama,'' the real Mr. Gore provides the voice for a cartoon Al Gore in an episode titled, ''Back to the Present.'' In the show, the cartoon Mr. Gore leads a team of ''Action Rangers'' who help the bumbling Futurama regular, Fry, return to the 31st Century after he gets stranded in the 21st.

  AL GORE, THE FATHER AND SON -- After wrapping up a campaign speech yesterday afternoon near Philadelphia, Vice President Al Gore flew on a half-empty Air Force II to Nashville, to pick up his mother, Pauline. The two were scheduled to fly to New York City today to see Mr. Gore's daughter, Karenna, graduate from Columbia Law School. Mr. Gore's aides said the flight to Nashville was paid for by taxpayers instead of by his campaign because it involved family business.

  *Except for Jimmy Carter, every president for the last quarter-century has been left-handed. There is no question about Gerald R. Ford, George Bush or Bill Clinton. Ronald Reagan writes and eats with his right hand. But Edmund Morris, the Reagan biographer, has little doubt that Mr. Reagan is a natural lefty who is one of those who were trained to use their right hands. In the movies, Mr. Morris says, Mr. Reagan always twirled and shot pistols with his left hand, and as president, he always waved with his left hand. The presidential string is about to be broken. Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are both right-handed.

  Still, he's getting the brush. In the latest New York Times poll, George W. Bush has a wide lead with men and, amazingly, edges out Mr. Gore with women (who elected Bill Clinton), 44 to 42 percent. Even feminists are nagging Mr. Gore about his lack of oomph.

  ''Nuclear unilateralism will hinder, rather than help, arms control,'' Mr. Gore said, before handing out diplomas to the 944 graduates who trooped across the stage in their dress uniforms and white gloves.

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Without mentioning Mr. Bush by name, Mr. Gore issued the most detailed rebuttal yet of the foreign policy address that Mr. Bush delivered in Washington on Tuesday. Again and again, Mr. Gore assailed the notion of one-sided arms reductions, a prospect that Mr. Bush had raised at an appearance with a cast of well-known Republican foreign policy leaders.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore emphasized that reductions should be pursued within negotiations and the framework of existing arms control treaties.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president said that the Clinton administration was already negotiating for bilateral cuts in nuclear arms and was considering a limited missile defense, but said the kind of approach recommended by Mr. Bush was misguided.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Reductions alone do not guarantee stability,'' Mr. Gore said. ''It is how reductions are made and how they interact with defensive systems that makes the difference.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's remarks were unmistakably pointed in criticism of the Bush speech, which called for a reduction -- possibly unilateral -- in American nuclear weapons combined with an expanded missile defense system.

  Mr. Gore was invited to the academy in his capacity as vice president, and the speech was billed as an official vice presidential event, not a campaign appearance. As such, he told reporters on Friday night, his remarks on the academy grounds would not be ''political'' in nature. ''I will not make a partisan remark,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But his comments today were Mr. Gore's first in public since Mr. Bush made his proposal on Tuesday, and they were being written by the vice president and his longtime national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, as the vice presidential entourage flew to the Hudson Valley on Friday night aboard Air Force Two from a campaign appearance in Memphis.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Fuerth told reporters that the vice president's comments were based on his long-standing principles and the fact that President Clinton was going to Russia next week, and that they were not intended as a response to Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In Mr. Gore's discussion with reporters on Friday night on Air Force Two, he sharply criticized Mr. Bush's proposal. He said it would re-ignite the arms race, and by saying so, he seemed to ensure that his differences with Mr. Bush would be part of the news media's coverage today.
 </textdata>

  Today, at the graduation exercise, Mr. Gore outlined the Clinton administration's efforts toward creating a national missile defense system that would protect all 50 states from a limited attack.

 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We believe, however, that it is essential to do this in a way that does not destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The A.B.M. Treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability in our relationship with Russia.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What Mr. Bush proposed would almost surely entail violating the A.B.M. Treaty of 1972.

  Mr. Bush said he wanted to reduce the size of the United States' nuclear arsenal to the ''lowest possible number consistent with our national security'' and below the levels called for under the Start II accord with Russia.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also noted in his speech to the cadets that President Clinton was headed for Moscow next week. ''This is an historic meeting,'' he said. ''The president should leave with the full support of the American people,'' a subtle reminder to Republicans that partisan differences over national security traditionally stop at the water's edge when the president travels abroad.

  Mr. Bush's speech on military preparedness, delivered in Washington as he was flanked by foreign policy experts from four Republican administrations, earned the governor widespread news media coverage on a topic on which the Gore campaign has hoped Mr. Bush would appear inexperienced and politically vulnerable.

  The Vietnam-fighting experience of the husky, 55-year-old Pennsylvania governor comes in handy these days. He is being targeted by the social conservative right for being a Roman Catholic who unapologetically favors a woman's right to choose abortion, yet remains prominently featured on a list of potential running mates of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the putative Republican presidential nominee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But social and religious conservatives see things differently, and have issued stern warnings to Mr. Bush of dire consequences in November if he picks someone like Mr. Ridge.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Ridge, his abortion rights stand firmly defying party platform dogma, remains the most mentioned prospective running mate. He set a Republican record for this heavily Democratic state with a 780,000-vote victory margin in his 1998 re-election. A Bush-Ridge ticket might well deliver this critical battleground, the fifth-largest state in electoral votes, to the Republicans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In two elections, Mr. Ridge has shown considerable crossover attraction among Democratic voters. He has the power to garner up to 30 percent of them, according to polls -- a factor that Mr. Bush must weigh as he charts a centrist strategy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Other Republicans also note that Mr. Bush had to be more sensitive to the nation's large Catholic vote after his controversial speech in the South Carolina primary at Bob Jones University, a campus that critics denounce as anti-Catholic.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''All this wonderful speculation,'' remarked Governor Ridge, his smile broad but fatalistic as he noted that the decision on a running mate was entirely Mr. Bush's to make after a long process involving ''a lot of other people,'' in the Texas governor's words.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Only the November election, he said, with all the variables brought to the voters by the candidates and their campaigns, might settle the question of whether the Republican Party is ready for an abortion rights candidate on the ticket beside the anti-abortion Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''But I don't think we're done with the very important struggle we're having within the party as to how to deal with it,'' he continued. ''Certainly, my friend Governor Bush disagrees with me, and a majority of the delegates at the convention probably disagree with me.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Tom Ridge is a perfect fit for George Bush,'' said State Senator Christine M. Tartaglione, speaking in her role as the state Democratic chairwoman.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The governor's supporters quickly cite a raft of new social welfare and education laws to argue that he is the very model of the ''compassionate conservative'' that Mr. Bush has proclaimed as the cornerstone of his campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's a heck of a ride,'' the governor added. ''I've already got a great job, and I'm going to help my old friend George Bush get elected president. And you know? I think he can carry Pennsylvania without me.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  But John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, is pushing the labor federation's 68 member unions to line up behind Mr. Gore and House Democrats in general to increase their prospects in November.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Nonetheless, Mr. Sweeney acknowledged that many of the labor federation's 13 million members may be so upset about the China bill that they will sit out the November elections, a development that could hurt Mr. Gore worst in the industrial swing states of the Midwest.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In contrast, Mr. Sweeney is pushing unions to back Mr. Gore and most Democratic House candidates because in his view they are more likely to back labor on issues like Social Security and the minimum wage than are the Republicans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  David J. Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, predicted that the China battle would not hurt his party this fall. ''Obviously members of labor disagree with the vice president and some members of Congress on this,'' he said. ''But over all, these union members understand that working families are better served by making sure that Al Gore is the next president.''

  The Chinese also fear that the United States could adjust and expand a limited defense, which in its first phase will consist of a battle-management radar site in Alaska and 100 interceptors. And George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, has said the United States would develop a far more ambitious defensive system if he is elected president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  During the Bush administration, the Pentagon instructed the TRW Corporation, an American military contractor, to develop ground-based interceptors that would stop ''limited attacks by China'' using CSS-4 missiles, according to a 1993 document prepared by the United States Army.

  The good news about education has become obvious: the quality of public schools is now on center stage in national politics. From George Bush and Al Gore down to aspirants for state and local office, all politicians have embraced the cause of high standards and excellence. The bad news is that the remedy everyone but teachers and pupils wants to prescribe is more testing.

  And yet many of those offering plans to reform Social Security -- among them, of course, advisers to George W. Bush -- insist that stocks are the answer, and that it is safe to assume that stocks will keep on yielding 7 percent forever. And if you try to point out that buying a piece of corporate America is much more expensive than it used to be, they just repeat the mantra that stocks have historically been a great investment. In other words, that $100 bill was there yesterday, so it must still be there, right?

  Is the odd susceptibility of first-rate economists to such a naive fallacy a triumph of wishful thinking over analysis, or a disingenuous bow to political expediency? Recent remarks by Mr. Bush offer evidence of good old-fashioned American disingenuity at work.

  In a May 15 speech he asked his listeners to ''consider this simple fact: even if a worker chose only the safest investment in the world, an inflation-adjusted U.S. government bond, he or she would receive twice the rate of return of Social Security.'' That's an amazing fact; it's even more amazing when you realize that the Social Security system invests all its money in, you guessed it, U.S. government bonds. But the explanation -- which Mr. Bush's advisers understand very well, even if the governor does not -- is that today's workers are not only paying for their own retirement, but also supporting today's retirees. And if you think that's a minor detail -- that the question of how to meet existing obligations when workers are allowed to invest their contributions elsewhere is a side issue -- let me assure you that I too would have no trouble devising a painless plan to save Social Security, if you let me assume that a large part of the system's obligations would magically disappear.

  ''People have decided that traditional arms control is broken,'' said Stephen Hadley, a Pentagon official in the Bush administration and a campaign adviser to Gov. George W. Bush. ''We've been keeping a large inventory of nuclear weapons that we don't need and that the military doesn't want.''

  ''There's no longer this cataclysmic threat of a major war every day, so we have to put nuclear weapons into the background of international affairs,'' said Mr. Perkovich. To this end, the nuclear powers should drastically cut their arsenals and take arms off high alert, as Mr. Bush proposed last week. That would help curb atomic envy in India, Pakistan and Japan, said Mr. Perkovich, author of ''India's Nuclear Bomb'' (University of California, 1999).

  Last Wednesday, at the MCI Sports Center in Washington, the Democratic Party raised an astonishing $26.5 million at a dinner headlined by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and attended by about 12,000 loyal Democrats, some paying a half-million dollars for the privilege. This staggering sum surpassed what until then had been the  record, the $21.3 million raised less than a month before by the Republicans and George W. Bush.

  At one time or another, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have decried soft money. Even so, the soft money race proceeds at a torrid clip, without shame or remorse in either political party. As of last week, the two parties had raised at least $200 million in soft money, a record for this point in the election cycle, and they are well on their way to doubling the $260 million in soft money raised in 1996. Meanwhile, individual contributions are reaching nosebleed altitudes when some dinner guests fork over $500,000.

  The polls say that the public wants reform, and in recent months dozens of corporations have decided to boycott what they see as little more than a shakedown operation. But for the most part the political leadership seems tone deaf. Mr. Bush would preserve the soft money loophole. At the Democratic gala, Mr. Gore said that the next dinner four years from now would not cost nearly as much because as president he would bring ''meaningful'' change. But neither he nor Mr. Clinton seemed the least bit embarrassed about dipping into the trough one more time.

  Though Vice President Al Gore has been an enthusiastic advocate of wider roadless areas, his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has not.

  Taking the offensive against Gov. George W.

  The result, he warned graduate students at Fordham Business School in Manhattan, would be a costly taxpayer-financed bailout of failed investors that would dwarf the multibillion-dollar rescue of bankrupt savings and loans in the 1980's. And yesterday, Mr. Bush suggested he might support allowing workers to invest a large portion of their payroll taxes, which Mr. Gore said would increase the chances of financial disaster.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Tens of millions of investors who have not gone through the Fordham Business School, who have not had an opportunity to gain some basic knowledge to protect themselves against fraud,'' Mr. Gore said, ''would be placed in a situation where a lot of financial shenanigans could take place, where they are losing their investments because they are not equipped in the way that sophisticated investors are. It happens all the time.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush accused the vice president of flip-flopping on the issue, releasing a videotape from January 1999 showing Mr. Gore arguing that it might make sense for the federal government to invest some revenue in the stock market to take advantage of its historically strong returns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked on the tape whether long-term stock investments would be safe, Mr. Gore replies: ''Over any 10-year period in American history returns on equities are just significantly higher than these other returns. And in order to capture some part of that economic advantage, surely there is a way to solve these problems.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush asserted that Mr. Gore had switched positions for political purposes. ''I believe it's important to be consistent,'' he said in a news conference in Portland, Ore. ''I believe it's important to have somebody willing to take a stand.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The day's swirling debate underscored Mr. Gore's desire to block Mr. Bush from seizing the advantage -- particularly among young voters -- on an issue that historically has played to the strengths of Democratic candidates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush's proposal could change that dynamic by making Social Security more relevant to younger voters who have grown skeptical about the system's viability but are also comfortable with the idea of investing in Wall Street. Polls show those younger voters supported President Clinton in 1996.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I think Bush is slicing into part of the Democratic coalition with this,'' said Andrew Smith, director of polling for the University of New Hampshire. ''But if older voters can be convinced that this plan is a threat to their Social Security, Bush will have problems.''

  In making Social Security a major campaign issue, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have offered sharply different proposals for extending the life of the system, which is projected to become insolvent by the year 2037.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush argues that allowing workers to invest a small portion of their payroll taxes would enable them to take advantage of the wealth created by Wall Street and reduce the cost to taxpayers of financing the system. But his plan would also leave those investors vulnerable to losses from market fluctuations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore would not change the current system that guarantees a minimum benefit. To prolong the system's life, Mr. Gore proposes using the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt and then devoting the interest saved to the retirement system. The proposal would keep the system solvent until 2054, he contends.

  Mr. Bush's event yesterday, like Mr. Gore's, was designed to take the issue beyond the elderly, as he tailored his message to the blue-collar work force at a Portland company that makes railroad freight cars and marine barges.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's advisers contend that such working-class voters are more fiscally conservative, less comfortable with the idea of investing in Wall Street and likely to be opposed to Mr. Bush's plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush tried to show that was not the case yesterday. Leading a discussion with workers who spoke highly of their 401(k) plan, the governor suggested that opponents of his plan do not trust working Americans to manage their own money.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You know I wonder out loud whether there may be some in Washington saying these workers are not smart enough to figure it out,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I wonder whether or not that's what people may be really saying deep down. You can't trust individuals in America who maybe don't have Ph.D.'s in economics.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But even as he sought to sell his proposal, Mr. Bush -- who has not provided details for many aspects of the plan -- made several remarks that are likely to provide fodder for additional attacks from Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  First, Mr. Bush left open the possibility that his call for limited accounts was just the first step in a broader transformation of the federal retirement system. Answering a question about his plan, Mr. Bush said that the government could not go ''from one regime to another overnight.'' He said: ''It's going to take a while to transition to a system where personal savings accounts are the predominant part of the investment vehicle. And so, this is a step toward a completely different world and an important step.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has refused to say what proportion of the 12.4 percent payroll tax people could put into private accounts under his plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also refused to say how much benefits might be reduced for workers who created private investment accounts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''That's all up for discussion,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  With many finance majors present at his Fordham event, Mr. Gore noted that he supported individuals investing in the stock market for retirement, provided no Social Security funds are involved. But to bolster his point that the markets can be risky, he brought along several experts, including Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street executive who was Treasury secretary until last year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, many students' questions indicated a general support for the idea of private investment accounts. But several students said after the event that Mr. Gore had raised deep questions in their minds about the Bush plan.

  The issue came up after Gov. George W. Bush asserted that Mr. Gore had a ''substantial amount of his money invested in the stock market.'' Mr. Bush made the statement Monday in promoting his plan to allow people to invest some of their Social Security payroll taxes in the market. Mr. Bush may have thought it was a safe assumption, given that half of all American households are invested in the market.

  Until today, momentum seemed to be building among most Senate Republicans for the measure, which would cut off funds for the 5,900 United States forces in Kosovo by July 1, 2001, forcing their withdrawal, unless Congress authorizes an extension. Many Republicans said they assumed that Mr. Bush endorsed the measure, which may be voted on as early as Wednesday.
 </textdata>

  ''The Clinton-Gore administration has failed to instill trust in Congress and the American people when it comes to our military and deployment of troops overseas, but the governor does not believe this provision is the way to resolve the lack of presidential leadership,'' Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said.

  This question has suddenly become much more relevant, now that George W. Bush has announced his Social Security plan. He doesn't want the trust fund itself to buy stocks. But he does want to let workers put some of their contributions into individual retirement accounts, which could be invested in stocks. And he justifies this proposal by pointing to the high returns that stock market investors have historically earned, and comparing these returns with the ''dismal'' returns of the Social Security Administration. The higher returns people can get by investing in stocks will, he argues, let him scale back guaranteed benefits without reducing actual retirement income.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Economists who make this argument point to the same statistics cited by Mr. Bush: the fact that stocks have consistently yielded a much higher rate of return than bonds. Why this ''equity premium'' persisted so long remains a puzzle: why didn't investors long ago rush into stocks, driving their prices up and their rate of return down? But anyway, the puzzle is now history: in the 1990's investors did rush into stocks. What the optimists believe is that this rush corrected an error rather than creating one, that the rise of the stock market in recent years reflects not the rise of irrational exuberance but the decline of irrational risk aversion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  I have my doubts about this story. But suppose that it is right, and that current stock valuations are in fact reasonable. Does this then validate Mr. Bush's plan? Alas, no. You see, those high returns cited by Mr. Bush -- the returns that are supposed to produce huge gains for workers free to make their own investment decisions -- are what stock investors got during an era in which people were very leery of stocks, and hence prices were low compared with earnings. Now that people are no longer so nervous, prices are much higher compared with earnings -- and the higher the price you pay for an asset, the lower the rate of return on your investment. (Duh.) So the rate of return on stock investments made now will probably be much lower than the returns people got in the past. (Remember, this is the optimistic scenario, which claims that current values are reasonable -- if they aren't, the return will be even lower.) And that means that the proposition that individual investors can expect to do a lot better than the Social Security Administration -- so much better that we can wave away concerns about increased risk -- evaporates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So Mr. Bush can defend himself against the charge of bad timing by arguing that stocks are not overvalued, that their high prices are justified because people no longer demand traditionally high rates of return. But how can he then assume that people will nonetheless get those traditional high returns -- and use that assumption as the basis for a huge policy initiative?

  In cafes, on street corners and in front of newsstands, many people in Washington Heights have been heatedly talking for weeks about the tactics of the presidential campaign and the merits of the candidates. But in their rapid-fire Spanish, they aren't speaking of Al Gore or George W. Bush. Instead, they intone the names Balaguer, Mejia and Medina, the three men seeking the presidency of the Dominican Republic.

  THE 2000 CAMPAIGN  Correction:  May 22, 2000, Monday  A picture caption on Wednesday about the graduation of Vice President's Al Gore's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff from Columbia Law School referred imprecisely to her degree. She is not the newest lawyer in her immediate family; she is the only one. While Mr. Gore's parents were both lawyers and he attended law school, he did not graduate.

  Back in December, at a town meeting in Derry, N.H., Mr. Gore indicated that he would favor allowing marijuana to be prescribed for medical purposes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He referred to a strikingly personal experience. His sister, Nancy Gore Hunger, died of lung cancer in 1984 after painful chemotherapy. She was being treated in Tennessee, where medical marijuana was legal at the time, and her doctor -- ''one of the very best in the entire world,'' Mr. Gore said -- had prescribed marijuana. She tried it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''She decided against it because she didn't like it and it didn't produce the desired results for her,'' Mr. Gore told his audience that night. ''But the doctor said, 'Look, this is an option she ought to have available, very carefully monitored and controlled.' And if it had worked for her, I think she should have had the option.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Despite what he said at the news conference, there was an unmistakable perception -- on both sides of the issue -- that Mr. Gore had signaled his support for the practice.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore still gets the occasional question on this subject, as he did last week in California, where voters approved the medicinal use of marijuana. But now, five months after his initial indication that doctors should have the ''flexibility'' to prescribe marijuana, Mr. Gore appears to have become firmer in his opposition, even though there has been no new research in the intervening months to indicate that marijuana works better or worse than anyone thought in December.

  ''Right now the science does not show me, or the experts whose judgment I trust, that it is the proper medication for pain and that there are not better alternatives available in every situation,'' Mr. Gore said in response to a student's question last Thursday at the Elizabeth Learning Center in Cudahy, Calif.

  We can continue leading this by building on the progress of the last seven years. Twenty-one million new jobs, balanced budgets, lowered crime, stronger schools, better child care, a cleaner environment, a safer and more inclusive American community. And our thanks must go to Vice President Al Gore and President Bill Clinton.

  Based on his record in keeping the expansion going, Mr. Greenspan has enjoyed widespread bipartisan support even as he has raised interest rates. Both Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have expressed confidence in him, and so far the Fed has not been an issue in the presidential campaign.

  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has reignited the debate over the future of Social Security and whether it is a good idea to allow individuals to invest some of their payroll taxes in the stock market.

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, the announcement has signaled a change in the debate. Although Vice President Al Gore has attacked the idea as inherently risky, the concept of investing some money from payroll taxes in the stock market seemed to be more acceptable today than it was several years ago.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000

  Mr. Shipman, for example, would not comment on how Mr. Bush's proposal dealt with the cost of administering the Social Security accounts of private investors because it did not provide enough detail.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He also faulted Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush for not developing proposals that he said would actually deal with the solvency of Social Security. The system will start paying out more in benefits than it is collecting in payroll taxes in 2015.
 </textdata>

  ''Neither Gore nor Bush have a plan for balancing the system,'' Mr. Mueller said.

  And what benefits would a retiree get -- and how would the Social Security system cover them -- if the retiree was allowed, as Mr. Bush proposed, to pass on the assets in the individual accounts to his or her heirs?
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Vice President Al Gore has assembled a large team of foreign policy advisers whose members could form the national security nucleus of a Gore administration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000

 <textdata>
  The current role of the advisory group is somewhat nebulous, however, since Mr. Gore has never relied on outsiders for advice on foreign policy, and the new panel has not yet contributed much of substance to his campaign.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore believes he needs to hear fresh voices on foreign policy, several Gore aides say, and he has begun to assemble a group of advisers who can address foreign policy questions during the campaign and assist in the transition should Mr. Gore win in November.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The panel includes a number of respected academics, former ambassadors and former subcabinet officers, but its members are less well known than Gov. George W. Bush's team of foreign policy advisers, who call themselves the Vulcans after the Greek god of fire and the forge.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush group includes Paul D. Wolfowitz, Richard L. Armitage, Richard Perle, Robert B. Zoellick and Stephen J. Hadley, all of whom served in senior national security posts in the Reagan and Bush administrations. Mr. Bush also consults with Richard B. Cheney, the former secretary of defense, and George P. Shultz, the former secretary of state. Condoleezza Rice, a former top Russia specialist at the National Security Council, coordinates the Bush foreign policy advisory team.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Bush needs them,'' said Marc C. Ginsberg, a longtime friend of President Clinton who served as envoy to Morocco from 1994 to 1998 and who is now one of two coordinators of the Gore foreign policy group. ''He needs the best possible A-list of foreign policy advisers to compensate for his lack of experience and knowledge. Al Gore doesn't suffer from the same deficiencies.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Their role remains indistinct and there is little evidence that Mr. Gore will turn to them for foreign policy guidance any time soon. Unlike the Bush group, they are not holding regular briefings for the vice president, who is as broadly knowledgeable about foreign policy as anyone in the Democratic Party. They have not been canvassed for policy advice or speech drafts. Nor are they authorized to speak to the press on behalf of the Gore campaign. The list of their names was produced only after repeated requests from a reporter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Nonetheless, competition for spots on the list is fierce because the group is seen as the farm team for senior jobs in a Gore administration, should the vice president win in November. Serving on the ad hoc Gore committee is also a prestigious resume addition for the part-time advisers, many of whom also advise private clients at the same time they give foreign policy counsel to the Gore campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Jentleson, who served in the State Department's office of policy planning early in the Clinton administration, said Mr. Gore was reaching beyond the Beltway for fresh ideas. He said Mr. Gore depended on Mr. Fuerth and Samuel R. Berger, the White House national security adviser, for day-to-day foreign policy guidance. Mr. Gore also consults regularly with Richard C. Holbrooke, the United Nations ambassador, whom many consider the leading candidate for secretary of state in a Gore administration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore wants to hear a range of voices as he begins to formulate an approach to global affairs that may at times differ from that of Mr. Clinton, Mr. Jentleson said. But the members of the group are well within the mainstream of the Democratic Party, generally supporting global engagement, protection of the environment and free trade, he added.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The panel is being assembled with an eye toward quickly staffing a Gore administration, Mr. Jentleson said. ''By asking them to join this group we're not making any promises, he said. ''But if Gore wins the election, it's a lot better to start on Wednesday with a group of people you know than to start looking at a pile of resumes.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Foreign policy veterans and even some advisers to Mr. Gore suggest that the group is largely window-dressing at this point, assembled in part to make it look as though Mr. Gore is not dependent wholly on his own foreign policy ideas and those of Mr. Fuerth. Membership on the panel also gives foreign policy thinkers in the Democratic Party a stake in a victory by the vice president in November.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said that Mr. Fuerth tightly controlled what reached Mr. Gore and that the two of them made all important decisions with little outside advice. Mr. Gore did not draw on the advisory group in preparing his most recent address on foreign policy, delivered on May 1 in Boston, aides said. The vice president wrote much of the speech himself, with assistance from Mr. Fuerth and other members of the White House national security staff, they said. In the speech, Mr. Gore called for an activist foreign policy of ''forward engagement'' and criticized Mr. Bush for hewing to what he called an obsolete cold-war mentality.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Fuerth said the outside advisers would become more active as the campaign progressed, serving as surrogate speakers, drafting speeches and responding to press questions on national security matters. But they will never serve as the foreign policy ''brain'' of the Gore operation. That job is already taken, Mr. Fuerth said.

  A reporter for Glamour magazine, David France, interviewed Governor Bush on ''women's issues'' by playing a game of ''verbal Rorschach'':  ''I was rattling off names and concepts, and he was telling me the first thought that came to his mind.'' (W. still likes to live dangerously.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. France said ''Phyllis Schlafly.'' Mr. Bush replied, ''Icon of the conservative right.'' Mr. France said ''Madonna.'' Mr. Bush replied, ''I'm not into pop music.'' Mr. France said ''Gloria Steinem.'' Mr. Bush replied, ''Uh, pioneer.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. France said ''Sex and the City.'' Mr. Bush's face ''blistered in a purple fury,'' and his eyes narrowed and glowered. The candidate clearly thought he was being challenged on his claim of monogamy or support of teenage abstinence.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000

  Gordon Johndroe, Mr. Bush's press aide, tried to clear up the confusion. ''Governor,'' he said, ''it's an HBO television show.''

  EYE ON 2004 RACE? -- Though this year's presidential primary season is not officially over, a coming fund-raiser in Georgia is already stoking speculation about races four years or so down the road. Next Monday, Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic governor of New Hampshire, will be the beneficiary of an event in Atlanta -- a bit south of Concord -- that planners hope will raise at least $25,000 for her re-election. And one of the hosts, as well as one of the contributors, will be Georgia's governor, Roy Barnes, a first-term Democrat who is beginning to win national attention for his policies on improving schools and limiting sprawl. Robert S. Kahn, Mr. Barnes's chief of staff, says his boss was simply supporting a fellow Democratic governor, not pocketing a chit to be cashed later, in time for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary in 2004 or 2008. ''The only election he's interested in, other than legislative elections, is his own re-election,'' Mr. Kahn insisted. The event is being organized by Michael Coles, a prominent party fund-raiser and Barnes ally who met Ms. Shaheen while working for Vice President Al Gore in New Hampshire last winter.

  In an October 1999 letter from Vice President Al Gore to Mr. Putin, who was then the prime minister, the Clinton administration complained that Russia was failing to take action against Russian institutions that were still assisting Iran's missile program. Mr. Savelyev said the letter was read to him by a member of Mr. Putin's staff.

  MR. McCAIN. -- I endorse Governor Bush. I endorse -- I endorse Governor Bush. I endorse Governor Bush. I endorse Governor Bush. I endorse Governor Bush. I endorse Governor Bush. I endorse Governor ----
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Q. -- Does that have to do with the feelings you still have about the primary that you ran and the bitterness you had at the time about some of the tactics that Governor Bush used?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. McCAIN. -- Look, the only way you can approach American politics and seeking elective office is to move forward. For me to look back in anger or with any rancor would be a mistake. It would harm me; it would harm Governor Bush, and it would harm those who supported me in this campaign. I look forward and not back. I hold no rancor. Others will be the judge of this campaign, not me.

  And it's going to be a big difference of opinion between what he and I believe and what Vice President Gore believes. Vice President Gore's willing to accept the status quo. He's willing to think the current system is going to work. And we don't. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000

 <textdata>
  Q. -- Senator, can you tell us what, in your view, is the single most important reason why Al Gore should not be president?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. McCAIN. -- I think the single most important reason is that Governor Bush is the most qualified person to be president of the United States. He has the vision; he has the knowledge and the expertise to carry out the mission of maintaining United States supremacy, both militarily and economically in the world.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  I think that it's clear that Governor Bush's philosophy, his ideals and his ability to articulate a vision for the future is the major reason why he should be president of the United States and not Al Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And I want to emphasize one more time, and I made it very clear to Governor Bush, I will continue to pursue the issues of reform. That is the agenda that drove me in my campaign and will drive me as long as I am in public service. I believe we will have disagreements, but I also believe we will have a lot more agreements than disagreements. And I think our discussions and our debate will be healthy, and in the long run helpful to the party and the country.

  McCain Endorses Bush, Citing Goals and Values  Senator John McCain endorsed Gov. George W. Bush and pledged to help the de facto Republican presidential nominee win the White House for their party.

Mr. McCain indicated that common goals and shared values transcended the animosity that grew out of their campaign.

  For a defeated candidate in the Republican presidential race, Senator John McCain has not suffered from lack of attention. With his high poll numbers, Mr. McCain might have made a credible  third-party candidate in November. Yesterday, however, he took the prudent course and endorsed Gov. George W. Bush, joking that he preferred taking his medicine now rather than later. Clearly he figured that he had a brighter future inside the G.O.P. than as a spoiler outside it. It was disappointing that Mr. Bush offered no concessions on campaign reform or other issues in return for an endorsement he really needed.

  In approaching the meeting with Mr. McCain yesterday, Mr. Bush seemed to have this history in mind. He made it clear that he wanted the senator's endorsement, but did not want to seem to want it too much. In their joint news conference the governor tried to stress how much they had in common. But he did not look especially pleased about Mr. McCain's vow to continue pressing his agenda. He may have been wondering whether the senator would try to do that at the convention in Philadelphia this summer.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  The continuing popularity of Mr. McCain can be seen in many surveys, including a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showing that 23 percent of the voters would prefer him over Mr. Bush or Vice President Al Gore. The USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll shows him with higher approval ratings than either man. The Bush campaign has always been quick to assert that Mr. McCain got his biggest victories in states where independents and Democrats could join with Republicans and vote in the primary. But it is these independent-minded voters who will determine the winner in November. It will not be easy for either Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore, both wealthy political heirs, to attract voters who are drawn to Mr. McCain's outsider appeal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, for his part, has been resistant to identifying with two issues that seem intrinsic to Mr. McCain's appeal. One is campaign finance reform, particularly the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban, which Mr. Bush opposes. Another is Mr. McCain's opposition to a gigantic tax cut that would use up the budget surplus. Mr. Bush probably feels locked in on taxes, but he would be smart to adopt Mr. McCain's stand on campaign finance reform. Otherwise he may find that McCain voters are as hard to get as the senator's endorsement was.

  Two former presidents and an array of senior officials from Democratic and Republican administrations rallied today with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore at the White House to urge Congress to approve a landmark China trade bill.

  Sandwiched between Mr. Clinton and the former presidents in turns at the microphone, Mr. Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, appeared reluctant to give his full-throated endorsement. His words sounded like support. But his subdued tone suggested the pains that Mr. Gore has taken to avoid alienating a pivotal ally, organized labor, which opposes the accord.

  ''It is right for American jobs, it is right for the cause of reform in China, and I believe it will move us closer to the strong and stable world community that we all seek to create,'' Mr. Gore said.

  Citing common goals and shared values that transcended any of the bitterness between them, Senator John McCain at last endorsed Gov. George W. Bush today and pledged to help him achieve what Mr. McCain had wanted so badly for himself: a seat behind the desk in the Oval Office.

  ''I look forward to enthusiastically campaigning for Governor Bush for the next six months,'' Mr. McCain said at a news conference here that was attended by more than 100 members of the news media, a reflection of just how unpredictable and closely watched the interactions between the Arizona senator and the Texas governor had become.

  ''I believe that it's very important that we restore integrity and honor to the White House,'' Mr. McCain said. ''I'm convinced that Governor Bush can do that more than adequately.'' [Excerpts, Page A28.]

  The announcement by Mr. McCain, which followed his private 90-minute meeting with Mr. Bush, heralded a new phase in a rocky political relationship that went from remarkable amity in December to extraordinary animosity in March and a tense, delicate dance of reconciliation over the last two months.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even more important, Mr. McCain's formal endorsement allowed Mr. Bush to lay claim to a unified party, to put an important piece of unfinished business behind him and to reach out to independent and swing voters with the blessing of Mr. McCain, who had proved to be alluring to that group in the primaries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But aides to Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain and political analysts said it remained unclear just how much work Mr. McCain would do on Mr. Bush's behalf -- and just how thoroughly the wounds of a lacerating primary season had healed. Mr. McCain's often tepid demeanor and restrained language today only heightened those questions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He repeated several times that his support for Governor Bush did not alter or diminish his commitment to an overhaul of campaign funding laws that was more sweeping than the plan favored by Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He did not actually use the words ''endorse'' or ''endorsement'' until reporters pressed him to make sure they understood correctly what was going on. At that point, Mr. McCain made something of a comedy routine, saying, ''I endorse Governor Bush,'' six times in a row. And when one journalist asked Mr. McCain if his actions today -- an almost inevitable obligation for any politician wishing to remain loyal to his party -- were like swallowing a dose of necessary medicine sooner rather than later, Mr. McCain answered, ''I think 'take the medicine now' probably is a good description.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides chose to interpret the ambiguous remark as an example of the senator's sometimes deadpan humor, and it did not diminish their conviction, shared by many Republican operatives, that the Texas governor had accomplished something important today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McCain also made clear today that he had told Mr. Bush what he had been saying publicly for some time: that he had no interest in the vice presidency. He and Mr. Bush said they had discussed other strong candidates, including Governors Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and John Engler of Michigan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In accepting Mr. McCain's endorsement, Mr. Bush heaped praise on him, providing a stark contrast to some of the dismissive remarks that he and his aides had made about Mr. McCain after Mr. Bush effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination in mid-March.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I told him point blank he made me a better candidate,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to their meeting in a room of the Westin William Penn hotel here. ''He waged a really good campaign and put me through my paces. And as a result of the campaign, I stand better prepared to become the president, which is exactly what I intend to do.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''For me to look back in anger or with any rancor would be a mistake,'' he said. ''It would harm me. It would harm Governor Bush. And it would harm those who supported me in this campaign.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the tone of his remarks suggested that his ire and that of his aides over the negative tactics used by Mr. Bush and his supporters in the primaries had not dissipated.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That anger was rekindled today when Mr. Bush dodged a question about whether he would repudiate a  statement by the evangelist Pat Robertson two days ago that choosing Mr. McCain as a vice president would be dangerous.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Rick Davis, who had managed Mr. McCain's campaign, said of the Bush response: ''I'm very disappointed. I don't think there's a Republican around who doesn't think Pat Robertson's comments Sunday were outside the mainstream of our party. What's the harm of saying that?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Political analysts said Mr. McCain's eventual endorsement of Mr. Bush was never really in much doubt, in part because the senator, seen as something of a maverick in his own party, needed to show his  peers that he could follow the loyal, polite course. That would be critical if Mr. Bush loses and Mr. McCain seeks to become the party's nominee four years from now.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the road leading to this point was bumpy, and it was not clear until Monday that this morning's meeting, scheduled a month ago, would bring the waiting to an end. Mr. McCain's previous statements that he would support the party's nominee fell short of a formal seal of approval and fueled speculation, which Mr. Bush's aides were eager to quell, about what was taking so long.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The two men's aides said Mr. Bush did not offer Mr. McCain anything concrete in exchange for his support. And one McCain supporter said efforts by the aides to hammer out a document detailing joint policy goals had failed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. McCain's aides have let Bush campaign officials know that the Arizona senator would like a prominent speaking role at the Republican National Convention, and the Bush campaign has indicated interest in making that happen.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Coming out of the meeting, both Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush acknowledged that they still had policy disagreements, although they declined to linger on them. During the primaries, for example, Mr. McCain repeatedly asserted that the size of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut might jeopardize the health of Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. McCain's vision of campaign finance reform, for example, includes bans on unlimited donations to political parties from both corporations and individuals; Mr. Bush does not think individual contributions should be limited.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides to both politicians said there had not yet been any discussion about specific ways in which Mr. McCain could or would bolster Mr. Bush's campaign.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore really wanted to get in on the McCain-Bush act.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Gore, who has been lagging in the polls behind Mr. Bush, is still overtly courting the independent-minded voters who were attracted to Mr. McCain's candidacy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On April 30, Mr. Gore met privately with Mr. McCain at the Naval Observatory here, the vice president's official residence. And today, his little humor routine aside, Mr. Gore used his speech to about 450 members of the Anti-Defamation League to draw a contrast between Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Without naming the two Republicans, Mr. Gore said it was wrong not to condemn South Carolina's flying the Confederate battle flag atop the Statehouse in Columbia. Mr. Bush has said repeatedly that it is up to the state to decide whether to bring it down. Mr. McCain said the same thing in the Republican primaries, but last month he expressed regret for not having spoken out against the flag, saying he was afraid that such a stand would have cost him votes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said today of the flag issue: ''We know it is wrong not only to support it, but to find it impossible to summon the moral courage to speak out about it. It is wrong to remain silent about it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's remarks allowed room for Mr. McCain's reversal but not for Mr. Bush's continued refusal to condemn the flying of the flag.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The speech was an official one as vice president, and the league is a tax-exempt organization that cannot endorse political candidates. But it was certainly a political speech, designed to paint Mr. Bush as an extremist and undermine any impression that Mr. McCain's endorsement might make Mr. Bush more acceptable to independents.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Independent voters are definitely on Mr. Gore's mind. Much of his campaign since March, when he won enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination, has been geared toward swing voters in battleground states like Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. And just as he has been wooing McCain supporters, Mr. Gore has also been going after the backers of Jesse Ventura, the independent governor of Minnesota.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As it happened, Mr. Ventura was at the White House this morning for a pep rally in support of permanent trade relations with China, and Mr. Gore singled him out for thanks, among others, as did President Clinton. Last month, Mr. Gore also had a private dinner with Governor Ventura and his wife at the vice-presidential residence.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The gateway topic for Mr. Gore to cozy up to both Mr. McCain and Mr. Ventura has been overhauling the campaign finance system, and aides said they expected the vice president to explore the topic publicly with both as the campaign progressed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's commitments included support for a national law against hate crimes. This amounted to another dig at Mr. Bush, who critics have said failed to shepherd through such a law in Texas. In a speech that extolled the virtues of tolerance, he sprinkled his comments with references to famous Jews.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Freud once spoke about the narcissism of slight difference, just as Einstein taught that the most destructive power known on earth is within the smallest state we know -- the inside of the atom,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The smallest differences sometimes unleash the most horrific violence.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, Howard Berkowitz, national chairman of the league, said it was concerned that both candidates were injecting too much religion into the campaign. ''We want to make sure that one candidate doesn't out-religion the other,'' he said, citing Mr. Bush's comment that Jesus was his favorite philosopher. ''These things are better left in private,'' Mr. Berkowitz said.

  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, whom Mr. Gregg strongly supported in the New Hampshire presidential primary, has not addressed blocking the peacekeeping money, said Condoleeza Rice, Mr. Bush's chief foreign policy adviser. ''Obviously,'' Ms. Rice said, ''the administration has some very hard work to do with Congress over the peacekeeping issue.''

  PITTING BROTHER AGAINST BROTHER -- Trying to foment a bit of sibling discord, the Gore campaign yesterday circulated a newspaper article by Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida that seemed to contradict a plan by his brother Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to allow taxpayers to invest some Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market. In an April 18 op-ed piece in The Tallahassee Democrat, Jeb Bush argued that, because of the stock market's volatility, the state pension system should put part of its $12 billion surplus in a fund that would be reserved for a downturn. ''It makes sense that we take the surplus we have now and place it in a reserve that is not affected by changes in the market,'' he wrote. Mr. Gore's aides said that suggested Mr. Bush wants to withdraw some pension funds from the stock market. A spokesman for Jeb Bush said the Gore campaign had misread the article.

  SEEKING RUNNING-MATE SUGGESTIONS -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas sent letters to 450 Republicans yesterday seeking advice on a running mate. In the three-paragraph request, which went to United States senators, representatives, governors, state Republican committee members, state party chairmen and Bush for President committees, the governor said: ''My primary concern is to select someone who is capable of serving as president of the United States. I am interested in your thoughts as to individuals whom I should consider as well as any particular issues you believe I should take into account.'' Separately, in a Fox News television interview, Mr. Bush repeated that while he opposed abortion, he would accept a running mate who favored abortion rights -- within limits. Some leaders of the religious right have said Mr. Bush risks losing support should he pick a supporter of abortion rights.

  Competing Social Security Plans  Social Security is slowly going broke, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas agree, but they differ on the solutions for fixing it. Mr. Gore would channel the benefits of the federal budget surplus into the system. Governor Bush would establish private investment accounts through which workers could seek higher returns on their contributions to the retirement system. [A23.]

 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Eager to know what Mr. Bush might say in private to conservative leaders, Mr. Porteous sent for audiotapes of the conference. The council sells audiotapes of conferences to members only, but the institute had obtained an order form from the company, Skynet Media, that handles the recording.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So when a package arrived earlier this year, Mr. Porteous thought success was at hand. But the tape of Mr. Bush's speech was not included.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Morton C. Blackwell, the council's executive director, said all speakers were asked for permission to include their remarks on the tapes and that the Bush campaign had declined.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The Bush entourage said they preferred that the tape not go out, though I could not see any reason why they shouldn't,'' Mr. Blackwell said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that if anyone was ''hoping to hear something that the governor would say that he hasn't said publicly, then they're on a wild goose chase.'' He declined to characterize the speech, saying, ''When we go to meetings that are private, they remain private.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000

  But Mr. Blackwell said the Bush campaign should have a copy.

  The outcome was close enough, and important enough for the administration, that Vice President Al Gore presided over the roll-call, prepared to cast a tie-breaking vote if needed. ''To have been forced to withdraw in this manner would have demoralized our allies and emboldened those in the region who favor violence as a solution to their disputes,'' Mr. Gore said in a statement.

  Fifteen of the 55 Republicans voted for a Democratic amendment to strike the withdrawal language from the $8.6 billion military construction spending bill. At least two or three Republicans said they were swayed by Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but many others were not, and they could challenge him on foreign policy if he becomes President.

  Mrs. Gore is reluctant to talk about the public-private balancing act, but campaign aides said she was fearful of how a presidential campaign might consume her family life. At times the Gores' 26-year-old daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, seems more comfortable in the public spotlight than her mother.  (Karenna is an adviser to the Gore campaign, but her siblings -- Kristin, who is 23; Sarah, 21; and Albert 3d, 17 -- have kept lower profiles.)
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mrs. Gore ''wants to maintain her individuality,'' an aide to Mr. Gore said. ''That will be a struggle.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even as the campaign heats up, Mrs. Gore said, she hopes to continue activities she does now with relative anonymity -- like searching out the homeless at night and encouraging them into shelters, or going out with her husband to see movies in actual theaters, rather than in private screening rooms.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Gore defends those efforts, which led to the recording industry's placement of warning labels on albums that contained explicit content.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Gore may insist on her privacy -- Friday is the Gores' 30th wedding anniversary, an occasion that her husband has trumpeted on the campaign trail, but that she wants to be spent privately -- but also lives a public life.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Earlier this month, for instance, she appeared on stage at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington and played the drums in front of 45,000 people at a concert on the eve of a gay rights march. (Mrs. Gore played the drums in a girl group, the Wildcats, in high school and is surely the only candidate's wife to have played with members of the Grateful Dead.)
 </textdata>

  At a recent speech in Virginia to the parents of gays and lesbians, Mrs. Gore talked in a soft, hesitant voice about the need for ''unconditional love.'' But she also advocates on behalf of her husband's causes. At a union event last week in Cincinnati, she called for equal pay for women.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Campaign advisers said Mrs. Gore had ''a seat at the table'' but this is more figurative than literal. She is not involved in the day-to-day tactical discussions or strategy conference calls, they said. But she is perceived as a valuable asset who can cover the so-called secondary media markets. Her real value, said those who know her well, is helping Mr. Gore relax and keeping the family's priorities in front of him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Gore does not much like to describe how she would see her role as first lady or to compare herself with Mrs. Clinton. But from all indications, she would be in the more traditional mold.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In an interview last year with The Associated Press, Mrs. Gore said: ''With four children and aging parents, I find that I only spend so much time on issues that I care about, and I spend a lot of time on keeping the family together.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Gore's counterpart on the Republican side, Laura Bush, has also seemed somewhat uncomfortable in the spotlight. She was a reluctant participant in George W. Bush's first political race, in 1978, and was not eager for him to run for governor of Texas or for the presidency.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, the traditional campaign role of chief family helpmate sometimes seems to be occupied by her daughter Karenna, who graduated from Columbia Law School on Tuesday. Mrs. Schiff has emerged as an influential adviser to her father, particularly on addressing concerns of  her generation. And Mr. Gore appears keen on grooming her for a life in politics.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Over the years, and especially in this campaign, Mr. Gore has sent mixed signals about what he views as private, often drawing on his family archives to help soften his image.

  When Mr. Gore and his son hiked up Mount Rainier last summer, reporters were not told of the outing until the two had reached bottom. But before the Washington State primary this year, his campaign used the trek in a commercial.

  Ms. Ireland said she did not expect Mrs. Gore ''to be out there articulating the intricacy of issues,'' but that she could help gain respect for full-time mothers and homemakers.

  Not for nothing do the members of Maverick Media, the organization assembled for the express goal of cultivating Mr. Bush's appeal on radio and television, operate out of a basement warren of offices they call the bunker: the first steady, 30-second barrages of the general election have not even been set off yet, and already the Bush message people are crying foul.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But when the opposition consists of the likes of Carter Eskew and Robert Shrum, veteran media strategists for Vice President Al Gore who have take-no-prisoners reputations, the question arises: Does Mr. Bush need a team that plays by the Marquess of Queensberry rules, or by Mike Tyson's? Can Maverick avoid the errors made in Bill Bradley's political advertising, which never adequately answered Mr. Gore's incessant criticisms?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That sensibility is reflected in many of the spots Mr. McKinnon creates for Mr. Bush, warm and fuzzy images reminiscent of the upbeat advertisements for Ronald Reagan. The McKinnon style is more documentary; the innovation Maverick introduced in the primaries was the ''crash ad,'' filmed, edited and on the air in 24 hours.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And his spots feature lots of shimmering boilerplate: shots of Mr. Bush wading into smiling crowds, posed in dazzling sunshine with his wife, Laura, or offering his family-sampler takes on heart-tugging issues. ''I believe every child can learn,'' he said in one education spot.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McKinnon and company know they cannot run their campaign on happy talk; indeed, alongside the sunny spots, Mr. Bush and his allies ran some of the harshest commercials of the primaries, including attack ads that portrayed Senator McCain as an enemy of the environment and breast cancer research.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And the question of tone is not their only challenge. Although Mr. Bush is an immensely likable candidate, questions about his grasp of foreign affairs and other issues could be magnified in comparisons with Mr. Gore, and some political observers wonder if Maverick will be able to fill in the gaps.
 </textdata>

  ''Here's the hard thing,'' said Paul Begala, a former adviser to President Clinton who has known and liked Mr. McKinnon since their days together at the University of Texas. ''Mark's greatest strength is style, and Bush has a style that meshes well with Mark's. In small settings Bush is very charming: the most charming politician to come down the pike since Clinton. Mark does an excellent job of capturing that. But at the end of the day there is no filter that can be put on a camera to add gray matter.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The question of depth is clearly one of the candidate's most vexing image problems. The governor's media advisers, though, maintain that such doubts about Mr. Bush exist in a land where political commentators reside, but not the voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As he sat in a windowless conference room ringed with television sets, the affable Mr. McKinnon would not be coaxed into a meditation on any of Mr. Bush's perceived weaknesses. If it seemed a function of a political advertising man's natural inclination to project only the bright side, it also reflected what those who know him say is Mr. McKinnon's genuine belief in Mr. Bush, a deep and abiding affection characteristic of those in the governor's inner circle.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Former Mayor Bob Lanier of Houston, for whom Mr. McKinnon made commercials in all three of his successful mayoral campaigns, says there can be only one explanation for Mr. McKinnon's signing up: ''If he's supporting George Bush, it's because he thinks George Bush would make a good president.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If there are conventional routes to making  commercials for this potential president, Mr. McKinnon did not take them. For one thing, he climbed the wrong ladder: he was  a longtime Democratic media strategist before signing up with Mr. Bush, working on the campaigns of, among others, former Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas and former Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000

  In fact, Mr. McKinnon, a Colorado-born musician who in his younger days was invited to Nashville to write songs for Kris Kristofferson, had dropped out of politics entirely by the time he fell into a long conversation with Mr. Bush in a chance encounter at a dinner in Austin in 1997. The year before, Mr. McKinnon confessed in a most public way -- a first-person article for Texas Monthly -- that after 15 years of politics, he was burned out.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At that Austin dinner, though, Mr. McKinnon's head was turned. Mr. Bush seemed to him to evince an honest interest in education, an issue dear to Mr. McKinnon; he was making a documentary about the inspirational founder of a Houston charter school. ''I was amazed, blown away, by how much attention he paid,'' Mr. McKinnon said of the governor, and before long he had signed up to handle media in Mr. Bush's 1998 campaign for re-election as governor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That is high praise from a McCain aide, considering how aggrieved his boss felt by some of the commercials Mr. Bush ran in South Carolina.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign had been expecting the most intense media battering to come from the campaign of another primary-election opponent, Steve Forbes, but it was Mr. McCain who surprised Mr. Bush with the harder hitting commercials, including one in New Hampshire in which Mr. McCain said Mr. Bush's tax cuts would mostly benefit the wealthy. Some of Mr. Bush's advisers believe that their failure to answer the commercial was a major factor in their sobering early loss in New Hampshire.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But by South Carolina they had learned from their mistake. In one of the most effective strategies of the primary season, Mr. Bush was able to turn Mr. McCain's clean-campaign vows against him. In an advertisement shot at a fishing camp in South Carolina, a serious-looking Mr. Bush responded to a McCain commercial in which the senator accused the governor of twisting the truth, ''like Clinton.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Disagree with me, fine,'' Mr. Bush intoned in his advertisement of reply. ''But do not challenge my integrity.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Mark made the best ad of the primaries when Bush looked into the camera and said, 'He compared me to Clinton,' '' said Mr. Begala, now a commentator on CNBC's ''Equal Time.'' ''It gave Bush carte blanche to turn his guns on McCain.''

  Social Security is slowly going broke, says Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and the best way to avoid painful benefit cuts or tax increases is to establish private investment accounts through which workers could seek higher returns on their contributions to the retirement system.

  Mr. Bush has not provided a detailed plan. But most privatization proposals call for diverting two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax into accounts that would be owned and controlled by individuals. A worker earning $50,000 a year would have $1,000 a year going to a private account.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign notes that stocks earned an average annual return, after inflation, of 7.2 percent from 1926 to 1997. By contrast, workers born after 1963 can expect on average a return from their Social Security contributions of 1.9 percent, according to Social Security statistics cited by the Bush campaign.
 </textdata>

  Private accounts would provide a start on Social Security solvency  over 75 years, the standard normally used in assessing the system's health, Mr. Bush has said. He has acknowledged that other steps, like benefit cuts, would be needed to finish closing the gap, but has not said what steps he would support.

  The Gore Approach
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore starts with the premise that the current system should be left more or less intact. His plan is built on the idea that there should be a way to use the current budget surplus to help Social Security down the road. While the basic idea may be simple, the way the government handles its finances makes executing it quite complicated.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Starting in 2011, Mr. Gore would funnel to Social Security an amount of money equal to the annual interest savings from debt reduction -- $100 billion a year at first, growing to more than $200 billion a year by 2015. Mr. Gore says the infusion would extend Social Security's solvency to 2054 from 2037 without having to cut benefits or otherwise alter the system.

  Mr. Gore has extensive experience in the Senate and as an active vice president, and is well informed on national and foreign affairs. Mr. Bush has had limited experience as the governor of a single state.

  Both men have made mistakes, but it seems that when Mr. Bush makes a mistake showing a lack of knowledge or understanding, people don't take it seriously -- they sort of expect it -- yet when Mr. Gore makes a mistake (as with his interference in the case of Elian Gonzalez), he is castigated.

  With his recent statements on China trade and the deployment of American troops in Kosovo, Gov. George W. Bush has placed himself squarely in a Republican tradition of favoring internationalism and presidential supremacy in foreign policy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, even though the Senate today by a vote of 53-47 shelved a measure -- opposed by President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Bush alike -- that could have terminated American military participation in Kosovo next July, it was mostly Democrats who ensured the provision's defeat.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Only 15 of the 55 Senate Republicans heeded Mr. Bush's warnings that this was a ''legislative overreach'' that would step on the foreign policy prerogatives of the next president. Among those who voted to keep a Kosovo withdrawal deadline was the majority leader, Trent Lott.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Moreover, this is not an isolated vote. Even though most Congressional Republicans are rallying behind President Clinton on granting normalized trade relations with China, legislation that Mr. Bush also supports, this is an issue of paramount importance to Republicans' business constituency.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Across other areas of foreign policy, where business is less of a factor, there have been a host of occasions over the past years in which Congress has declared independence from the president on foreign policy and shown a suspicion of mutlilateral engagements. Certainly the idea -- which Mr. Bush was trying to re-establish in his statement on Kosovo -- that Congress bows to the president on foreign policy has long disappeared.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A key question is how much of this could come back to haunt Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many Republicans say that Mr. Bush would not face problems from a Republican Congress -- that many of these votes across the years have stemmed not from Republican isolationismbut from the poisonous relations between Congress and Mr. Clinton.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000

  ''What this is about on the Republican side is a deep dislike and distrust for President Clinton, '' said SenatorChuck Hagel of Nebraska, one of the 15 Republicans who joined with Democrats to defeat the time limit on funds for the deployment. Mr. Hagel had reached out last week to Mr. Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, to alert the Bush campaign of the implications of pending Kosovo vote and find out where Mr. Bush stood.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Hagel said today that he thought only eight of the Senate Republicans truly reject internationalism. ''If you have a President Bush,'' he said ''you'll find all this settle down considerably in the Republican caucus next year. There will be a new found trust and confidence that he's our guy. And if our guy says it's okay to be in Kosovo, that makes somewhat of a difference.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Moreover, Mr. Bush is more in sync with Republicans in Congress on a number of foreign policy issues. He is interested in building a robust antiballistic missile defense and like Mr. Helms has said he would rather leave it up to the next president, not Mr. Clinton, to negotiate with the Russians on the issue. He did not split with Senate Republicans when they voted down the test ban treaty last year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And when Mr. Bush called for a ''distinctly American internationalism'' in a major foreign policy speech last year, he said that while America must be involved in the world, ''that does not mean our military is the answer to every difficult foreign policy situation -- a substitute for strategy.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Vice President Al Gore has also wielded the isolationist label against Mr. Bush. The vice president recently accused him of being ''stuck in a cold war mindset.'' Stressing Mr. Bush's lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Gore added, ''One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said he had confidence that Mr. Bush, as president, would immediately set a time limit for disengagement in Kosovo. But if Mr. Bush did not do so, Mr. Hutchinson said, ''I think you'd see efforts to set deadlines and Congres would move to try to disengage there regardless if there's a President Gore or a President Bush.''

In Sunday's episode, Mr. Gore arrives with a band he calls his Vice Presidential Action Rangers (also doing their own guest voices), including Uhura from ''Star Trek'' (Nichelle Nichols) and Stephen Hawking.

  With the system in need of more revenue, not less, diverting part of the payroll tax into private accounts, as Mr. Bush proposes, appears irresponsible, unless, of course, you make up the difference by cutting benefits. Without such cuts, privatization would dig the financing hole even deeper, which is why thoughtful privatization proposals generally include significant tax increases to make good on promises that have already been made. But Mr. Bush has not proposed any. This is no minor omission. Diverting 2 percentage points of the payroll tax into individual accounts would drain trillions of dollars from Social Security over the next quarter-century.

  The Bush plan not only would imperil Social Security's finances, but would add new elements of cost and risk to the retirement security of millions of Americans. Privatization is superficially attractive for two main reasons: the higher returns that can presumably be earned, say, in the stock market, and the virtues of individual choice. That's all well and good for financially sophisticated Americans, who happen (by no coincidence) also to enjoy every other advantage in our society, and who, by the way, do not rely heavily on Social Security for their retirement income. But what about the less fortunate citizens, the ones who will need to live on their Social Security checks but who may not know the difference between a stock and a bond?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000

 <textdata>
  Finally, let's remember the central idea behind the Social Security system: to provide social insurance. Both words matter. High-wage earners like me would undoubtedly be better off under the Bush proposal, and even better off under full privatization. After all, universal social insurance forces us to remain in the same pool with, and partially subsidize, those who are less fortunate. Social Security's benefit formula offers a better rate of return to lower-wage individuals.

Although his financial disclosure form lists dividend income, the stock is held in trust for his mother, and the income goes only to her.

  Faced with a new warning by a prominent religious conservative against selecting a running mate who supports a right to abortion, Gov. George W. Bush today called himself ''a pretty independent thinker'' whose main criterion for a vice-presidential nominee was an ability to assume the presidency.

  Mr. Bush spoke of his vice-presidential search as he stood beside Colin L. Powell, the retired general and Republican dream candidate who refuses to seek elective office. General Powell, prompted by reporters' questions, repeated his wish to see the anti-abortion plank removed from the Republican platform. And he once again said he would not be interested in being Mr. Bush's running mate.

  The day's event had not been devised for talk of abortion politics. In the garden of the Governor's Mansion, Mr. Bush and General Powell  signed an agreement in which Texas and America's Promise, the general's volunteer group to help the nation's youth, vowed to work together.

  But the subsequent news conference quickly turned to the jousting inside the Republican Party over Mr. Bush's choice of a running mate, just a day after the religious conservative James C. Dobson told reporters that Mr. Bush ''sounds a whole lot more conservative when he is talking to conservatives and a whole lot more moderate when he is talking to moderates.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000

 <textdata>
  Dr. Dobson accused Mr. Bush of sacrificing the party's core principles and called on him to choose a running mate opposed to abortion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked his response, Mr. Bush gave neither a nod to Dr. Dobson's concerns nor a hint where his running mate would stand on abortion. ''I appreciate advice,'' the governor said. ''I'm getting it from all corners. But I'm a pretty independent thinker.'' And, he said, his political message is always consistent. ''It's basically this: we're going to trust people, not government,'' he said.

  Pressed several times on whether he was listening to either conservatives or abortion-rights Republicans about the choice of a vice-presidential nominee, Mr. Bush listed some of his criteria for selecting a running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush repeated his position that the Republican platform's plank against abortion should remain intact. General Powell, asked whether he agreed, said: ''I would work to remove it. But good friends can disagree on issues, so I don't see that there is a big fight over that.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, who has been positioning himself close to the political center, faces a major decision on whether he can afford to select a running mate, like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who backs abortion rights.  In a New York Times/CBS News survey this month, 3 of every 10 Republican voters polled said they would be less likely to support Mr. Bush if he picked a running mate who backed a right to abortion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As reporters tried and failed several times to draw Mr. Bush out on how much he was weighing abortion in his choice of a running mate, he seemed to grow impatient.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush did say, in an interview with The Associated Press, that he was not considering either General Powell or Senator John McCain, taking them at their word that they did not want the job.

  It seems fitting that the first presidential campaign of the new century should confront the most dangerous military legacy of the last century, nuclear arms. Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore initiated an important and healthy debate in recent days about how best to reduce nuclear arsenals and diminish the threat of an accidental or intentional nuclear conflict. America's security will be best protected if the next president moves boldly to cut nuclear arms without suddenly overturning the carefully calibrated balance between offensive and defensive weapons that has long been central to preserving the peace.

  Mr. Bush, like Ronald Reagan in the 1980's, is impatient with the balance. The impulse is understandable. The primary deterrent to war is the chilling notion of mutual assured destruction, which requires Washington and Moscow to maintain sufficient nuclear firepower to annihilate one another. That balance of terror has always been unsettling and should be supplanted by a less threatening calculus. Placing a greater emphasis on defensive systems, as Mr. Bush proposes, is alluring.

  But there are disabling problems with Mr. Bush's desire to make an antimissile shield a centerpiece of his nuclear strategy. For one thing, the technology to destroy even a handful of incoming warheads in outer space remains elusive. Intercepting just one warhead has proved difficult in recent tests. For another, an abrupt shift to defensive strategies would invite Moscow to increase its nuclear arsenal to ensure that it could overwhelm even a limited American antimissile system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But that is just the risk that Mr. Bush takes by emphasizing the immediate development of a robust antimissile defense. Apart from questions of cost and technology -- the United States has already wasted billions of dollars chasing this goal -- Mr. Bush's approach will tempt Washington to break out of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The pact limits the defensive systems that Washington and Moscow can construct. An American breakout would unravel the arms control work of six presidents, and encourage China to join a new arms race to overcome the shield.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even Mr. Bush's own arms reduction proposals would be threatened. Many of the ideas he presented this week were constructive and creative. Mr. Bush made clear his commitment to seek deeper cuts than those provided under the last arms reduction treaty. The 1993 agreement requires Washington and Moscow to slash the number of long-range warheads from roughly 6,000 on each side to half that count. Mr. Bush seemed comfortable with eventually leaving each country with 2,000 to 2,500 long-range weapons. Drawing on the positive example his father set as president, Mr. Bush also said he would consider eliminating some American missiles and lowering the alert status of others on his own to encourage Moscow to respond in kind.

  Gov. George W. Bush's proposal this week to consider unilateral reductions in the American nuclear arsenal was a break with decades of strategic doctrine, a break that may foretell the end of traditional theories of arms control.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In Mr. Bush's vision, still lacking in many details, the threat of global annihilation -- or ''mutual assured destruction'' -- would no longer govern relations between the United States and other powers. The size of the American nuclear arsenal would no longer depend on the number of warheads that Russia possesses, nor be set in lengthy and painstaking arms control negotiations.

  Years later, arms control is suddenly back at center stage in a presidential campaign that was expected to focus on domestic policy. And some of those same advisers who pushed Mr. Reagan away from his radical views on arms control are now advising Governor Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, as he gives new voice to the idea of large cuts in offensive weapons, coupled with construction of missile defenses, and places it squarely on the current political agenda.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and his advisers argue that it is long past time for a radical reassessment of nuclear armaments. The idea of holding populations hostage to annihilation is worse than immoral, they say; it is irrelevant. They complain that President Clinton has wasted much of the decade since the end of the cold war by clinging to the orthodoxy of using the specter of ''mutual assured destruction'' to deter any nuclear power from contemplating a first strike.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000

 <textdata>
  ''It's way past time for some fresh thinking about the structure of military capability in light of the kind of world we now live in,'' said George P. Shultz, secretary of state in the Reagan administration and one of Mr. Bush's foreign policy advisers. ''That really hasn't been done.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Shultz, who was well known as a skeptic about Mr. Reagan's vision of a space-based umbrella to shield the United States from nuclear warheads, said his thinking has evolved on such defenses because of the rapid advance of technology. He said Mr. Bush knows that current technology cannot produce an impermeable nuclear shield any time soon. But, he added, ''it's not too much to say there is a reasonable prospect to interpose a thin layer of defense.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What's more, Mr. Bush is discussing the possibility of making such reductions unilaterally, rather than through years of negotiations with Russia or China over accuracy, throw-weights, basing modes, build-downs and other esoterica.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said he envisions a sweeping review of strategic needs by the Pentagon that will help establish the optimal size of the nuclear force. He will then challenge Russia to match American reductions in weaponry. His chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, calls these ''reciprocal unilateral measures'' and describes them as a simpler and less time-consuming way to do arms control than the interminable talks that have dominated arms control efforts with Moscow.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As another Bush adviser put it: ''The governor said he was going to figure out what we need, reduce to that level, and encourage the Russians to do the same. We're not going to build stuff we don't need just because Russians have stuff they don't need.''
 </textdata>

  Vice President Al Gore had hoped that such questions would not become central to the presidential campaign this year. He and other administration officials felt they had neutralized much of the Republican fervor for a robust missile shield by moving toward a decision this year on a limited system of land-based national missile defense.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Governor Bush portrayed the administration's approach as timid. He proposed a broader missile shield to appeal to conservatives and deeper weapons cuts than the administration has been willing to entertain.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and his advisers argued this week that United States policy has not kept pace with any of these developments.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''While deterrence remains the first line of defense against nuclear attack, the standoff of the cold war was born of a different time,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech Tuesday at the National Press Club. ''Yet almost a decade after the end of the cold war, our nuclear policy still resides in that already distant past.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both countries argue that the old system of deterrence that Mr. Bush derides as outdated is still the most reliable method of keeping the nuclear peace. Chinese officials have said they might have to accelerate their own nuclear program if the Americans build an antimissile shield.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore quickly issued a statement rejecting Mr. Bush's ideas as risky and irresponsible. He said Mr. Bush wanted to resurrect the discredited Star Wars program of the Reagan era and flaunt American military superiority over Russia, China and every other nation. And he chastised Governor Bush for opposing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which was defeated in the Senate last fall on a largely party-line vote.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's response drew a rebuke from Mr. Bush's advisers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to President George Bush and a retired Air Force general, said construction of missile defenses should not be seen as a threat to the nuclear forces of Russia and China nor as an incentive for them to beef up their arsenals.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a statement today, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, praised Mr. Bush's ideas -- up to a point. He applauded his intention to undertake a thorough review of America's nuclear posture and endorsed his plan to take weapons off high-alert status. He agreed that the size of the nuclear arsenal could safely be reduced.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Biden also said that Mr. Bush held an unrealistic view of the feasibility and cost of missile defenses and that a radical revision of decades of deterrence unnerve allies and adversaries alike.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The senator urged Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to remove the question from the political debate and to allow the next president to study the matter outside of the electoral arena.

  BUSH DAUGHTERS' DAY -- ''I'll have a tear in my eye,'' Gov. George W. Bush said yesterday in Austin, Tex., as he prepared to watch his twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, graduate from Stephen F. Austin High School and head off for college. ''They mean more to us than anything in life,'' he went on. ''Today is a big day.'' Then, making clear that he wanted to continue the family's  effort to shield the teenagers as much as possible from the spotlight of public life, he told reporters, ''You all aren't invited, by the way.''

  The trade bill could be Mr. Clinton's last tough legislative battle as president. His commendable willingness to stand up to labor and most members of his own party on trade belies his reputation as subservient to his party's core constituencies. On the other side of the aisle, Gov. George W. Bush has shown leadership in repudiating the isolationists in his own party. Organized labor's decision to turn this into a make-or-break test of loyalty for its supporters has been shortsighted and destructive.

  Abraham Lincoln, Adlai Stevenson, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole. What did each have that today's presidential candidates lack in such great abundance? A sense of humor, springing from the gut, not a 3-by-5-inch ghost-written card [''Fear and Joking on the Late-Night Campaign Trail'' by Peter Marks, May 7]. Neither Al Gore nor George W. Bush has the instincts it takes to go joke for joke with a killer comic. Indeed, it sometimes seems that both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have decided that maybe Calvin Coolidge had the right idea: ''I think the American public wants a solemn ass as a President. And I think I'll go along with them.'' Each would profit from the advice of Richard M. Nixon, who, of all people, said, ''The worst sin in politics is being boring.'' And, when elected, the winner should keep in mind this warning from Mr. Dole: ''What people often forget is that the last laugh doesn't belong to the victorious candidate -- it belongs to the late-night comics.''

  MacArthur, the president and publisher of Harper's Magazine, is at his best describing the lobbying that occurred after the treaty was signed and went to Congress in August 1993. He shows how business lobbyists worked hand in glove with the treaty's Congressional supporters. But he has surprisingly little to say about the negotiations themselves, or about the domestic political conflicts that occurred while the treaty was being negotiated. His account of these tends to render shades of gray as black. When the Bush administration proposed that Congress agree to a fast-track vote (up or down without amendments), Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader and a Democrat, backed Bush on the condition that the treaty contain rules on labor standards and environmental protection. MacArthur dismisses this position as nave and opportunistic. (Gephardt ''was presumably ambitious to be liked by the sort of people, honest or not, who can make you president.'')

  A year later, during the presidential campaign, Bill Clinton, under the influence of Gephardt and two advisers, Derek Shearer and Richard Rothstein, adopted the same position. MacArthur treats Clinton even more contemptuously than he does Gephardt. He says Clinton ''had already made up his mind on trade to the point where there was no substantial difference between his position and Bush's.'' Clinton's stand, he says, was primarily based on fund-raising. That assertion leaves little middle ground between those adamantly opposed to Nafta and those enthusiastically in favor. MacArthur may be right, but when I covered the negotiations I found otherwise.

  Others on the right hold more confused views. George W. Bush supports a constitutional amendment to ban abortion in most cases, and yet as governor of Texas he has personally signed the death warrants of more than 120 people -- about a sixth of all the condemned prisoners executed since capital punishment was revived in the 1970's. In an interview with Talk magazine last year, he even made fun of one of the victims of Texas' death row, Karla Fay Tucker, mocking her pleas for mercy. And despite growing DNA evidence of the innocence of many death-row convicts across the country, Bush has shown not even a glimmer of concern that the Texas judicial system might be flawed. Or take the vociferously anti-abortion representative Henry Hyde. Two years ago, Hyde said: ''I look for the common thread in slavery, the Holocaust and abortion. To me, the common thread is dehumanizing people.'' And yet Hyde has personally championed legislation that significantly curtails the judicial review of death-row appeals. Even Alan Keyes, that peerless defender of unborn life, turns out to be a supporter of criminals' deaths. He said earlier this year, ''I think that there are circumstances under which it is essential . . . that we have and apply the death penalty in order to send a clear moral message to people throughout our society that we will not tolerate that kind of disrespect for life.'' In other words, if you want to support life, enforce death.

  In a rousing speech to an A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in New Jersey, Vice President Gore used the attack word secret seven times. It is now his favorite adjective, having temporarily replaced risky (as in the phrase, pronounced as one word, riskytaxscheme).

  He was blazing away at Governor Bush's proposal, not yet detailed, to allow individuals to divert a portion of their Social Security taxes into the stock market. Gore charged that Bush believed ''it would be best not to let you, the voters of this country, in on the secret plan before the election. . . . He is suppressing the details of how his plan would work and refusing to divulge what his secret plan really is.'' At a subsequent news conference, he evidently felt that secret was not pejorative enough and added, redundantly, a ''private secret plan.''

  Even Gore, a few weeks before he leveled the tried-and-true phrase at Bush, showed he was aware of its old-chestnuttiness. In a hilarious, deadpan, self-mocking speech to the Gridiron Club in Washington, he was widely reported to have said he had a secret plan to win the White House: he would claim credit for all the good stuff that had happened in the past eight years and dissociate himself from the bad stuff.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000

 <textdata>
  Meanwhile, George W. Bush has been using an attack word of his own to characterize the Gore approach to Social Security: ''For eight years,'' he wrote in a fund-raising letter, ''Clinton/Gore has had history's greatest opportunity to reform Social Security. They chose to demagogue the problem, not repair it.''
 </textdata>

  I kept this letter, sent to me by its recipient, Leila Hadley Luce of New York, to note the use of the beslashed singular subject Clinton/Gore, followed properly by the singular verb has, but then followed incorrectly by they. Clinton/Gore is a team and takes an it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000

 <textdata>
  Governor Bush cannot be faulted for using demagogue as a verb. It was coined in that form by James Harrington in his 1656 utopian theory, ''Commonwealth of Oceana.'' He picked up the noun coined five years earlier by Thomas Hobbes and wrote of a time ''when that same ranting fellow Alcibiades fell a demagoging for the Sicilian war.'' In 1890, The Cincinnati Commercial Gazette wrote of President Benjamin Harrison, ''The president never thought of demagoging the matter.''

  Will Gore now assail Bush for harboring a secret plan to attack him for demagoguery? Will Bush lash back in a debate by demanding he spell it? Both sides are now armed.

  As of last week, 3,775 home-grown Web sites had the Bush name in them and 3,066 had Mr. Gore's name, compared with virtually none containing candidates' names in the last presidential campaign. Not all, of course, support one of the two candidates.  Some praise, some mock, some parody and others simply repeat much of what the two candidates have said or post news articles about them from other sources.
 </textdata>

  So far, the Bush campaign seems to have suffered the greatest sting from parody sites, particularly over questions about whether he used drugs. The Bush campaign, in fact, tried to restrict one scathing Web site, www.gwbush.com, arguing that the site should be regulated as a political committee, but the campaign's complaint was dismissed last month by the Federal Election Commission.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000

 <textdata>
  And as Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore know well, it also provides an opportunity for critics to exploit their foibles. For instance, www.all gore.com, recently featured a parody of Mr. Gore saying, ''Elian can live with me.'' And anti-Bush Web sites  like www.georgybush.com feature parody songs in Spanish and English that can be put on CD's for distribution.

  None of the speakers mentioned the name of Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But N.R.A. officials said that it was likely the group would endorse Mr. Bush after the Republican National Convention this summer and throw its substantial resources behind him  -- provided he does not try to distance himself too much from the group.

  Mr. Bush has been an ally of the N.R.A. in Texas, signing bills to allow residents to carry concealed weapons and prohibiting municipalities from filing lawsuits against gun makers. But the governor has distanced himself somewhat from the group, needing to court centrist voters. Despite that, N.R.A. officials said today that they still view Mr. Bush as a friend.

  ''I haven't seen anything George W. Bush has said about this organization or issue that I disagree with,'' James J. Baker, the N.R.A.'s chief lobbyist in Washington, said in an interview.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even as they avoided invoking Mr. Bush's name, today's speakers repeatedly inched closer to urging N.R.A. members to vote for him, if only to defeat Mr. Gore.

  ''Vice President Al Gore is the type of politician where nothing is sacred, that will say and do anything to preserve their own political future, even if that means using fear and deceptive means,'' Mr. Watts was to say, according to an advance text of his speech. ''His party used to say, 'There's nothing to fear but fear itself.' Now the vice president has nothing to offer but fear itself.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For all the recriminations between Mr. Gore and the N.R.A., the fight in many ways benefits both sides by energizing supporters. Mr. Baker acknowledged today that attacking Mr. Gore and President Clinton has helped the group's membership drives.

  ''When people feel threatened, they tend to join and contribute,'' he said. He added that if Mr. Bush is elected and the Republicans retain control of Congress, ''we probably would lose members.''

  Even as they claimed responsibility for repeatedly knocking down gun-control legislation in Washington, N.R.A. officials told their members that the Clinton-Gore administration had spent the last seven years assaulting their right to bear arms. And the officials warned, often with an urgency that even some N.R.A. members found hyperbolic, that Mr. Gore would take immediate steps toward confiscating their weapons once elected.

  ''For the next six months, Al Gore is going to smear you as the enemy,'' Mr. Baker told N.R.A. members. ''He will slander you as gun-toting, knuckle-dragging, bloodthirsty maniacs who stand in the way of a safer America. Will you remain silent?''

  And, as Mr. Simon points out, there was Fred Coe, the producer -- legendary within the television industry -- who nurtured writing talents like Paddy Chayefsky, Horton Foote and Gore Vidal. The teleplays they created were largely, he says, about ''contemporary life in the 50's.''  ''Marty,'' for instance, the 1953 television play written by Chayefsky, was not just about an unmarried young butcher with a possessive mother and no ideas for what to do on Saturday night, but about the transition from ''tradition to modern values,'' from prewar to postwar thinking. ''Fail Safe'' -- which starred Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Dennehy, Harvey Keitel and Noah Wyle -- was based on a 1964 movie and dealt with the cold war anxieties of the early 60's.

  Many of the roots of Mr. Bush's political philosophy as a presidential candidate -- including his belief in tough love for juvenile offenders -- seem to go back to his childhood. Midland, a conservative, up-from-the-bootstraps town that has grown from 25,000 when he was a little boy to almost 100,000 today, mirrors Mr. Bush's optimism, his faith in business and his doubts about an activist  government. While playing Little League baseball, running for class president, or even sobbing in the principal's office, George W. Bush absorbed West Texas values that many old friends say are central to understanding who he is today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush himself, in a long interview about his roots, made a similar point. ''I don't know what percentage of me is Midland,'' he said, ''but I would say people, if they want to understand me, need to understand Midland and the attitude of Midland.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is in the soil of Midland that Mr. Bush has said he would like to be buried when he dies, and it was to Midland that he returned in the 1970's to marry and start a family. It gave him an anchor in real America.

  Mr. Bush has often said that ''the biggest difference between me and my father is that he went to Greenwich Country Day and I went to San Jacinto Junior High.'' That may be an exaggeration of the younger Mr. Bush's populist credentials, because he is also a product of Andover, Yale and Harvard. But there is still something to it.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The father, chauffeured to and from private school in Connecticut in a black sedan,  suffered politically because of the perception that he was a blue blood who could not relate to ordinary people. The younger Mr. Bush also has been tainted by the idea that he was born into privilege with a visa to effortless wealth and prominence. Yet George W. Bush actually had a rather ordinary childhood, and his years biking around small-town streets in jeans and a white T-shirt left him with a common touch that is among his greatest assets as a politician.

  ''He understands Bubba because there is more Bubba in him,'' Karl Rove, the longtime political adviser to the Bushes, told a reporter in 1992, when Mr. Bush's friends were still carefree enough to say colorful things about him. ''He is clearly the wild son -- even today. Part of it is rooted in Midland, where he grew up in an ordinary neighborhood, where houses are close together and risk was a way of life.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000

 <textdata>
  Midland, impatient with ideas and introspection, was a world of clear rights and wrongs, long on absolutes and devoid of ethical gray shades. It may be the source of some of Mr. Bush's greatest political strengths, the unpretentiousness and mellow bonhomie that warm up voters, and also of his weaknesses, including an image of an intellectual lightweight that is underscored whenever he mixes up the likes of Slovenia and Slovakia.
 </textdata>

  The oil made Midland a boomtown, attracting ambitious businessmen like the elder Mr. Bush and many other out-of-staters as well. These people made for a conservative town but not a redneck one; Midland had a large proportion of geologists, engineers, lawyers and accountants, and Ivy League college graduates were everywhere.

  Mr. Bush recalls it in Norman Rockwell pastels, and so do many other residents. Children bicycled everywhere on their own, crime was almost nonexistent and if anyone suspicious -- say, someone with a beard --  showed up in town, then-Sheriff Ed Darnell (known as Big Ed) would stop him, escort him to the edge of town, and tell him to ''get out.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Yet what no one volunteers is that it was also rigidly segregated in those days, like most places in the South. Black children went to their own school rather than to Sam Houston Elementary with George Bush. The bus station and train station had separate waiting rooms for blacks and whites, and there were separate, dilapidated drinking fountains marked ''colored'' at the stations and at the courthouse.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The Bushes' first encounter with West Texas racism came when they casually invited a black man, working for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to come by their temporary home in neighboring Odessa. The man had the tact to stay away, but neighbors heard about this and warned the elder George Bush to stop these invitations unless he wanted to be tarred and feathered.

  Michael Proctor, who lived across the street and was playing with George at the time, remembers watching as Mrs. Bush grabbed her son by the ear and dragged him into the bathroom. She washed his mouth out with soap as he spluttered indignantly.
 </textdata>

  5-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Alongside the racism directed at blacks, there was a measured respect for the Mexicans who came over the border to work in the oil fields. As a boomtown, Midland needed laborers and welcomed Mexican immigrants, who were regarded as hard-working and thrifty. Some old friends find an echo of that attitude in Mr. Bush's efforts to push the Republican Party to reach out to immigrants.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  ''We saw these people cross the border and just wanting a good job,'' recalls Randall Roden, a neighbor boy and best friend. Mr. Roden recalls going out with George and his father to an oil well and spending the night sleeping in the back of the Bushes' station wagon as the crew -- Mexicans among them -- struggled to get the well going.

  George W. Bush, though born in 1946 in New Haven, Conn., while his father was still an over-achieving student at Yale, moved to West Texas when he was not quite 2 and grew up in this nurturing environment. These days, as the son of a president and scion of a wealthy family, he is often perceived as a child of privilege, but neighbors in those days insist that in the 1950's that was not the case.

  The Bush family in the Northeast had money, but the elder George left all that behind to make his own fortune in West Texas. Equipped with connections but initially without seed money, George and Barbara Bush and little George, their firstborn, settled in a tiny apartment in the hard-driving oil town of Odessa, where they shared a bathroom with a mother-daughter team of prostitutes living next door.
 </textdata>

  Local people say that you raise hell in Odessa but raise a family in nearby Midland, a much more respectable place. So, after a one-year interlude in California, the Bushes moved to Midland, living in a bright blue 847-square-foot bungalow on a newly built street in which every home was identical -- but painted bright colors to make them seem different. It was called Easter Egg Row, because the houses looked like colored eggs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The family prospered in the oil business and moved into a series of nicer houses in Midland, culminating in one with a swimming pool. But this was not as much of a draw as it might have been. Just down the street lived Peggy Porter, one of the cutest girls in school, and because she had a pool as well, it was in much greater demand than the Bush family's.

  Occasionally George W.'s grandfather, Senator Prescott S. Bush of Connecticut, would visit and cause a mild stir of interest in the neighborhood. But for the most part, the Bush family was regarded as fairly typical of the out-of-staters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000

 <textdata>
  These days, Governor Bush is often seen as a princeling, the son of a president, the scion of a famous family, and Al Gore as more of his own man. But in the 1950's and early 1960's, it was the other way around. Back then, the name George Bush belonged only to an obscure Texas businessman. George W.'s closest connection to the White House was that he was a descendant on his mother's side of Franklin Pierce, America's 14th president. In contrast, in those days ''Albert Gore'' was virtually a household name, belonging to a prominent senator (the present candidate's father and namesake) who was sometimes mentioned as presidential or vice-presidential timber. The senator lost his seat in 1970 and faded into obscurity.

  Yet young George was not some country hick, and he also learned to fit into the world of his Connecticut grandparents. The family regularly spent part of the summer at the family retreat in Kennebunkport, Me., and in 1954 the father took George and his best friend, Randall Roden, to Washington to see the White House, the United States Capitol and a baseball game with the Washington Senators (whose later incarnation would move to Texas and become the Rangers, owned in part by George W.

  When they are tracked down, the boys and girls who once played dodgeball at Sam Houston Elementary School, while now scattered around the country, offer recollections that are very similar: Midland was an idyllic place in which to grow up, and George W. Bush was a very typical child. In contrast to other recent presidential candidates, Mr. Bush in childhood is remarkable primarily for his ordinariness.

  ''He wasn't any different from anybody else,'' recalled Robert A. McCleskey, an old playmate. ''You read about Clinton and Gore and how at that age they were planning to be president. Not Bush.''

  No one has ever accused Mr. Bush of being an intellectual, and the indifference to books started early. Childhood friends recall Mr. Bush reading only two sets of books for pleasure -- the Hardy boys and a series of mystery books about baseball. As one asks about his reading habits, there are a few snickers.

  George and Barbara Bush led a drive to build a school library (the school did not previously have one), but books were not a major part of a boy's childhood in Midland. Erstwhile acquaintances, while deeply admiring of the Bushes' goodness and decency, have trouble recalling early signs of greatness in the son.

  Even if he did not distinguish himself as a student, former classmates describe him as smart and blessed with an excellent memory. He had a passion for baseball statistics, a first-rate collection of baseball cards and a reputation as such a shrewd trader that boys were careful not to agree to a trade with George Bush without thinking it over very carefully.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush's lifelong adoration of baseball began when he and other neighborhood boys would go early to school to play ball. Mr. Bizilo, the principal, would take off his jacket, loosen his tie and hit balls for the boys to field.

  In particular, it was in Midland that Mr. Bush first learned to fit in, even if his parents were Yankees and his grandfather a senator. That ability to adapt and bridge groups has never left him.

  Moreover, Midland values were remarkably unshaken by the 1960's. Some Midland alumni say they let their hair grow a bit longer, but -- like George W. Bush -- they mostly stood with the establishment instead of rejecting it. Very few seem to have protested significantly against the Vietnam War, seriously used drugs, thought of police as ''pigs,'' denounced their parents as oppressors or picked up a copy of Das Kapital.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000

 <textdata>
  ''It's a town of embedded values,'' Mr. Bush recalled, adding that it had ''a heavy dose of individualism and fairly healthy disrespect for government.'' Asked if his own skepticism about the role for government is a product of Midland attitudes, Mr. Bush paused and finally nodded, saying: ''I think there's a parallel there, I do.''
 </textdata>

  Midland was steeped in optimism, and for many people growing up here in the 1950's, the moral of childhood was that the system worked, that anyone who struggled enough in that baking desert had a good chance of finding oil and striking it rich. The trajectory of the Bush family itself, from the apartment with the shared bathroom to the sprawling house and pool, underscored the point.

  ''The lesson lasted with George W. for years,'' said Bill Minutaglio, a Texan who has written a biography of Mr. Bush. ''I think he truly believes that people can win the lottery if they work hard, that if they put their nose to the grindstone it'll all work out without government help or intrusion.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000

 <textdata>
  When Mr. Bush talks about ''compassionate conservatism'' or ''faith-based initiatives,'' he evokes what old classmates remember as the spirit of Midland of the 1950's. Asked if that is what he has in mind, Mr. Bush interrupts half-way through the question. ''Yeah, absolutely,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Those who know Midland are convinced that Mr. Bush is sincere when he preaches compassion and calls for a ''responsibility era.'' But some also admit that it is fair to question the relevance of lessons from a town where raw capitalism made so many people rich and where community spirit wove such a strong safety net.

  But his eyes were playing tricks on him. His parents had come to break the news to him that Robin had just died of leukemia. The loss staggered the Bush family, and some friends say that George's closeness to his mother dates partly from his efforts to comfort her at that time.

  Mr. Bush's political debut appears to have come in the seventh grade, although both he and his wife, Laura, (who was in the same seventh grade but barely knew him) say they have no recollection of it. Classmates recall that he ran for seventh-grade class president against Jack Hanks.

  Mr. Wood, as bright and ambitious as he was athletic, beat out George Bush on the football field and was the first-string quarterback on the seventh-grade team (Mr. Bush was the second-string quarterback). Mr. Wood eventually became the junior high school and high school student council president and even headed the statewide association of student councils. If any young man in Midland seemed destined for the White House, classmates remember, it was he.

  Pigeon keeping has been in decline since the end of World War II, when high-rises  began to replace tenements and eliminate the essential components of the game: flat rooftops and a concentration of pigeon keepers. But one would not know that from the heavy weekday traffic at the store.

  To this justice, and to interest groups on the left and the right, the 2000 presidential campaign is not so much about whether Al Gore or George W. Bush makes it to the White House. It's about whom Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush would put on the Supreme Court, where vacancies are  likely, if not in the next four years, then certainly in the next president's potential second term. Three of the nine justices are age 70 or older.

  In just about every speech, Mr. Gore warns that religious conservatives like Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell would ratify prospects for the bench in a Bush administration. His advisers were emboldened last week when the court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, overturned parts of the Violence Against Women Act, in a rebuke to Congress's efforts to use interstate commerce rules to preempt state powers. That ruling, they said, would galvanize women who feel they have been left more vulnerable to gender-motivated violence.

  ''If Bush or Gore says, 'Vote for me because in 2015 Medicare or Social Security will be in better shape,' I don't think that's going to motivate a lot of voters because of the lack of immediacy,'' said Stuart M.

  RECOGNIZING that the court carries little political weight with most voters -- and perhaps that his views could put off the moderates he will need in November -- Mr. Bush never raises the subject. When asked, he reassures conservatives by suggesting that his nominees would be ''strict constructionists,'' uncomfortable with Roe v. Wade, though he has insisted he would not administer a litmus test to make sure his running mate shares his anti-abortion position.

  The hope among Democrats is that they might turn the court into an issue that goes beyond their party base, and draws away moderates who are intrigued by Mr. Bush. There is a possibility for the court to be more at the fore in this campaign because in the next several weeks it is expected to hand down decisions on a series of controversial issues: federalism, partial birth abortion, gays in the Boy Scouts and a challenge to the Miranda warning, which requires police to advise suspects of their rights before beginning an interrogation.

  The issue under discussion by the presumptive Republican and Democratic nominees for president was a vital one, if not exactly the sort that stops voters' hearts: how to protect the Social Security system, which both candidates say is slowly going broke. Speaking in Southern California, Mr. Bush announced a plan for reforming the federal retirement-benefits system that would allow workers to invest some of their payroll taxes in private accounts.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore argued that Mr. Bush's plan misplaces its trust by exposing workers' retirement money to the mercy of the markets and making it impossible for the government to pay down the national debt. ''Tens of millions of investors who have not gone through the Fordham Business School,'' Mr. Gore said, ''would be placed in a situation where a lot of financial shenanigans could take place.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-21-2000

  The vice president also revealed a protective streak with his own investments. After Mr. Bush told reporters that Mr. Gore had a lot of money in stocks, Mr. Gore replied that he had not invested in the markets in 25 years for fear of an appearance of a conflict.
 </textdata>

  The back-and-forth over money matters came as a New York Times/CBS News poll showed that most voters are thinking less about candidates' detailed fiscal calculations than about how nice they seem. Mr. Bush was favored over Mr. Gore in the new poll by 47 percent to 39 percent, and although more respondents liked Mr. Gore's stands on the issues, they liked Mr. Bush even more as a person.

  Although the spotlight has shifted to Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton, prominent Democrats portray Mr. Clinton's role as that of an enormously valuable Strategist in Chief. They describe him as a sponge for absorbing political statistics -- a skill that is all the more enhanced because he has run twice in all 435 Congressional districts. And he willingly brings his well-honed political instincts to bear while exerting the power of the presidency to elect Democrats.

  Mr. Clinton has been seeking election or re-election since 1974, when he was defeated in a race for Congress. And the president's closest advisers say that although he is no longer running himself, his passion for electoral politics has never receded. They also cite another, more personal, reason for Mr. Clinton's deep involvement: he wants to burnish his own legacy with the election of Mr. Gore to succeed him, the installation of Mrs. Clinton as senator from New York and the return of the House to Democratic control.

  Others who have talked politics with Mr. Clinton said he was preoccupied with the need for Democrats to win the loyalty of Hispanic voters. They said he had even spoken in detail about the importance of married Protestants. And, they said, he was particularly intrigued by contests in Michigan, New Jersey and Florida, where Mr. Gore has been pressing his campaign amid the tumult over the administration's handling of the Elian Gonzalez case.

  Mr. Clinton still convenes political meetings twice a month or so in the ornate Yellow Oval Room in the White House family quarters. The sessions are not as pressing as they were when they were held weekly before the 1996 campaign, and the group of participants, which often numbers close to two dozen, is usually larger than the more exclusive club of the past. Mr. Gore does not attend anymore.

  James Carville, an architect of Mr. Clinton's victory in 1992, said of the president: ''If he calls me it would be to chat about Gore and Hillary. But I've had him tell me ideas for brochures in Senate races. He's a rare combination of somebody who's got the brains and the gut.''

  Self-deprecation was also the centerpiece of Vice President Gore's successful monologues at the Gridiron dinner, in 1994, 1997 and last March. At the 1994 dinner, Mr. Gore made fun of his reputation for stiffness by being wheeled into the dais on a handcart. This year, he told the assembled journalists that ''there are some things I won't do to become president. I won't hold a press conference.'' He also drew roars by asking plaintively: ''This isn't a fund-raiser, is it?''

His appearance on the Letterman show in March, however, drew chilly reviews.

  Back in the Bush era, when Americans feared that the Japanese might take over, Rapaille was summoned by a corporate sponsor to find out how the United States could adapt Asian high-efficiency management concepts, like ''do it right the first time.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-7-2000

 <textdata>
  ''Bill Clinton fascinates me,'' he said. ''Americans loved him. Why? Because Clinton made mistakes. It means he was learning something and getting better.'' Rapaille said that in the late 80's, Lee Atwater, then working for George Bush p re, hired him to do an archetype study of the presidency. Though financing ran out before Rapaille could complete his work, he was able to gather useful material in the word-association sessions. Participants compared the chief executive to a ''movie character''; they said he could ''make people see things.'' From this, Rapaille was able to identify the core emotional nubbin. Fatherhood? Celebration? Nationalism? No, no. The presidency is: ''cheap entertainment.''
 </textdata>

  ''Gore is boring,'' Rapaille said. ''This is a real problem. Bush is not very intelligent. But then, who cares? Americans have never been impressed by intellectuals.'' So Bush's mediocre mind is not nearly the handicap that Gore's leaden personality is. Rapaille gives Bush the edge, but neither one of them interests him much. He openly pines for Bill Clinton the icon (not the politician). Mistakes weren't Clinton's only asset. America's code, according to Rapaille, is built around ''hope.'' That's why Clinton's slogan in 1992 ''was simply brilliant,'' Rapaille said. ''I still believe in a place called ''hope.''' He's almost a genius.'' Clinton had instinctively hit the grand slam of presidential codes. Mistakes. Cheap Entertainment. Hope.

  Saturday's telecast of the Kentucky Derby marked the end of a long run for ABC, which had been the Triple Crown network for many years. Next year the Derby will move to NBC as part of a five-year Triple Crown package. Race officials hope the switch will provide more promotion and exposure for the Derby, which has had declining ratings. The Derby, however, falls in the middle of the National Basketball Association playoffs, which NBC also televises. Churchill Downs officials realize their telecast may be sandwiched between N.B.A. games -- for better or worse. . . . A former president and a presidential candidate were Derby guests of WILLIAM FARISH, the Churchill Downs president. Former President GEORGE BUSH and his son Gov. GEORGE W. BUSH of Texas joined Farish, a friend of the Bushes. The former president had been to the Derby before; his son made his first visit.

  The ''it'' was, perhaps, the most uncomfortable moment of political humor of the television season. After weeks of goading by Mr. Letterman, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas agreed to appear by satellite on his show, an encounter that was, by most assessments, a disaster for the Republican presidential candidate. Mr. Bush, hampered by the split-second time delay and projecting an air of being led on a forced march, offered one lame quip after another, including a pun about Mr. Letterman's recent heart operation so strained that it left the host staring, mortified, into the camera.

  Having a serious impact on real events is, of course, the last thing on the minds of most of the writers and performers of political satire on television. ''I just want the politicians and the people who watch our show to know that this is a place where the buck honestly stops,'' said Bill Maher, the no-nonsense host of ''Politically Incorrect,'' ABC's freewheeling after-hours talkfest. Still, as the Bush appearance on ''Letterman'' illustrates, political comedy relies ever more intensively on the willing (and in some instances unwitting) participation of actual officeholders and officeseekers.

  He is aware, though, that his blunt style has power. Asked, for instance, if he had invited Mr. Bush on his show, Mr. Maher laughed at the improbability of such an appearance. ''I've been so hard on him,'' he said. (He added that he was not a fan of Vice President Al Gore, either.)

For weeks, he complained on the air about Hillary Rodham Clinton's refusal to appear on the show after announcing her campaign for the Senate seat from New York.

  In a series of brisk exchanges last week, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush laid out their disagreements over gun control, foreign policy, tax cuts, Social Security and Mr. Bush's record in Texas. Perhaps because he is struggling to stay even with Mr. Bush in the polls, Mr. Gore was on the attack almost every day, using highly personal language to derogate his opponent's policies. The subtext, however, was not about policy. It was about experience and temperament. Mr. Gore, with his customary lack of subtlety, was suggesting that Mr. Bush is an untested leader with half-baked ideas.  Stressing the value of experience is a time-honored strategy for the more seasoned candidate in presidential contests. But it comes with no guarantee of success.

  Jimmy Carter has been on both sides of the experience strategy. He won as a new face in 1976, but when he tried in 1980 to depict the Republican challenger, Ronald Reagan, as unready for the White House, the tactic backfired. Mr. Reagan was a deft campaigner and debater who skillfully parried Mr. Carter's attempt to make him appear a lightweight. That bit of history bears a cautionary message for Mr. Gore. Even though the vice president is the best debater in presidential politics today, Mr. Bush could gain significantly with a better-than-expected performance. For now, he is arguing that the vice president's extreme attacks distort his record and insult the voters.

  In a series of brisk exchanges last week, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush laid out their disagreements over gun control, foreign policy, tax cuts, Social Security and Mr. Bush's record in Texas. Perhaps because he is struggling to stay even with Mr. Bush in the polls, Mr. Gore was on the attack almost every day, using highly personal language to derogate his opponent's policies. The subtext, however, was not about policy. It was about experience and temperament. Mr. Gore, with his customary lack of subtlety, was suggesting that Mr. Bush is an untested leader with half-baked ideas.  Stressing the value of experience is a time-honored strategy for the more seasoned candidate in presidential contests. But it comes with no guarantee of success. Otherwise we would never have had presidents named Carter, Reagan and Clinton.

  Down the road, however, he will have to engage Mr. Gore's points more directly. The vice president is right to raise questions about Mr. Bush's achievement in education, the environment, health care and budget issues. He may have exaggerated Mr. Bush's lack of budget experience, but his point that Texas has a weak-governor system is a valid one.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On foreign policy, Mr. Gore is also raising some fair questions about Mr. Bush, though there is a fine line between the license granted politicians who speak in generalities and outright distortion. The vice president accuses the governor of having a cold-war ''mindset'' that treats China and Russia as ''enemies.'' Mr. Bush says he has gone out of his way to assert the contrary. But Mr. Bush would withdraw loans and credits to Russia over its crackdown in Chechnya and abrogate the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. These two steps would be dangerously confrontational.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even so, Mr. Gore goes too far in accusing Mr. Bush of being an isolationist. As his father's son, he would be heir to policies -- and advisers -- that are international in outlook. As for China's status as a trade partner, Mr. Bush's position is the same as that of the Clinton administration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The arena where Mr. Gore has used his toughest language, surprisingly, is the budget. He repeatedly labels as perilous both the governor's $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan and his proposal to carve private investment accounts out of the Social Security system. In fact, Mr. Gore's reliance on the word ''risky'' for almost every Bush proposal probably should inspire someone to send the vice president a thesaurus. His point, however, is right. The tax cut, which Mr. Gore says would actually cost more than $2 trillion if you included the extra interest expenses from not paying down the debt, is ill-advised. And Mr. Bush has not addressed warnings from such stellar Republicans as Alan Greenspan that a big tax cut now could hurt the economy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is of course an exaggeration for Mr. Gore to say that Mr. Bush has a ''secret plan'' for Social Security. There is something to be said for Mr. Bush's not getting lost in details, as former Senator Bill Bradley did earlier this year on the health issue. But the governor needs to flesh out his ideas on Social Security privatization. He must also explain how he would pay for his tax cut and at the same time increase military and education spending without jeopardizing other vital programs.

  There is a risk that the public could be turned off by bitter exchanges over policy minutiae and budget numbers. But such debates take the measure of the candidates. For Mr. Gore they reveal a policy aficionado who also has a gladiatorial instinct for verbal combat. For Mr. Bush they reveal someone who prefers to be aloof from detail, but who may not be able to pull that off with the ease of a Ronald Reagan. As the debate over experience continues, the candidates will be eyeing the polls for a reading on what the voters make of Mr. Bush's desire to float above the fray or Mr. Gore's desire to plunge into it.

  Mr. Gore's hammering away was a leading indicator of a new, more aggressive phase of the campaign. The retreat of Elian Gonzalez with his father to a Maryland estate seems to have opened up space again on America's front page for campaign machinations, much of them testier. In California, a conservative group, Shape the Debate, has begun running anti-Gore commercials; last week, Handgun Control introduced a spot that said Mr. Bush had signed a law that allows concealed guns in churches and amusement parks.

  The ammunition for Mr. Gore's attack was provided on Wednesday, when it was disclosed that the nation's gun companies had broken off settlement talks with 31 municipalities across the nation over lawsuits relating to gun violence, in hopes Mr. Bush would win the presidency and usher in a more favorable environment. (In other signs of the changing environment, a panel of Republicans proposed altering the current primary system, to allow only smaller states to vote first.)

  Half a century later, the highways he built can barely handle a 5 p.m. crush of commuters in their S.U.V.'s, much less a panicky evacuation of the capital. But if he were alive today, the old five-star might smile to hear the latest Clinton White House strategy. The president and his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, have taken up a mantra that granting permanent ''normal'' trading status to China isn't just about profit opportunities, it's also about national security. At the same time, the administration has labeled the AIDS crisis in Africa a threat to national security, and Vice President Al Gore has raised similar fears with his ''new security agenda,'' which includes global warming.

  Advisers to Mr. Bush, eager to portray the current occupants of the White House as long on butter and short on guns, carry the argument one step further: by making the list of security threats too long, they argue, the Clinton administration risks taking its eye off more imminent threats. Or as Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the school of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and one of those advisers, wrote recently, AIDS in Africa and the environment are serious problems, but calling them  national security threats carries ''the implication that conventional security is no longer something we need to worry much about.''

  On the campaign trail, the two presumptive presidential candidates have differing views of the ''humanitarian intervention'' policy. George W.

Mr. Gore was instrumental in preventing the agency from being melded into the State Department years ago.

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, faces only token Democratic opposition in her re-election campaign this year, which is more opposition than the party is providing in most statewide races.

  Other than the most partisan Republicans, few people in Texas would argue that Democrats are powerless or obsolete, particularly since the party still controls the Congressional delegation and the Texas House of Representatives. But as Mr. Bush campaigns for the White House, Democrats are consumed by a parochial, less glamorous electoral agenda, including legislative races and preparing for the 2002 run for governor. And few elected Democrats are willing to make trouble for the popular Mr. Bush.

Other conservative Democrats in the Legislature either like Mr. Bush personally or are wary of antagonizing him as their districts become increasingly Republican.

  That detente is a timely gift for Mr. Bush as he positions himself as a coalition builder who would foster bipartisanship in Washington. By contrast, Arkansas Republicans tried to crush Bill Clinton in 1992, maligning his record and his character and leaving little doubt of their goal. ''Defeating the enemy at all costs,'' recalled Richard Bearden, then the executive director of the Arkansas Republican Party, ''and Bill Clinton was the enemy.''

  Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University, said testimonials from home-state allies whom many voters across the country might find unexpected could provide credibility for presidential candidates introducing themselves to a national audience. Coming out of Georgia in 1976, Jimmy Carter enlisted the civil rights leader Andrew Young to help demonstrate that he was a Southern Democrat of a sort different from the race-baiting George C. Wallace.  In the same vein, Mr. Black said, Mr. Bush is enlisting Texas Democrats to help reassure voters that he is different from the combative Congressional Republicans of the 1990's.

  Though the decline of the Texas Democrats has roots in the 1960's, the unequivocal slap in the face from the voters came in 1998, when the party lost every one of more than a dozen statewide races, from governor to lieutenant governor to land commissioner, and Mr. Bush won  with nearly 70 percent of the vote.

  An autopsy of recent Democratic misfortunes would point to money and demographics as the chief problems. Texas' huge size requires statewide candidates to raise millions upon millions of dollars in order to compete in every media market. With corporate interests favoring Republicans, said Mr. Kronberg, the online analyst, Democrats often depend on contributions from trial lawyers. And Republicans, led by Mr. Bush, have demonized the trial bar as greedy pushers of unnecessary lawsuits.

  To a large extent, the immediate future of Texas politics depends on Mr. Bush's future. If he wins in November, his job will fall to Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican whose replacement would be chosen by the State Senate. As the presiding officer of the Senate, the lieutenant governor is considered the official with greatest influence over legislation, and a handful of candidates in both parties are already jockeying for position.

  But neither party dominates the Senate, and no one expects a party-line vote for lieutenant governor. Instead, victory will require attracting votes from both sides, and the hopefuls are making certain to avoid any partisan warfare.

  Regardless of the outcome in November, Democrats say, they are pointing to 2002 and beyond. The powerful statewide offices of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and comptroller are on the ballot in 2002. Mr. Bush will either be in Washington or leaving office in Austin, and Democratic officials already envision a statewide ticket that would include Mr. Sharp, Mr. Hobby and perhaps the mayors of Dallas, Ron Kirk, and Austin, Kirk Watson.

  Mr. McClung and other Democrats also believe that the state's changing demographics may turn in their favor in this decade. Hispanics are expected to soon become the state's most populous ethnic group, and as yet they usually support Democrats. Mr. Bush has aggressively courted Hispanics, but Democrats believe that their appeal is stronger. In addition, college-age voters are showing renewed interest in the party. All this is the gospel that Democrats are repeating to themselves.

  Nevertheless, we have not seen so much political commitment to better schools since the 1988 campaign, when George Bush and Michael Dukakis each announced he intended to become the ''education president.'' The golden age of pedagogy that everyone expected to flow from this contest somehow failed to arrive. Now Al Gore and George W. Bush trade assault e-mail on the subject every single day. Mr. Bush cannot talk enough about the way he's improved the schools in Texas. He is particularly voluble about having ended social promotion, about how he insisted that no Texas child go from the third grade to the fourth until he or she could read at grade level.

 <textdata>
  In truth, the first kids who will ever be affected by that policy are currently in kindergarten. This is the classic political approach to the setting of standards on any topic. You want to be strict about the required levels of achievement, but loose about the timetable. The ideal due date, in fact, is the year after whoever sets the standards leaves office. If Mr. Bush is lucky, by the time Texas third graders start getting held back, he'll be in Washington preparing for his re-election campaign.

  To be fair to Mr. Bush, Texas is actually making an attempt to set the bar higher without whopping it over the heads of the children who happen to get caught in the transition. This year the teachers started getting additional training, and the students' skills are being tested regularly so those who start to fall behind can get special tutoring. A timetable that actually prepares kids for the standards they're supposed to meet is definitely not silly.

  ACCURACY -- It is true that Mr. Bush has often sided with the National Rifle Association in legislative battles in his more than five years as governor. Over the objections of gun control advocates, he signed legislation allowing people to carry concealed handguns, allowing handguns to be taken into churches and prohibiting local governments from suing gun manufacturers. The N.R.A.'s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, also recently helped raise at least $250,000 at a major Republican Party fund-raiser honoring Mr. Bush. But Mr. Bush has at times tried to distance himself from the organization, by supporting mandatory trigger locks for new handguns and criticizing Mr. LaPierre for asserting that President Clinton had tolerated a certain level of gun violence for political reasons.

  SCORECARD -- By trying to depict Mr. Bush as a pawn of the N.R.A., the advertisement seeks to make him seem like an extremist on gun control issues, because the N.R.A. is widely perceived as intransigently opposed to any restrictions on gun ownership. Also, it suggests that the governor is not his own man, that he is beholden to powerful right-wing interest groups. The advertisement is not being shown widely enough to affect many voters directly, but Handgun Control is clearly hoping that journalists in Washington and Texas will use it to write critical stories about Mr. Bush. The group is also running the spot in several cities with hotly contested Congressional races in which gun control may become an important issue, including Lansing and Columbus.

  In their first meeting since Mr. Bush trounced Mr. McCain in the primaries on March 7, the governor and senator are getting together at Mr. Bush's invitation for private fence-mending, public picture-taking and the expectation in the Bush camp that Mr. McCain would eventually make some kind of endorsement.

  Mr. McCain's performance at the signing of copies of his autobiography showed how much he still enjoyed the attention. At a news conference, the senator dropped hints that he might yet endorse Mr. Bush on Tuesday: when asked if that was a possibility, Mr. McCain said, ''Sure.''

  And as if to keep Mr. Bush in suspense, Mr. McCain was quoted in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this morning as ruling out an endorsement for the time being. He told the paper that he wanted a clearer understanding of the governor's claim to be ''a reformer with results.''

  But first, hurt feelings must be purged. In fact, in discussing the mending of the wounded egos on both sides -- Mr. McCain is still smarting over the governor's attack ads and Mr. Bush is said to remain miffed at the senator's resistance to come in from the cold -- Mr. Graham sounded more like a radio psychiatrist.

  ''Probably the most important thing will be body language and tone,'' said Mr. Halperin said. ''All eyes and camera lenses will be on the question of, does McCain act as if George Bush is his leader, or does he act like the independent maverick, unhappy with the way things have turned out?''

  Of course, the question of whether an endorsement by a member of one's own party is meaningful to anyone but the candidate and the people paid to write and talk about it remains an open one. To Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican whose home state is host to the meeting, the issue may be settled a lot more easily than a lot of people think: ''It's for Governor Bush to say, ''I'd like to have your support.' ''
 </textdata>

  After all, Mr. Specter said, he hasn't made an endorsement, either. ''When McCain and Bush were in it together, I thought it was the better part of valor to stay out of it,'' he explained. Since then, he added, ''Nobody's asked me.''

Bush of Texas to clarify his position on federal legislation that would prohibit lawsuits by local governments against gun manufacturers. Mr. Bush signed such legislation in Texas, and suggested last week that he would do the same in Washington. In a telephone news conference yesterday, Mr. Cuomo, who has tried to negotiate settlements between gun makers and cities that have sued them, called Mr. Bush's remarks vague. He asserted that the gun makers, who have broken off talks in recent months, would return to the table if they knew Mr. Bush opposed such legislation. Bush aides accused Mr. Cuomo of politicizing the issue. ''Instead of spending their time distorting and misrepresenting Governor Bush's priorities, the Clinton-Gore administration ought to spend more time enforcing our existing gun laws,'' said Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.

  ABORTION LOOMS AS PLATFORM ISSUE  Various interests groups, especially those that support abortion rights, plan to have their voices heard when the Republican national convention this summer in Philadelphia assembles a platform for this year's nominee. Over the weekend, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the recently selected chairman of the platform committee, offered them some thoughts. After all the hearings are held and all the testimony is heard, he said, the presidential candidate will have the last word, not the committee. ''I'm certainly going to be listening to all sectors of the party,'' Mr. Thompson told The Philadelphia Inquirer. ''But my ultimate client is George Bush, and what he feels best is what we will do.'' On the matter of abortion, Mr. Thompson said he would abide by Mr. Bush's promises to leave the current plank, which strongly opposes abortion.

  RIFT GROWS AMONG ARIZONA REPUBLICANS  It is no secret among Arizona Republicans that Gov. Jane Dee Hull's endorsement of her fellow governor George W. Bush over her fellow Arizonan Senator John McCain left bad feelings on both sides. It was bad enough that last month Ms. Hull agreed to give up the governor's prerogative of leading the state's delegation to the Republican National Convention -- after all, Mr. McCain easily won the primary, and thus the right to control the state's 30-member delegation. Now comes word that Mr. McCain wants his wife, Cindy, to lead the delegation instead. That has rankled Hull supporters. The issue is to be decided at the state party convention on Saturday.

  Support for the measure grew today. The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, publicly endorsed it. Three former presidents, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, issued a letter coordinated by the White House warning that defeat ''would be read in China as a vote for confrontation and as an argument for hunkering down, instead of continuing to reach out.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also supports the measure, but according to aides has not discussed it with Mr. DeLay. So does Vice President Al Gore, although he gave somewhat mixed signals earlier in the year.

  The latest polls show George W. Bush just a whisker ahead of Al Gore in overall voter approval ratings. But when asked about environmental protection, voters give Mr. Gore a double-digit advantage over Mr. Bush. Mr. Gore has begun to exploit this edge; in a speech last month, for example, he said Mr. Bush was only ''pretending to care'' about the environment.

  But as it turns out, the Texas governor's record is far better than activists allow. Governor Bush has tackled environmental problems creatively, with a new approach that emphasizes cooperation over conflict.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Second, Governor Bush's predecessors paid relatively little attention to air quality. Mr. Bush backed an initiative that made Texas only the third state in the nation to require pollution reductions from older power plants that had been exempted from the standards set for more modern ones. By 2003, the Bush plan aims to cut nitrogen oxide emissions, a component of smog, in half. The program included some voluntary commitments by companies, as well as requirements.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush also expanded the ''clean industries 2000'' program, which was started in 1992 by Gov. Ann Richards. To participate, companies committed to cutting their toxic or hazardous waste in half by this year; in exchange, they may display a special environmental logo. So far, 185 companies have together eliminated more than 43 million tons of hazardous waste and reduced energy consumption by 11.3 million kilowatt hours. Through this and other programs, Texas actually led the nation in reducing toxic releases in 1997, the most recent year for which figures have been reported.

  Another conservation effort has helped farmers and ranchers develop plans for helping wildlife survive on  some 10 million acres. On state lands, Mr. Bush led in the creation of a privately financed endowment, bolstered by state appropriations, to restore and maintain every state park, wildlife area and fish hatchery.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some environmental groups don't like Mr. Bush's approach, which emphasizes incentives and voluntary agreements. But what matters are  results. Are pollutants being reduced? Is habitat being protected? Are old hazardous-waste sites getting cleaned up? On this score, Governor Bush's performance looks surprisingly good.

  Mr. Gore has been tepid in his support so far for the agreement, largely because organized labor, which backs him, opposes it. But speaking up for it serves Mr. Gore's political purposes now by helping to counter the impression, reinforced during the controversy over Elian Gonzalez, that he does not take principled stands and instead panders to those whose support he seeks.

  At the annual meeting of Associated Press publishers and editors yesterday in New York, Mr. Gore did not raise the China issue, but was asked about it in a question-and-answer session. Uncharacteristically, he delved into the reasons he believed the trade bill should pass; normally, when he mentions the issue at all, he gives it fairly short shrift.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-9-2000

 <textdata>
  A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said that former President George Bush, the father of Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, was invited, but ''due to a scheduling conflict, he is not able to attend.'' Governor Bush supports the trade agreement.

  Mr. Gore has tried to win over James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters union, but Mr. Hoffa, who is up for re-election and faces his own internal politics, has recently expressed more interest in the third-party candidacy of Patrick J. Buchanan, who also opposes the treaty.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has said he has called some members of Congress to push them to support the treaty, but has not said how many. Aides say he has made calls from his campaign plane and from his office and that if the vice president did not want to appear in the East Room today, he would not do so, suggesting that he sees some political benefit in standing with President Clinton on an issue that the administration has advanced as important to the economy.

Giuliani; Gov. George E. Pataki; Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations; and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.  There were two former mayors, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins, and -- well, the idea is clear. Draw all the lines of alliance, rivalry, anger and affection among those individuals and the results would be as messy as a child's scribble.

  Among the dignitaries attending the invitation-only funeral were President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who sat beside Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper Gore. Behind the President sat Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the first lady's rival for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was also present. Mrs. Clinton shook hands with Mayor Giuliani during the ''kiss of peace'' that is part of the Catholic Mass. On the other side of the coffin, alongside Cardinal O'Connor's family, sat former President George Bush, who was a friend of the cardinal's. Elsewhere in the audience sat Mr. Bush's son, George W. Bush, with his wife, Laura.

  That, as far as I can make out, is what George W. Bush is actually proposing -- though he has been more than vague about the details. He hasn't specified how much guaranteed benefits would be cut, let alone clearly stated that the percentage cut would have to be a lot larger than the share of contributions workers were freed to invest. (The plan described by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan on this page yesterday would in effect impose cuts on that scale, mainly through reduced cost-of-living adjustments and increased taxes on benefits.)

  What a politician can't honestly say is something like, ''Even if a worker chose only the safest investment in the world, an inflation-adjusted U.S. government bond, he or she would receive twice the rate of return of Social Security'' -- as if that were a meaningful comparison, as if the obligations to today's older Americans didn't have to be met. But that quote isn't made up -- it's what Mr. Bush actually said.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today, Mr. Gore addressed both complaints, saying he would bar logging as well as road building in the roadless areas. And he strongly suggested that he would extend the same protections to the Tongass, where conservation efforts have been opposed by Alaska's influential Congressional delegation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be a national priority to preserve these roadless areas as they are, no ifs, ands or buts about it,'' Mr. Gore said. ''No more destructive development and exploitation. And just so I'm crystal clear about it, no new road building and no timber sales in the roadless areas of our national forests. Period.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the Tongass, Mr. Gore added, ''I will ensure total and permanent protection for the roadless areas in the Tongass, America's great temperate rain forest.''

  ''His environmental achievements are the most extensive of any public official in high office,'' said Deb Callahan, president of the league. ''Without Al Gore and this administration, we would already be experiencing a dramatic backward slide on the environment.''

 <textdata>
  Beyond its new environmental promises, Mr. Gore's speech was notable for not mentioning Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival. The vice president has been criticized by some fellow Democrats for spending too much time in recent weeks attacking Mr. Bush rather than explaining where he would lead the country.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But if Mr. Gore gave his Republican opponent a pass today, Ms. Callahan, who worked on Mr. Gore's 1988 presidential campaign, did not. She asserted that Mr. Bush had done little to reduce air pollution or improve state parks in Texas. And she accused Mr. Bush of pandering to big corporate polluters that have contributed generously to his campaigns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''George W. Bush's appointees to key cabinet and administrative positions predict an administration of, by and for the special interests,'' she said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Bush's administration had actually added nearly 91,000 acres to the state park system and had significantly reduced the release of toxic pollutants into the air, water and soil.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''When Al Gore chooses surrogates to pollute Governor Bush's record, he should choose ones that have their facts straight,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''The new Al Gore is the same old Al Gore. The negative campaigning will continue.''
 </textdata>

  Many environmentalists expect the Sierra Club to back Mr. Gore by the fall. Indeed, the group has already spent $250,000 on television commercials attacking Mr. Bush's environmental record. The spots are being broadcast in Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin and will begin running in Ohio this week.

  In proposing new protections for the national forests, Mr. Gore stepped into an emerging national debate over development in some of the nation's wildest lands.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Forest Service officials have said that simply banning road building would significantly reduce future logging in the roadless areas. But Mr. Gore sided today with environmentalists, who contend that unless logging is specifically prohibited, helicopter logging and other activities could damage the land.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore did not consult with Mr. Clinton about today's speech, advisers to the vice president said. But aides to the two men did confer beforehand.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his speech today, Mr. Gore also pledged to prevent oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. And he asserted that passing campaign finance reform legislation would be a form of environmental protection, because it would reduce the influence of big corporate polluters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also defended his 1992 book on the environment, ''Earth in the Balance,'' which was recently reissued, much to the glee of some Republicans who say it exposed Mr. Gore as an extremist on the issue. But today, Mr. Gore said: ''I am proud I wrote that book. I stand by every word in that book.''

  It was the most overcaffeinated entry into a race since George Bush announced Dan Quayle as his running mate in New Orleans. Little Danny, another Congressional pup itching for the sun, raced up and hugged the startled Mr. Bush, looking, for one terrifying moment, as if he were going to lick the older man's cheek.

  She called no one. Juan calmed down. But the disquieting choice that Ms. Marquez, 26, faced that evening underscored a larger, complicated fact of family life in Bushwick and other neighborhoods like it across the city. There, where the Administration for Children's Services is regarded as a potent, ubiquitous presence, there is a real everyday fear that a momentary crisis can become something worse. That a parental mistake can lead to an investigation. Or that in the nightmare case, a difficult child can be taken away.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today, 20 out of every 1,000 children in Bushwick are in the city's protective custody, a rate 10 times as high as it is in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and seven times what it is in solidly middle-class Bayside, Queens, according to city figures. And in Bushwick, there were 1,413 investigations of neglect or abuse complaints in 1998, the most recent year for which statistics are available, while there were only 109 on the Upper East Side.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If the stakes are high for Bushwick parents, so, too, are they for the city. The next flawed investigation could be the next high-profile tragedy, and the city, which has stepped up enforcement in recent years, has been alternately criticized for sometimes failing to spot children in grave danger and at other times for removing children far too rashly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Parents in Bushwick talk with dread about the possibility that missing eyeglasses or a broken arm could result in accusations of child abuse. Some carry documents clearing them of child abuse charges in case they find themselves being questioned by a caseworker. They tell one another to always have a doctor's note for school absences. They warn their children about what can happen if they tell tall tales at school.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Historically, anywhere from two-thirds to three-quarters of the tens of thousands of reports of possible neglect or abuse investigated by the city's child welfare agency every year turn out to be unwarranted. And while parents in Bushwick say vigilance in reporting concerns is a good thing, they feel they are living out every parenting move under suspicion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Such suspicions and fear that abound in a neighborhood like Bushwick do not make things easier for the agency's caseworkers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Sitting along the Brooklyn-Queens border, Bushwick is among the city's poorest neighborhoods. Nine out of 10 children in the school district here live below the federal poverty line. A majority of residents are blacks and Latinos, and growing numbers among them are newcomers from Mexico and the Dominican Republic, with little or no ability to communicate in English.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That, as Ms. Moore well remembers from her visits throughout Brooklyn, can be a delicate balance. In more affluent communities, school officials and others who spot something suspicious are more likely to discuss it with the family before calling the government. In Bushwick, she says, that may not always happen.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For their part, Administration for Children's Services officials point out that their investigations are naturally concentrated in neighborhoods where most of the complaints come from. At the top of the list are Central and East Harlem, a cluster of neighborhoods in the South Bronx, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville in Brooklyn, followed by neighborhoods like Jamaica, Queens, the Lower East Side of Manhattan and Bushwick.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For now, in Bushwick, fear still runs high. Parents speak of their encounters with the agency as though they were speaking of law enforcement. Classes on how to be a good parent are referred to as probation, while a complaint filed with the child abuse register is likened to having a record that can haunt one later.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That leeriness carries an additional danger. It can, says Andrew Friedman, a community organizer in Bushwick, keep parents who may be in fact struggling with their children from turning to the very institution designed to help families in trouble -- the child welfare agency.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It ends up being a menacing presence rather than a helpful presence in the rare instances where they're needed,'' said Mr. Friedman, co-director of Make the Road by Walking, a storefront group that advocates on behalf of Bushwick's poor. ''It's a power that's not on their side, that's distrustful of them.''

  GREEN PASTURES  Some are lush and others are arid, but all of the stops on Gov. George W. Bush's four-day trek through the West will prove fertile -- with money. Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, reaped an estimated $100,000 for his campaign at a luncheon in Denver on Tuesday and was expected to raise $300,000 for the Republican National Committee and $125,000 for the State Republican Party in New Mexico at a reception in Albuquerque on Tuesday night. By week's end, after visits to Arizona and Nevada as well, Mr. Bush should collect $350,000 for his campaign, $200,000 for state Republican organizations and about $2 million for the national committee, campaign officials said. They said Mr. Bush would raise $1.3 million in regulated ''hard money'' for the committee and at least several hundred thousand dollars in largely unregulated ''soft money.''

  AD ADVISORY  Gov. George W. Bush is turning to an executive of one of the nation's best-known advertising agency, Young &amp; Rubicam, for creative suggestions on television commercials. Jim Ferguson, the advertising agency's chief creative officer, has accepted an unpaid, advisory role in the campaign, said Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant and a member of Maverick Media, the advertising arm of the Bush campaign. ''We have tremendous respect for what these guys do, and there are skills they have that are almost uniquely suited to a presidential campaign,'' Mr. Stevens said. Mr. Ferguson will assemble an informal group of people in New York who may be asked to help write Mr. Bush's television commercials, Mr. Stevens said. Mr. Ferguson, through an assistant, declined to comment.

  PRAISE FROM McCAIN  Gov. George W. Bush's recent statements on arms-control policy, missile defense and trade with China have drawn hearty praise from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. In an op-ed article in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal, Mr. McCain applauded Mr. Bush for embracing internationalist positions that benefit America's interests. Now if only more Republicans in Congress would follow Mr. Bush's lead, Mr. McCain lamented, citing the Senate's vote to reject setting a deadline to withdraw  ground troops from Kosovo. Only 15 Senate Republicans, including Mr. McCain, backed the measure.

  ''My opponent -- who's no stranger to exaggeration, I might add --  boasts on his Web site that he has been intimately involved in the best-managed build-down in American military history,'' Mr. Bush said, an unmistakable sprinkling of sarcasm in his voice.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Al Gore claims that qualifies him for a promotion,'' Mr. Bush continued. But, he said, ''the Clinton-Gore record cries out for a new sign on the Pentagon that says 'Under New Management.' ''

  Mr. Bush's pointed remarks represented an effort by the Texas governor to turn the tables on Mr. Gore and blunt the questions that Mr. Gore and other administration officials have raised about how well Mr. Bush is prepared to manage the country's military and foreign affairs.
 </textdata>

  Political analysts have long considered Mr. Bush's inexperience on the global stage, along with several gaffes that underscored it, to be a significant potential weak spot in his candidacy. Over the last week, both Mr. Gore and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen have expressed particular concern over Mr. Bush's proposal for the research and development of a missile defense system vaster than the one being considered by the Clinton administration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cohen, a Republican, warned that it could lead to an arms buildup by other countries, and, in an appearance on a Sunday television news program, he even invited Mr. Bush in for a briefing by Defense Department officials. Mr. Bush, making his first public comments on the matter today, implied that he would not be R.S.V.P.-ing anytime soon.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I found the comments to be political in nature,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference here after his speech at the veterans' post. He said  he had been amply informed and advised by his own team of foreign policy and defense experts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I think the briefing I got from Colin Powell and Dick Cheney and Henry Kissinger was substantial,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I've got one of the finest foreign policy teams ever assembled, and I call upon my opponent not to allow members of the administration to politicize matters of defense.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush made no acknowledgment today that some military cutbacks began before the Clinton administration, when Mr. Bush's father was president. Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said that low military pay was a problem then, too and that there were about 19,400 service people on food stamps in 1991, in President George Bush's administration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Hattaway noted that the vice president had made his own set of proposals for strengthening the military and increasing spending on defense, particularly for higher pay for enlisted men and women. And Mr. Hattaway questioned whether Mr. Bush was the right person to be raising concerns about military preparedness.

  During a telephone conference call with reporters that was arranged by the Democratic National Committee, former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown made those criticisms even more personal, questioning the nature of Mr. Bush's military service in the Vietnam War.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush did not serve overseas but instead served in Houston in the Texas Air National Guard. Mr. Gore went to Vietnam as an Army journalist.

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's complaint with the health of the country's armed forces was not new, but he rendered it in especially strong terms today. Mr. Bush has said he would call for an extra $1 billion a year over what Congress had already agreed to pay in salary increases for men and women serving in the military. That is one of several ways in which he would spend more on national defense, which he says is currently being shortchanged.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Defense spending as a percentage of the gross national product is the lowest it has been since prior to Pearl Harbor,'' Mr. Bush said today as he presented a litany of facts and figures to portray a military in alarming decline. ''United States Air Force readiness for combat has fallen to its lowest level in 15 years.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Before we commit troops, there has to be a clear strategy,'' Mr. Bush said, citing Bosnia and Haiti as two examples of places where that was arguably not the case.

  On another NBC outlet, MSNBC, George W. Bush will sit down for an interview with Chris Matthews on his ''Hardball'' program tomorrow night at 7. This interview will be conducted live, from a restaurant named El Pinto in Albuquerque.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-31-2000

  Mr. Matthews said he planned to emphasize education, Social Security, missile defense, possible running mates and Mr. Bush's campaign strategy against Al Gore.

  Vice President Al Gore commemorated the nation's war dead today by recounting his own military experiences in Vietnam and the complex web of emotions, from patriotism to family devotion to guilt, that caused him to enlist three decades ago.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a speech before several hundred people gathered for a Memorial Day ceremony here, Mr. Gore acknowledged that his five months in Vietnam as an Army reporter had not been the most grueling or dangerous, saying, ''I know that my service doesn't in any way match that of the heroes we honor on this day.''

 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But his time in a combat zone taught him much about sacrifice, honor and loyalty among soldiers, he said in a speech largely devoid of policy, politics or any mention of his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush, who was a fighter pilot in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War, attended another Memorial Day event, delivering brief remarks that were less personal than Mr. Gore's but that also steered mostly clear of politics and the presidential campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although he opposed the war in Vietnam, Mr. Gore enlisted in the Army just two months after graduating from Harvard in 1969. Friends have said he signed up in part to protect his father, Senator Albert Gore, an antiwar Democrat who was running for re-election, from criticism by Republicans who supported the war effort. That was a factor to which one longtime associate of the vice president referred in the ceremonies today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in his own talk here, Mr. Gore offered another reason for enlisting, suggesting that he could not have faced the guilt in knowing that some other young man from his Tennessee town had gone in his place, and perhaps been killed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore described feeling disillusioned upon returning to a nation that was ambivalent, and sometimes hostile, toward Vietnam veterans. That disillusionment, he said, kept him from running for public office for several years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As for Mr. Bush, who spent much of the last month trying to bolster his foreign-policy credentials with proposals related to national defense and remarks on international affairs, he made only the slightest detour in that direction today, calling anew for the development of a vast national defense against ballistic missiles. Both Mr. Gore and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen have recently questioned the prudence of his call for a system much larger than the limited defense the Clinton administration has proposed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush reiterated his own position in a context of a general plea for strengthening the country's armed forces.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Similarly, Mr. Gore said his time living in a trailer park with his wife, Tipper, while he was in training in Alabama had taught him about the need to improve the pay, benefits and housing of active-duty military personnel. And both men said that while it was important to pay tribute to war service with monuments and medals, it was even more important to share with young Americans the details of sacrifice.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We must pass stories of American courage and character to the next generation, to capture their imaginations, to raise a monument in their hearts,'' Mr. Bush said. ''This is the way our democracy renews its promise: by celebrating American heroes and American values without hesitation and without apology.''

  Paying Tribute to War Dead  Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush commemorated the nation's war dead in speeches that mostly avoided politics. Mr. Gore recounted some of his own military experiences in Vietnam and discussed reasons behind his enlistment.

  The latest numbers offered a stunning contradiction: a 3.9 percent unemployment rate, the lowest in 30 years, and two major national polls showing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas leading Vice President Al Gore by 5 percentage points.

 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  So why isn't the booming economy blowing Mr. Bush away? Have the rules changed?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  First, the economy has stayed strong so long that most people are not worrying about it. Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster, said, ''It doesn't sit there as a major worry that people talk about.'' Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster who collaborates with Mr. Hart on the NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll, said one reason for Bush support among older people was that ''only about 6 percent of the old people have economic worries.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Second, Mr. Gore does not get credit for the way things are. Polls show the public gives it to President Clinton and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That may be reasonable enough, but Mr. Gore's own weakness as a candidate compounds that problem. After all, Mr. Gore is campaigning on a promise to keep the same economic policies Mr. Clinton has followed, while Mr. Bush's central campaign message is that he wants a very big tax cut.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the NBC/Journal poll showed that only 27 percent of voters thought Mr. Gore was very likely or fairly likely to pursue policies that would keep the economy strong, compared to 32 percent who said that of Mr. Bush. (Both of them enjoyed less credence than they did in December, when 36 percent had confidence in Mr. Gore and 43 percent in Mr. Bush.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The NBC/Journal poll had Mr. Bush ahead, 46 percent to 41 percent. A Gallup Poll for CNN and USA Today had the Bush lead at 49 to 44. Both polls were taken the last weekend of April, and the margin of sampling error for the NBC/Journal survey was plus or minus three percentage points, one less than for the Gallup Poll.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has simply not capitalized on winning his party's nomination more easily than Mr. Bush won his or achieving quickly the party unity and support from Bill Bradley that Mr. Bush is still seeking from Senator John McCain.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Teeter said the data in the NBC/Journal poll explained it. ''Gore is not a very good candidate,'' he said. ''He is not a very likable candidate.'' Mr. Teeter argued that Mr. Gore's frequent attacks on Mr. Bush ran the risk ''of looking like the guy who is out of his time,'' out of step with an optimistic country.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There is no question that the Gore message in the summer and fall will emphasize continuity and accuse Mr. Bush of risking prosperity for a needless tax cut. Comparisons with the last Republican administration are inevitable, but will have special bite because the phrase ''Bush recession'' will surely be used.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Hart, while conceding Mr. Gore's weak standing, cited a focus group he conducted last Tuesday in a Philadelphia suburb as offering hope for Mr. Gore. Everyone in the group of 12, whether he or she favored Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore, ''wanted the same policies,'' he said. ''They didn't want to tinker with the economy.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Al Gore is sitting on a gusher,'' Mr. Hart said, if he can find a way to identify himself with the voters' desire for continuity.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The best evidence that it is not too late for Mr. Gore comes from a New York Times/CBS News Poll taken in May 1988. That was the last time a vice president ran to succeed a popular president in an economic boom. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis led Vice President George Bush, 49 percent to 39 percent. It did not last.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Other money has been used to hire prominent Republican consultants who could help Mr. Pataki in a future run for national office. For instance, Benjamin L. Ginsberg, an elections specialist at the Washington law firm of Patton Boggs, whose clients include Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, billed $7,264 in legal fees as recently as March. Stephen Moore, an economist with the Cato Institute in Washington, received $27,500 for fine-tuning Mr. Pataki's fiscal proposals, while Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan, was paid $10,000 to polish his words.

  The festival was started in 1979 by the Coalition of Asian Pacific Americans when President Jimmy Carter designated Asian-American Heritage Week. (President George Bush later expanded the designation to encompass the month of May). For many years, it drew several hundred people, most of whom had ties to the 30 or so nonprofit groups that set up booths. These included organizations like the Chinatown Health Clinic and the Basement Workshop, an arts collective.

  ''If depth of knowledge about government won elections, then both Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale would've beaten Ronald Reagan,'' said Orin Kramer, an adviser to Mr. Corzine.

  Gov. George W. Bush has never been considered much of a wordsmith. But bit by bit, he is developing a political dictionary all his own.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For example, when Vice President Al Gore distorts the Texas governor's record and proposals, at least as Mr. Bush sees it, Mr. Gore is not ''lying,'' two syllables that never escape Mr. Bush's lips. Rather, Mr. Gore is behaving in a manner that is ''disappointing,'' four syllables that the governor much prefers and has begun to use ad nauseam.

  And while Mr. Bush, the de facto Republican presidential nominee, says that he will soon identify numerous ways in which the government can save money, none of these plans will be ''cuts,'' a four-letter word that the candidate avoids. They will be ''savings'' that make the government more ''efficient'' -- kinder, gentler terms.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  It is a name game all the more interesting for the fact that Mr. Bush, with little smiles and wiggles of his eyebrows, wholly acknowledges that he is playing it. And this unspoken but unmistakable admission has precipitated endless rounds of semantic jousting between Mr. Bush and reporters, who are constantly trying to get him to say what he clearly means.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm just disappointed,'' Mr. Bush said, with a ''nice-try'' twinkle and grin. ''I think that's the word I'd like to use. It's a disappointing thing.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, a savvy enough candidate, understands that in politics, diction establishes tone, and tone is everything. And he turns to euphemisms to resolve inherent tensions in his campaign, like his pledge to run a positive race and his simultaneous resolve to wage an aggressive fight that exposes what he believes to be Mr. Gore's shortcomings.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He did the same thing in the primaries, watering down the nouns and verbs he used to describe and disparage his principal opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona. Mr. Bush's mantra at the time was that Mr. McCain ''says one thing and does another.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush flinched at the mere suggestion. No, he said, it made the senator a man practiced in the ways of ''Washington,'' a word that was perhaps dirtier but much less explicitly mean-spirited.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Throughout the Republican primaries, the Bush campaign trumpeted seemingly any and every endorsement, whether it came from the governor of a large state or the secretary of a small sewing circle.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But last week, the Bush campaign took that tendency to the outer limits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush showed reporters in the back of his campaign plane a recent copy of Weekly World News, a supermarket tabloid, with a cover story on the extraterrestrial support he was receiving. The front page featured a photograph of the governor standing beside an oblong, hairless, vaguely reptilian space alien.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And as Mr. Bush noted, his alien encounter was further proof of his commitment to expanding the Republican Party's appeal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The exchange also went to show what a prankster and funnyman Mr. Bush fancies himself, a persona on vivid display last week.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was hurling accusations and put-downs in the governor's direction, and Mr. Bush was laughing, establishing a contrast that may not have been accidental in the least.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush said the man was really ''mooning authority.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The governor seemed a bit less sanguine when the topic turned to a profile, in a major magazine, of the campaign's chief strategist, Karl Rove. Mr. Bush has a thing about advisers eclipsing the candidates they serve.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And he jokingly wondered what he should expect next: a Playgirl magazine pictorial of his campaign manager, Joe Allbaugh? Mr. Allbaugh is older and burlier than a typical centerfold, but Mr. Bush had a vision.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  By contrast (and both are Democrats, so this is a nonpartisan analysis), Gore at the Gridiron emulated a style perfected two generations ago by John Kennedy at a memorable Al Smith memorial dinner in New York. Hard to believe, but Gore, like J.F.K., played to the people in the room with an unexpectedly light touch, using lines attuned to his politically sensitive audience.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So Gore reportedly stepped to the lectern and asked for a glass of iced tea. Small laugh. He took the glass and slowly drained it all the way to the bottom, as the tittering grew. Then he carefully returned the glass to the waiter and delivered the punch line: ''I can't stay long.''

  During my years in public office, one issue I got the most mail about was my hair, with questions like, ''How do you wear your hair when you're dressed up?'' I was urged to dye my hair, and people even enclosed checks to pay for a makeover. In no audience I've ever spoken to have I found a man who sent Al Gore a check for Rogaine or asked Newt Gingrich to get a haircut. I would have hoped that we could have erased such differences by the dawn of the 21st century. But now, it seems, the only way to imagine a woman in the White House is to put Barbie there. I'm sorry, but I just can't get enthusiastic. I can see my hero, Eleanor Roosevelt, sitting in heaven, shaking her head and saying, ''They still don't get it!''

  ''People have an understanding of how markets work, and are used to securing a higher return on their savings,'' said one adviser to Mr. Bush. ''The debate on Social Security will be joined in a way that we believe will be open to new ideas.''

  Mr. Gore's aides said they would portray Mr. Bush's approach as too risky for many individuals because it would leave their retirement security exposed to the ups and downs of the stock market. They expect that argument to have particular resonance if Wall Street remains as volatile as it has been in recent months.

  Mr. Gore has made eliminating the public debt the centerpiece of his economic agenda, saying that to do so would push interest rates down and give the entire economy a boost. The vice president backs a plan that would leave Social Security intact but would extend its solvency to 2050 by allocating interest savings from the reduction in the national debt to the retirement system.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush plans to give a major speech on Social Security sometime in May, and to press the issue from then on, his aides said. He will not offer a detailed plan, but rather will commit himself to a set of principles that he would use as the basis for bipartisan negotiations if he was elected president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Those principles start with the establishment of private accounts. Mr. Bush will probably not specify what portion of a worker's payroll taxes could go into the accounts, but he is leaning toward making participation in the accounts voluntary, his advisers said. Under this approach, a portion of the retirement benefit would be guaranteed and a portion would fluctuate with the performance of the investment account.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As the system stands now, payroll taxes on today's workers go to pay benefits for current retirees. Mr. Bush's plan would start shifting Social Security toward a system in which each worker saved something for his or her own retirement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000

 <textdata>
  ''The key is going to be augmenting the current pay-as-you-go system with a prefunded system based on personal accounts,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Bush campaign's chief economic adviser.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush will also pledge not to increase payroll taxes, and not to reduce benefits for anyone in or nearing retirement. He has left open whether the retirement age, which is already rising gradually to 67 from 65, might eventually need to be increased again.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Most of the privatization proposals put on the table in the last few years envision about two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax paid by each worker being channeled into individual accounts. Privately, Mr. Bush's aides say they envision a plan of roughly the same scale.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Under Mr. Gore's plan, all of the Social Security surplus would go to reducing the national debt held by the public. Mr. Bush's approach would almost certainly have to forgo large-scale reduction in the public debt. But because Mr. Bush's plan would give workers their own retirement accounts, it would decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay benefits out of tax revenues, which is another form of debt reduction.

  Those states, and other crucial battlegrounds like Florida, have high proportions of older voters, who in the past could have been counted on to react strongly against any major changes to Social Security. Democrats remain confident that Mr. Bush's proposal will help drive older voters to Mr. Gore, but Republican strategists said that assumption might prove outdated.
 </textdata>

  ''The question that this election cycle will test,'' said one adviser to Mr. Bush, ''is whether times have changed enough through the emergence of a new investor class, and through the recognition that Social Security is going broke, that new solutions can be found.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The adviser said that neither party could be sure of the answer. Still, the issue is likely to help Democrats mobilize their traditional constituencies. In particular, Democrats said any push by Mr. Bush to privatize Social Security would be met by stiff resistance from labor unions.

  Here's evidence that we're getting traction: President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have detected the growing political appeal of personal privacy in a time of data rape. To a commencement audience yesterday, Clinton unveiled his plan to repel the invaders, challenging the Republican Congress to get on with legislation to stem the tide of snooping.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Up to now, the Clinton-Gore record has been troubling to civil libertarians; under the rubric of searching for ''deadbeat dads,'' this administration now forces private employers to inform on workers to federal bureaucrats as never before. But Clinton's belated concern about penetrations of our privacy by marketers and e-snoops, often in support of legislation already in work, is welcome.

  What about sharing financial data having nothing to do with medical records? Here the Clinton-Gore plan caves in to the secret salesmen. ''We will preserve financial firms' ability to share the information that they need,'' goes the administration proposal, ''to develop new products and manage their risks . . .'' No bank is required to obtain depositor's consent; it's up to the individual to ''opt out'' -- to take the difficult initiative of demanding that the bank not make his life an open book.

  There was a strong political subtext to the day. Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization, told the audience, ''We must elect Al Gore as president of the United States,'' arguing that ''the very future of the U.S. Supreme Court for the next generation hangs in the balance.''

  From what we can tell of his foreign policy, Governor Bush does not prepare us to meet the grand challenges of both the classic and new security agendas. . . .
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Governor Bush dangerously fixates on the cold war past when speaking of the use of force. He suggests that he would not intervene to relieve even the brutal repression of ethnic cleansing and genocide. No wonder it took him six weeks to say anything about our action against the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Is that the right message for America to send to people around the globe struggling for freedom?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Stuck in a cold war mindset, Governor Bush continues to view Russia and China primarily as present or future enemies. While we must remain vigilant against any deterioration in our relationships, the reality of the global age is that Russia and China are indeed competitors, but also vital partners in our efforts to tackle problems menacing to us all.
 </textdata>

  Just this past week, Governor Bush used his brief meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov to issue a warning that his intention would be to build and deploy a global Star Wars system that he believes could defend the U.S. and all our allies against any missile launch from any source. In the 1990's, most serious analysts took a look at the implausibility of this endeavor, the fantastical price that our taxpayers would be expected to pay, and the dangerously destabilizing consequences of traveling down that path and rejected this notion. Governor Bush wishes to return to it, and chose the worst possible venue in which to launch -- for lack of a better phrase -- his risky foreign policy scheme. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When it comes to the challenges of the new security agenda, Governor Bush's foreign policy is noticeably blank. Although Africa represents a vast untapped market, has major health and environmental concerns that directly impact us, and the reaches of modern terrorism took American lives in two of our embassies on that continent, Governor Bush said that Africa ''doesn't fit into the national strategic interests.'' Is that a responsible assessment of our national interest?

  One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership. Since 1994, the Republicans in Congress have recklessly tossed aside decades of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Lott is reportedly offering a half-dozen federal judges for approval by the Senate in return for Democratic cooperation on Mr. Smith. Mr. Lott regards the offer as magnanimous. It is in fact insulting. For several years, he and other Republicans have thrown up one road block after another to President Clinton's judicial appointments -- a partisan debasing of the honored principle under which the Senate advises and consents on presidential nominations. This year he has allowed confirmation of only seven judges. When the tables were turned in 1992, also a hotly contested election year, a Democratic-controlled Senate was serious enough about its responsibilities to approve 66 judges nominated by President George Bush, a Republican.

  Which might have been fine except for the fact that Dr. Archer, a gynecologist, has said so much crazy stuff in the past. In the early 1990's, Dr. Archer was a deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where he served as the Bush administration's point person on the so-called gag rule, the regulation that barred doctors at federally financed family planning clinics from discussing abortion with women.

  ''Where was he when it was time to stand up and be counted in Seattle?'' she asked, talking about the meeting of the World Trade Organization in December that was disrupted by violent protests, and where an administration effort to start a new round of global trade talks had collapsed. Mr. Gore stayed away from the meeting, partly to avoid angering union members who were demonstrating. President Clinton attended the session for a day and a half.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore offered his strongest endorsement yet of the China trade pact in a speech in Boston today,  saying he would work to win votes for its approval, even if it meant angering his labor constituency. But Ms. Rice was not impressed. ''It's about time,'' she said. ''The vote's in three weeks.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000

 <textdata>
  The exchange was particularly notable because foreign policy has played only a bit role in the presidential campaign. Mr. Bush has delivered one major speech on the subject, devoted almost entirely to security issues. That left him vulnerable to Mr. Gore's assertion today that the Texas governor ''dangerously fixates on the cold war past'' but has not dealt with the major issues of economic globalization that form some of the toughest foreign policy challenges.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Rice, who was a Russia specialist on the National Security Council in President George Bush's administration, said Governor Bush was planning a series of foreign policy speeches, starting with trade. But she said that the timing of those speeches had not been set.
 </textdata>

  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The vice president himself oversaw Gore-Chernomyrdin,'' she said, referring to meetings between Mr. Gore and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, on issues that included security and economic transformation. ''At the time it was very clear that Chernomyrdin and others who the vice president was calling 'reformers' were stealing the country blind, with the money going into Swiss bank accounts.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The essence of Mr. Gore's critique today was that Mr. Bush was aligned with right-wing Republicans and regarded both Russia and China as ''future enemies'' rather than partners and competitors. Ms. Rice argued that Mr. Gore had deliberately misstated Mr. Bush's views, incorrectly casting him as a cold warrior and an isolationist. ''The interests of the U.S. are served by engagement with Russia and China,'' she said, ''but you have to engage them in a realistic way, not a romantic one.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I would not call either country a threat, but both are challenges,'' she said, using terminology close to Mr. Gore's. She said Mr. Gore had mischaracterized Mr. Bush's views on missile defenses, an area of dispute with Russia. She enlisted Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a mainstream Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, to declare that Mr. Gore's speech was a compendium of foreign policy problems ''rather than a strategic vision.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000

  She also said Mr. Gore had participated in decisions to ''cut military procurement by 13 percent'' since the beginning of the Clinton administration.

  The Gore campaign has been sifting through the detritus of the elder Mr. Bush's steamrolling of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and has unearthed useful lessons. Those lessons, for an incumbent vice president defending a relatively popular administration against a sitting governor, are becoming increasingly evident. The basic thrust: try to hamstring the opponent by raising questions about his record and his readiness to be president.

  Neither the Gore campaign nor the Bush campaign particularly likes the analogy. The Gore team says it is having a high-minded policy debate and is not employing negative personal attacks. The Bush campaign says Mr. Gore, unlike Vice President George Bush in 1988, is misrepresenting the governor's record.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Their routes may be different, but the Gore campaign arrives at the same place Governor Bush's father arrived a dozen years ago. They both present a sitting vice president as the responsible steward of the current peace and prosperity. And they both cast the challenger as risky and irresponsible and his state as an alien universe that is culturally out of the mainstream. Already, Texas has been portrayed as such an aberration that it almost resembles, well, Massachusetts in 1988.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush began this campaign much the way Governor Dukakis began his, as the respected if little-known executive of a state that had appeared to make strides economically and socially.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Part of this was Mr. Dukakis's  fault. He did not think Vice President Bush's attacks were worth answering. And he slapped on a helmet and climbed into a battle tank, providing perhaps the most enduring, if hapless, image of his campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This time around, Mr. Gore's chief criticism of Mr. Bush was initially confined to the governor's ''risky tax scheme.'' But he has ratcheted up that criticism every day. Now the word ''risky,'' supplemented by ''irresponsible'' and ''reckless,'' is applied to the entire Bush world view. The risky tax scheme begets a risky economic plan, which encompasses risky health and education plans and so on.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So in a major foreign policy speech in Boston today, Mr. Gore criticized Mr. Bush for talking about a costly and controversial Star Wars missile defense plan in his meeting with the foreign minister of Russia and said the Texan ''chose the worst possible venue in which to launch -- for lack of a better phrase -- his risky foreign policy scheme.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the domestic policy front, Mr. Gore has portrayed Mr. Bush's Texas as a backwater with substandard education and inadequate health insurance and its residents as so gun-happy that the governor signed a bill allowing them to take weapons into churches. Further, Mr. Gore likes to link Governor Bush with the ''failed'' policies of his father and refers often to ''the Bush-Quayle recession.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush was ''stuck in a cold war mindset'' and that he would have to fill in the ''gaps'' in his knowledge of foreign policy with the right-wing isolationist ideology of Congressional Republicans like Senator Jesse Helms.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But if Mr. Gore has learned from the 1988 campaign, so has Governor Bush. Instead of allowing Mr. Gore to define him the way Vice President Bush defined Governor Dukakis, Governor Bush has tried to the avoid the extremist conservative box Mr. Gore has tried to put him in.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush has spent much time reaching for the political center, especially on issues like education and health care, which have traditionally been viewed as more favorable to Democrats. And he has emphasized bipartisanship and his ability to work with Democrats.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush has also been quicker to respond to attacks than was Governor Dukakis. Unlike Mr. Dukakis, Governor Bush is not only resisting Mr. Gore's caricature of him but is constructing his own caricature of Mr. Gore, as the candidate who does not tell the truth and is bent on a campaign of destruction. The constant refrain from the Bush campaign is that Mr. Gore ''will say anything to get elected.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has pushed away any suggestion that he is being negative, saying he believes the country wants a healthy debate on the issues people care about. He has already signaled what some of those issues will be and how he intends to use them, as in recent days, when he excoriated Mr. Bush's record on the environment by calling Texas the most polluted state in the country, citing Houston's chronic air pollution as an example.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And while some in the Gore campaign have been studying the 1988 campaign -- its similarities include an incumbent vice president who began the campaign in double digits behind a governor -- his spokesman rejects the idea that the 1988 Bush campaign is any kind of model.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We're putting out our positive vision,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore. ''The difference is that in 1988, Bush's goal was to pull down Dukakis.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  ''Bowling Alone'' touched a public nerve and became a metaphor for a much larger national malaise. Mr. Putnam suddenly found himself profiled in People magazine.

  ''I challenge Governor Bush to make the same pledge,'' Mr. Gore said in an interview with Political Points, the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News. ''Will he veto any bill that lets gun manufacturers off the hook? Will he fight for the gun industry or for America's families?''
 </textdata>

  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was referring to a 1999 law that required lawsuits against gun makers to be filed, on behalf of Texas cities or counties, by the state attorney general, who might or might not support that course of action. The measure was similar to ones supported by other Republican governors, and reflected their general push to curb civil litigation in an array of areas.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  The divergent statements of Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush continued an often tense back-and-forth over gun control that has lasted several days and signaled the potential potency of the issue in the 2000 elections. Each candidate has been trying to cast doubt on his opponent's commitment to gun control, and each has been trying to tar the other by linking him to the National Rifle Association.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At his news conference, Mr. Bush said that Mr. Gore had a voting history in Congress of support for the N.R.A.'s positions and a good deal of explaining to do.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>

  As Mr. Bush's aides circulated a brief document, titled ''Al Gore &amp; Guns,'' that cited examples from the 1980's of Mr. Gore's agreements with the gun lobby, the governor used a news conference here today to cast the vice president as a candidate whose current advocacy of more stringent restrictions on firearms was simply the latest fashion, not a matter of steadfast principle.

  ''When it was convenient politically, he voted one way,'' Mr. Bush said, ''and when it's convenient politically, he's changed his tune.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also refused to back off his suggestion on Thursday that Mr. Gore was once a member of the N.R.A. and, when challenged today to say how he knew that, offered no proof.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Instead, he reminded reporters that he ended his statement about Mr. Gore and the N.R.A. with the phrase ''if I'm not mistaken,'' and told them it was their job to verify the assertion and Mr. Gore's responsibility to show that he was not a member of the group.
 </textdata>

  William Powers, a spokesman for the gun organization, said he had found no evidence that Mr. Gore had been a member. But he said that when Mr. Gore was a congressman from Tennessee, ''he certainly received very high ratings from the N.R.A.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said that it could not find any record of Mr. Gore's ever being a member of the N.R.A., and that the vice president ''doesn't have any recollection of it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''But it's an irrelevant issue anyway,'' Mr. Hattaway added. ''Al Gore is standing up to the N.R.A.'s leadership and its increasingly extreme agenda, while Bush is doing their bidding.''
 </textdata>

  The exchanges between the Bush and Gore campaigns were touched off in part by a gun control group's distribution this week of a television commercial featuring footage of an N.R.A. official saying that if Mr. Bush became president, the organization would be working out of the White House. Mr. Bush said that was not true.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His efforts today to turn the tables on Mr. Gore seemed to reflect not only the ascendancy of gun control as a political issue but also Mr. Bush's desire to court swing voters, many of whom favor greater regulation of firearms.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Bush took his swipes at Mr. Gore during his third day of campaigning in California, a state full of such voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, Mr. Bush's campaign schedule here this week represented an especially aggressive attempt to portray the Texas governor as a progressive, open-minded Republican by emphasizing his sensitivity of religious and ethnic diversity.
 </textdata>

  In recognition of Cinco de Mayo, a Mexican-American holiday, Mr. Bush delivered a long address here this morning on the shared values of Latinos and other Americans. In it Mr. Bush used more Spanish phrases and sentences than he had previously used on the campaign trail this year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's remarks, delivered to hundreds of people at a ''breakfast fiesta'' sponsored by a private group called the U.S.-Mexico Foundation, followed a series of events, encounters and photo opportunities -- many of them filmed by the candidate's advertising team -- that put Mr. Bush together with Latino and Roman Catholic voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The first group is crucial to Mr. Bush's hopes of winning California. The second is key to his success nationwide, and Mr. Bush has been working especially hard to appeal to Catholics since his controversial appearance in February at Bob Jones University in South Carolina, a school with a history of anti-Catholic bias.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign also said today that Mr. Bush would postpone a speech about Social Security, scheduled for Monday, so that he could attend the funeral Mass for Cardinal John O'Connor in New York.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  According to the Bush campaign document about Mr. Gore's record on gun control in Congress, he supported a measure to remove a ban on interstate sales of rifles, shotguns and handguns; opposed a 14-day waiting period for handgun purchases, and from 1985 to 1990, as a  senator from Tennessee, cast votes that were in line with the wishes of the N.R.A. three-quarters of the time.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Hattaway noted that Mr. Gore now advocates a much wider array of restrictions on firearms than Mr. Bush, who signed legislation in Texas that permitted people to carry concealed handguns and seemed in other ways to agree with the N.R.A.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Recently, though, Mr. Bush chastised an official with the organization for making inflammatory statements about President Clinton. He also signaled a slightly greater receptiveness to some gun-control proposals. And he has tried to link Mr. Gore to the N.R.A.

  Vice President Al Gore promised today to spend billions of dollars to recruit new teachers and increase teachers' salaries, but only if the states and teachers' unions agreed that all new teachers meet rigorous national standards and only if hiring decisions are based on expertise, not seniority alone.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will ensure that there is a fully qualified, well-trained teacher in every single classroom, everywhere in this nation, before the next four years is out,'' Mr. Gore said in a speech here to the Michigan Education Association.

  Education ranks near the top of voter concerns, especially in important states like Michigan, where Mr. Gore held his fourth ''school day'' today, spending all day at the high school in nearby Holt.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The speech was yet another effort by Mr. Gore to spell out the details of his education plan, which would devote $115 billion to education over 10 years.
 </textdata>

  Education is an area to which Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has devoted considerable attention in hopes of wooing swing voters. Polls show Mr. Bush has been successful in this effort. The Gore campaign is countering Mr. Bush's initiatives with proposals that do not just allocate federal money but also make demands of teachers and school districts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore proposes requiring teachers to have majored in their subject area in college or to pass a competency test. He would reward outstanding teachers and help schools improve or remove bad teachers quickly, within the academic year as opposed to the three years that removal can take now, aides said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''While we absolutely must respect due process,'' Mr. Gore said, ''we have to put an end to endless delays in removing those few teachers who really do need to be removed.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gregory King, a spokesman for Sandra Feldman, the president of the federation, said Mr. Gore consulted with Ms. Feldman on his proposals. She was heartened, Mr. King said, that Mr. Gore would cede some decisions on teacher hiring to ''principals working with teams of teachers, and not just principals.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mary Elizabeth Teasley, the director of government relations for the nation's largest teachers' union, the National Education Association, said her union was comfortable with Mr. Gore's suggestion that seniority not be the only criterion in teacher hiring. She emphasized, however, that Mr. Gore was not dismissing seniority as a qualification.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has been trying to demonstrate his commitment to education in multiple ways, including by spending a full day at a school somewhere in the country every week or so. He spent today at Holt High after staying overnight at the home of Margot Strong, a computer teacher, and her husband, Jay, who teaches first grade. Mr. Gore arrived at their house after midnight on Thursday night and stayed up to watch on television four of the five overtime periods in the National Hockey League playoff game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins.
 </textdata>

  In an interview with the school newspaper, Mr. Gore was asked about abortion. He said he believed it was up to a woman to decide what to do, but he said he also believed in abstinence.

  WEIGHING BUDGET PROPOSALS -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas began a news conference in San Diego yesterday with some heavy lifting: he waved two thick books that represented budget proposals he had sent to the Texas Legislature in 1997 and 1999, and he lit into Vice President Al Gore anew for suggesting that he did not produce such extensive spending blueprints. The books in his hand, Mr. Bush said, proved otherwise. Only the day before, Mr. Gore had pulled from his pocket a three-page document that he said was a copy of Mr. Bush's 1995 budget, telling a reporter that ''if you think that's a budget, then maybe I can convince you it's a duck.'' Mr. Bush turned to examples from later years and said he was wishing fervently for a campaign ''not full of hyperbole and distortion.''

  LEADING THE RACE FOR NO. 2 -- Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore remain tight-lipped about running mates, but an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll has found that most voters have already made up their minds. Among Republicans and independents, 40 percent want Mr. Bush to pick Gen. Colin L. Powell, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 20 percent favor Senator John McCain of Arizona and 15 percent favor Elizabeth Dole, the former secretary of labor. Among Democrats and independents, 33 percent want Mr. Gore to pick former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and 18 percent favor Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. The poll surveyed 1,003 registered voters from April 29 to May 1 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

  As if to ratify Mr. Clinton's triumph, The Washington Post ran a front-page headline on Monday: '' 'Clinton Fatigue' Yields to Nostalgia.'' The Post cited polls showing that not only would Democrats vastly prefer Mr. Clinton to Al Gore as a candidate this year but that in a recent match-up the president pulled even with George W. Bush nationwide. Granted, this country has a short memory, but isn't Bill Clinton the same guy who was impeached and tried only 15 months ago? It's almost an insult to call him the comeback kid. He's had more comebacks than Elizabeth Taylor, Liza Minnelli and Richard Nixon combined.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But where, pray tell, are those hearings? Apparently Clinton nostalgia trumps whatever remains of his opponents' testosterone. Reflecting the president's clout, polls showed that 60 percent approved of the raid and 68 percent didn't want any hearings -- numbers consistent with those balking at impeachment hearings and the Congressional release of the Starr report two years ago. No sooner did the Elian inquisition flame out than Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Congressman, also decided not ''to pursue any more hearings'' on Hillary Clinton's government-paid transportation for her Senate campaign. Such is Mr. Clinton's political potency that James Rogan, a House impeachment prosecutor now battling for re-election in California, popped up with the impeached president in a White House rally for gun control. Surely it's only days before William Bennett concedes to Larry King that, all in all, the Clintons' marriage is more credible than that of the other aspiring senatorial couple, the Giulianis, who can't even fake a truce for the sake of their kids after a cancer diagnosis.  My first sighting of conspicuous Republican nostalgia for Mr. Clinton was in March, when Ben Stein, the former Nixon speechwriter and host of TV's ''Win Ben Stein's Money,'' praised the president in USA Today for showing ''a lot of heart'' by sending top administration officials to the funeral of his father, the G.O.P. economist Herbert Stein. Ben Stein dislikes Mr. Clinton, writes for the Clinton-bashing journal American Spectator and is solidly behind Mr. Bush. And yet he had this to say over the phone this week: ''I will miss Clinton's humanity like I miss Nixon's humanity. You know a person is a person by his failings, and Clinton has a lot of failings. Without that human touch, you lose an important ability to connect with the body politic. Two machines are running to replace him -- the Gore machine, in which everything is calculated and calibrated, and the Bush machine, which is even more so. I don't like the idea of being governed by a machine. I like being governed by someone who has as many failings as I do.''

  Mr. Hammond is ready to go with his impersonation of Al Gore -- possibly tonight -- but is mindful of the vast difference between the two men. ''Clinton only shows you what he wants you to see,'' he says. ''Gore shows you what he wants to show you and everything else. You see the puppet and the puppetmaster. You see the ventriloquist's mouth move. The poor guy is trying too hard. So much preparation, so earnest, so much fumbling and stumbling. He should go out and say I can't act, I can't dance -- or nothing -- but I really want to be president.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This shortfall makes it unlikely that Clinton nostalgia will automatically benefit Mr. Gore come fall. If anything, the closest heir to Mr. Clinton so far is Mr. Bush. The president indicated as much in his stand-up routine, when he joked that the Texas governor had hijacked his old Dick Morris campaign strategy of ''moving toward the political center, distancing himself from his own party [and] stealing ideas from the other party.'' The parallels don't end there, or with the unsubstantiated drug rumors that have stalked both men without ever denting their political fortunes.

  In the '92 campaign, Mr. Clinton said that ''the most important thing'' he had accomplished as governor of Arkansas was improving education -- a claim no more borne out by Arkansas's dismal rankings in students' test scores than are Mr. Bush's hyperbolic claims for Texas. Mr. Bush's ''compassionate conservatism'' -- in which the federal government plays bite-sized roles in helping to feel and soothe Americans' pain -- lifts specific ideas from Mr. Clinton's New Democrat policies. Both men also have in common the repellent trait of advertising their toughness on crime by savage brandishing of the death penalty as governors: Mr. Clinton refused clemency to the brain-damaged Rickey Ray Rector; Mr. Bush denied clemency to Karla Faye Tucker and then mocked her in a Talk magazine interview with Tucker Carlson.

  This isn't to say that Mr. Bush is remotely in the Clinton league as entertainer in chief; no one is. Reading up for his game show on presidents who ''were grossly overweight, got drunk and went to all-night parties,'' Ben Stein ruefully observed, ''Clinton will be the last of the rollicking over-the-top characters for the foreseeable future.''

  Bush Backs Arms Cuts And Antimissile System  Gov. George W. Bush, flanked by prominent figures from four Republican administrations, called for a ''new approach to nuclear security,'' one that includes possible unilateral reductions in American nuclear weapons combined with a robust antimissile defense system. Mr. Bush said he wanted to reduce the size of America's nuclear arsenal to the ''lowest possible number consistent with our national security'' and below the levels called for under the START II treaty with Russia.

 <textdata>
  Asked at a news conference whether that meant he would reduce the nation's nuclear arsenal unilaterally, Mr. Bush said, ''Yes.'' But then he quickly added, ''I would work closely with the Russians to convince them to do the same.'' And he said, ''I would never do anything to put our  nation at risk.'' [Excerpts, Page A21.]
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, accompanied his call for nuclear weapons reductions with a full-throated endorsement of a far more expansive  missile defense system than that being explored by the Clinton administration. He said he wanted to examine all options for a global system including ''whether or not a space-based system can work.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''America must build effective missile defenses,'' Mr. Bush said, ''based on the best available options at the earliest possible date. Our missile defense must be designed to protect all 50 states and our friends and allies and deployed forces overseas from missile attacks by rogue nations or accidental launches.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush's lack of experience in foreign policy is one of his biggest political vulnerabilities, and he has been making a concerted drive in recent days to speak out on national security issues.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's appearance today was unlike any event that preceded it in this campaign. In contrast to previous policy speeches, his audience consisted only of several dozen Washington reporters gathered in the National Press Club. His speech was relatively short, and much of his time was devoted to answering questions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To give himself added authority, Mr. Bush spoke while flanked by five prominent experts in national security: Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, Brent Scowcroft, Colin L. Powell and Donald H. Rumsfeld, several of whom voiced support of Mr. Bush's ideas. The result was some strange political symbolism as Mr. Bush called for new thinking for a new post-cold-war era, surrounded by some of the architects of the nation's cold-war arms control treaties.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although President Clinton has signaled his willingness to negotiate further weapons cuts with Russia, Mr. Bush accused the administration of being ''locked in a cold-war mentality'' on arms control. That was virtually the same charge Vice President Al Gore used against Mr. Bush just a few weeks ago. At that time Mr. Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said Mr. Bush was ''stuck in a cold-war mind-set'' and cited his advocacy of a global missile defense system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today, Mr. Gore's aides sharply criticized Mr. Bush, saying his approach to nuclear security was unrealistic, that it would not be accepted by the Russians and that it would would undermine years of arms control agreements.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's advisers pointed to Mr. Bush's opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and said the governor advocates the radical rewriting, if not outright abolition, of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has said he would pull out of the pact if the Russians did not agree to adjust it after ''a reasonable amount of time.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  With his speech, Mr. Bush aligned himself with a group of foreign policy thinkers who have started to ask whether traditional arms control agreements are suited to the post-cold-war era.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet Mr. Bush sidestepped a host of questions today by saying that as president he would order his defense secretary to conduct an assessment of the nuclear force structure and only then decide how many nuclear weapons the nation needed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Pressed on whether he supported the Start III framework, Mr. Bush said he would decide what level of warheads was sufficient only after consultations with his defense secretary and the military.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If Mr. Bush contemplates reducing the nuclear arsenal to less than 2,000 to 2,500 weapons, he could well face resistance from the military.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On Capitol Hill today, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said they opposed reducing the United States nuclear arsenal below those levels, though their words were not aimed at Mr. Bush. They appeared at a hearing called by Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, as a pre-emptive strike against any efforts by the administration to use lower nuclear arms cuts with Russia to win agreement on limited missile defense system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush portrayed his drive for an expansive missile defense system as one that would protect not just the United States but its allies against accidental missile launchings, terrorist strikes or rogue nations. He said that he would share the technology with Europe and Israel and that he might consider sharing it with Russia, depending on ''how Russia behaves.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush insisted that he could afford a robust antimissile defense system along with two other things for which he has called: a $1.3 trillion tax cut and billions of new dollars in spending on social programs and additional tax incentives. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that it would cost $60 billion to build a land-based system that would include 250 missile interceptors at two sites.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is interested in a missile defense system far more wide ranging than one Mr. Clinton is examining. Ms. Rice said in an interview that he wants to look at ''all options'' including defense from land, from sea or from space.

  Leon Fuerth, the national security adviser to Mr. Gore, argued today that the more limited system being examined by the Clinton administration could be in place by 2005 in time to face a possible threat from North Korea. He said Mr. Bush's effort to ''tear up all the technology and start all over again'' would set back development and leave the United States vulnerable to rogue states.

  He used 1991 as an example of the kinds of steps he was advocating. That was the year when President George Bush unilaterally took all American strategic bombers off alert status. He also removed American short-range nuclear weapons from Europe and Asia.

  In talking with reporters, Governor Bush said he had consulted with Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Shultz and the others with him on the policy he was advocating. And he said all had agreed to advise him in the future. But most attention focused on Mr. Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Persian gulf war of 1991 and who many Republicans would like to see as a vice-presidential candidate. Mr. Powell has said he is not interested in the job. ''The answer's well known,'' he said today. ''I won't take any time away from the governor to belabor you with'' being nominated as vice president.

  Asked whether he had discussed with Mr. Powell the possibility of a  Cabinet post like secretary of state, Mr. Bush shot back to reporters, ''I'm not going to tell you what I talk to him about.''

  ACCURACY -- Governors in large states seeking higher office have to expect to run on their records, and the environment is an issue on which Democrats believe Mr. Bush is highly vulnerable; Vice President Al Gore regularly decries Mr. Bush's stewardship of a state that ranks in several categories as one of the nation's most polluted. Texas's vast and influential oil and chemical industries have yielded the state riches but also some pollution problems. Houston is among the nation's most smoggy cities, and the release of toxins into waterways is a growing problem. But just as the Sierra Club quotes from federal reports that describe Texas's environmental flaws, Mr. Bush can cite some advancements, such as an initiative to reduce emissions from older plants and the expansion of a program begun by his predecessor, Ann W. Richards, a Democrat, to reward companies that cut their toxic waste by half.

  SCORECARD -- The environmental advocacy group is spending $250,000 to run this commercial in four Midwestern and border states: Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan and, next week, Ohio, all of which are considered potentially decisive in the fall campaign. The Sierra Club started its advertising blitz two months before the New Hampshire primary and has emerged as one of the most active and visible special-interest groups of the campaign on television. It is planning to spend $8 million to raise public awareness of environmental issues. Mr. Bush's efforts to counter the club's assertions have been fairly low key, limited to events like a news conference in April in which he unveiled a plan to hasten the cleanup of abandoned industrial sites.

  GORE LEADS IN HOLLYWOOD MONEY -- Entertainment industry donors, historically more Democratic than Republican, give Vice President Al Gore more campaign money than they give Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Through March 30 in the current election cycle, Mr. Gore collected $858,865 from executives and others employed by television, movie and music companies, while Mr. Bush brought in $661,877, according to the latest figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan study group in Washington. Over all, Mr. Bush has a 2-to-1 lead in fund-raising, $84 million to $36 million, not including federal matching funds. The entertainment industry is Mr. Gore's fifth-largest campaign contributor; it is No. 20 on the Bush list.

  ''I stood against the efforts of the two previous administrations to pressure Israel to take stands against its own view of what was in Israel's best interest,'' Mr. Gore said to warm applause.

  Mr. Gore made his remarks a day after Governor Bush, the likely Republican nominee for president, used a speech before the same organization to accuse the Clinton administration of trying ''to make Israel conform to its own plans and timetables.'' The governor also asserted that the administration had taken sides in the most recent Israeli election by supporting Ehud Barak in his victorious campaign over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''When we took office almost eight year ago, President Clinton and I decided that the United States needed to chart a new course with regard to the Middle East peace process,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Unlike our immediate predecessors, we chose to get intimately involved.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And he reminded the crowd of President Bush's failure to oust  President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in  the Persian Gulf war of 1991. ''You know as well as I know that as long as Saddam Hussein stays in power, there can be no comprehensive peace for the people of Israel or the people of the Middle East,'' Mr. Gore said.

  Mr. Bush contends that private investment accounts would allow taxpayers to take advantage of booming markets and help stabilize the system, which is projected to become insolvent in 2037. But Mr. Gore argues that privatization, as he calls it, would bankrupt the system.

  Today, Mr. Gore told the 1.4-million-member union, which has endorsed him, that Mr. Bush's plan presented a ''special risk'' for service workers because the government might be forced to increase the retirement age to finance it. Mr. Bush denies that.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I don't care what the actuarial tables say about people living longer, when somebody who is working in hard physical-labor jobs get to the present retirement age, they shouldn't be told they have to keep working until they are 70 years old,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The Bush privatization plan doesn't just open the door to raising the retirement age, it practically rolls out a red carpet for the idea.''

  The event was more a pep rally than a formal address as Mr. Bush spoke for about 20 minutes to House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club, underscoring many of his campaign themes.

  ''Which side is the vice president on?'' Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat, said in an interview. ''He doesn't want to offend anybody.'' Mr. Rangel said that Mr. Gore had called him about the bill but that he was already supporting it and that there was not much point to the conversation.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The service workers' union and its former chief, John Sweeney, who is now president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., have essentially given Mr. Gore a pass on the China bill, but not everyone in the labor movement is feeling so generous.

  The president of the United Auto Workers today offered one of the most blistering assessments of Mr. Gore's actions on behalf of the bill. Mr. Gore has been two-faced, the union president said, and is driving the auto workers into the arms of one of the auto industry's enduring nemesis, Ralph Nader, who is also running for president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He has tried to have it both ways on China,'' an outraged Stephen P. Yokich, president of the 1.3-million-strong auto workers union, said of Mr. Gore in a statement today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''One moment, presidential candidate Gore is telling the labor movement that he believes human rights, workers' rights, and environmental protections should be included in core trade agreements; the next, Vice President Gore is holding hands with the profiteers of the world and singing the praises'' of the trade agreement and ''lobbying'' for it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, criticism from a putative ally goes a long way toward explaining Mr. Gore's reluctance to take a more visible role in promoting the trade agreement. The Gore campaign has hoped that the vice president could use the issue to convey that he is not beholden to labor and that he is willing to break with an important constituency over principle.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000

 <textdata>
  ''I just want to tell you forthrightly I don't share your views on this particular issue,'' Mr. Gore said to several thousand service workers today.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has said numerous times that he supports the trade agreement, and he took part in a White House pep rally to advance it. He also has said that he has called members of Congress to lobby on behalf of the bill.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He caused consternation at the White House in February after labor leaders said he had indicated that he would negotiate a tougher pact than Mr. Clinton negotiated. Administration officials were worried that Mr. Gore's stance could give political cover to Democrats who opposed the bill. Mr. Gore then wrote to the nation's chief business lobbying group, the National Association of Manufacturers, to reassure it of his support.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000

 <textdata>
  Unlike Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Gore's Republican rival for the presidency, Mr. Gore has not devoted a speech to the single topic of the China bill. When Mr. Bush addressed it last week at a Boeing factory in Everett, Washington, his impassioned remarks gave the appearance that he was more closely allied with President Clinton on this matter than Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000

  Today, Mr. Bush met with Republicans privately on Capitol Hill and reiterated his support for the bill. Members said afterward that he asked those who plan to vote against it to reconsider their vote.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Stephen P. Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, a liberal research organization, said that Mr. Gore's blurry approach raised legitimate questions. But he also suggested that Mr. Gore's posture over the bill has reinforced an impression that the vice president is overly cautious and calculating. ''You feel that Gore really is an internationalist, but for heaven's sake, why doesn't he come out and say it?'' Mr. Hess said. ''Everything has become so calculated.''

  It lacked details and raised, but failed to answer, tantalizing questions. But Gov. George W. Bush's call today for ''a new approach'' to the nation's nuclear arsenal represented what could be, in the view of experts, a significant shift in arms control and post-cold-war relations with Russia.

 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  But in calling for missile defenses not only for the United States but also for its allies, Mr. Bush challenged the longtime orthodoxy of arms control: that prohibiting defenses allowed limits in offenses.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000

 <textdata>
  ''Our mutual security need no longer depend on a nuclear balance of terror,'' Mr. Bush declared, surrounded by members of Republican administrations who once defended some of the very assumptions that he challenged today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many of the proposals outlined by Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, were greeted with striking praise from arms-control experts. In particular, they welcomed his pledge to ask the Pentagon to review its targeting strategies and rethink the number of warheads, which Mr. Bush called ''expensive relics of dead conflicts.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But they warned about the risks in other parts of Mr. Bush's vision. Mr. Bush's seemingly open-ended view of missile defenses, they said, could undercut the benefits of his proposals to reduce the number of weapons and take ''as many weapons as possible'' off ''hair-trigger status.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Bruce G. Blair, president of the Center for Defense Information here and a strong advocate for reducing the alert status of American and Russian forces, welcomed Mr. Bush's remarks. But he said they contained inherent contradictions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Blair said that if the United States proceeded with a significant missile defense system, Russia would feel compelled to keep its forces on alert to preserve their ability to launch an overwhelming counterattack. A heightened Russian posture, he added, would convince the Pentagon that the steps Mr. Bush said he would pursue -- even unilaterally -- would not be possible.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Neither Mr. Bush nor his aides would discuss his proposals in detail, leaving many questions about how -- and whether -- he could bring about a new era of arms control in a Bush presidency. He did not rule out creating a missile defense based at sea or in space, which would prove even more unsettling to the Russians than the limited system the Clinton administration is considering and would certainly require abrogation of the A.B.M. treaty.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush emphasized that he would never make any reductions that the Pentagon did not endorse, but it has long been the Pentagon that has resisted deeper reductions in warheads.

  KEYES FIRM ON ABORTION  The abortion issue continues to present potential problems for the Republican Party, with Alan Keyes, a presidential candidate, considering leaving the party if it weakens its stance against abortion. Connie Hair, Mr. Keyes's press secretary, says he will possibly join the Constitution Party and seek its nomination if the Republicans do not retain a strong anti-abortion position in their platform or if Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, picks a running mate who is not anti-abortion. The Constitution Party is strongly anti-abortion. Ms. Hair made her comments to USA Today over the weekend, then elaborated on them yesterday. Mr. Keyes has not been heard from much lately. But Ms. Hair emphasized that while Mr. Keyes reserved the right to abandon the Republican Party over the abortion issue, he was for the moment still a candidate for the Republican nomination, had delegates pledged to him and intended to attend the party convention in Philadelphia. The Constitution Party already has a presidential candidate, Howard Phillips, who said yesterday, ''I am prepared to discuss anything with Alan Keyes, including the possibility of his becoming our candidate for president or vice president, but my present intention is to continue as the presidential nominee.''

  Mrs. Roukema, 70, of Ridgewood, has held her seat for 20 years and is strongest in the more populous Bergen County portion of the district. Her politics reflect the moderate suburban Republican outlook of much of northern Bergen's commuter population: she is for abortion rights, she resisted some of the harsher aspects of welfare reform, and she sponsored the Family and Medical Leave Act that President Bush vetoed and President Clinton signed. Mrs. Roukema has won middle-of-the-road scores from Congressional watchdog groups on taxation and spending issues, and she reminds her constituents that she is next in line for the chairmanship of the House Banking Committee, if she wins re-election and the Republicans retain control of Congress.

  Mr. Bush did not elaborate. Aides said his comments about a timetable referred to the nine days and nights of tortuous Wye River negotiations on Maryland's Eastern Shore, which committed the Israelis and Palestinians to actions they had promised in previous agreements. The talks restored momentum to the peace process, setting a detailed timetable for Israel's withdrawal from part of the West Bank in three phases.

  Little more than a year ago, Mr. Bush came under criticism for silence on the West's air war in Kosovo. And more than a few critics have questioned how capable he would be, as president, on foreign policy issues.

  Among advisers not directly affiliated with the campaign, Mr. Harding has signaled to Mr. Giuliani that he thinks it might be best for the mayor if he did not run. He has been in a difficult situation from the moment Mr. Giuliani said he wanted the Liberal Party's support. Mr. Harding has seemed inclined to accede to Mr. Giuliani's request, though it could come with a high cost, since Mr. Gore has said he might not take the Liberal Party endorsement if the party backed Mr. Giuliani.

  Nobody is terribly angry, just a little confounded about what to do. ''The last thing I want to do is start up trouble, because I'm a Gore supporter,'' Chris White, 42, who is the editor of the Web site and lives in Manhattan, said in an interview.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000

 <textdata>
  The vice president's office more or less shrugged off the fact that Mr. Gore had not attributed the jokes. ''Like all of us, the vice president, when he hears a funny joke, tells it to others and passes it on,'' said Melissa Ratcliff, a spokeswoman for his office.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. White said the Jewish jokes had been culled from his contributors around the country and posted on his Web site on Feb. 24, 1999. Mr. Gore has apparently used them a couple of times since, but they are by no means part of his regular campaign speeches.

  Democrats clearly hoped that the rallies would mark a sea change in the politics of gun control and an end to the truism that the gun lobby can turn out its vote, while the forces of gun control cannot. Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who attended today's march in Washington, said, in a reference to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee: ''Bush ought to be terrified. Look out there -- that is the face of the soccer mom.''
 </textdata>

  But polls have shown that women are almost evenly divided in their views of how the two presidential candidates handle the gun issue. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll asked, ''Regardless of which candidate you prefer for president, who do you agree with more on the issue of gun control -- Al Gore or George W. Bush?'' Thirty-five percent of the women said they agreed more with Mr. Gore, while 30 percent said they agreed more with Mr. Bush. Among mothers, 33 percent said they agree more with Mr. Bush, 24 percent with Mr. Gore.

  In that regard, many of us -- even some scandalmongers -- draw a line between private life and public conduct. I'm for full disclosure of financial dealings past and present, but what candidates do in their bedrooms is none of our business, and I really don't care if Al Gore or George W. Bush smoked pot or worse in their youth. Both Giuliani and his former flack deny his wife's charge of an affair; in the absence of evidence, we should presume innocence.

  Ms. Hannan-Welch's negative impression of Mr. Gore was echoed to some degree in recent interviews in Chicago with women who said they normally vote Democratic. While most said they also disliked Governor Bush, they were unenthusiastic about the Democratic alternative.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Similar reactions have been suggested in recent national polls. They have found that Mr. Bush is preferred by women, particularly married women and mothers. The results have caused enough concern among Gore supporters that last week representatives of groups like the National Organization for Women met with Mr. Gore to urge him to work harder to reach women.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  In general, the Chicago women interviewed who were sour on Mr. Gore were not reacting to specific issues. Several agreed with his platform, while others said they knew little about his views. Instead, several women said they had a negative gut feeling about him, that he lacked charisma or seemed untrustworthy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By contrast, those women interviewed who supported Mr. Gore generally attributed their approval to his views on issues like abortion, the environment and education, saying that once others understood his positions they would support him, too.

  ''Am I concerned about it? Absolutely,'' said Peter Giangreco, a Gore campaign adviser in Illinois. But, ''if I wasn't concerned about women I'd be freaking out about some other group because that's what we do. All we do is obsess about groups like rural white men over 50 and women with cell phones under 30.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000

 <textdata>
  He and other Gore supporters said it was still early in the campaign and most voters were not paying attention. Mr. Giangreco said most still knew little about Mr. Gore, and that he was at his best speaking directly to voters and in debates ''mano a mano.''

  By and large, the women who were interviewed said their views of President Clinton had no bearing on how they saw Mr. Gore. A few said they wished Mr. Clinton were running again. And those disillusioned by the Monica Lewinsky scandal said they did not view Mr. Gore in that context.

  Jackie Pomarski, 34, a homemaker from a Democratic working-class Southwest Chicago neighborhood, said Mr. Gore ''will say whatever he needs to say to please the crowd. He's kind of a snake in the grass. When he talks I feel like he always has a big smirk on his face.''

  ''I don't think that Gore has the right stuff for the presidency,'' said Irene Cohen, a Clinton supporter in her 60's. ''I don't think he has the ability, I don't think he's smart enough, I don't think he presents himself to the public well enough.''
 </textdata>

  Mrs. Pomarski, who opposes abortion, said that Mr. Gore flip-flopped on the issue. He opposed federal financing of abortion early in his Congressional career, but has supported abortion rights for many years. She said she liked his positions on Northern Ireland and on education.

  Nearly all the women interviewed were equally critical of Mr. Bush and said they could not see voting for him. Mrs. Pomarski, for example, called the Texas governor ''sinister.'' And Mrs. Cohen said, ''I don't think either one of them is really capable. If I had to go to the polls right now, I'd vote for Mickey Mouse.''

  Some Gore strategists expressed respect, albeit grudging, for Mr. Bush's stewardship of his organization, one that has been run entirely out of Austin, Tex., by a staff largely untested in national campaigns. And the strategists said they regretted that the Gore campaign for weeks allowed itself to become enveloped in the case of Elian Gonzalez.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But mostly, they said, the vice president is suffering because Mr. Bush has moved more aggressively to lay out his agenda, and the public has not had a chance to compare his positions with Mr. Gore's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Tony Coelho, the Gore campaign chairman, said in an interview here that while Mr. Gore had distanced himself months earlier from the Clinton administration on the Gonzalez matter, the campaign should have more effectively conveyed that when Mr. Gore spoke out in March, saying the Cuban boy should be granted permanent residency status.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, even the most negative Gore advisers insisted that they were not alarmed, and that with Election Day nearly six months away, there was time for the campaign to right itself. But their biggest fear, they said, was that if Mr. Gore does not move quickly to refine his message, impressions may be locked in place.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000

 <textdata>
  The campaign's difficulties have been magnified by several recent opinion polls that show Mr. Gore trailing Mr. Bush in virtually every demographic category. Many surveys have found that Mr. Bush is leading Mr. Gore among almost every age and income group nationally except for elderly voters; Mr. Bush has had more success drawing independents and, strikingly, he is even outperforming Mr. Gore among married women, traditionally a more Democratic constituency. In several important states that are usually reliably Democratic -- like Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin -- surveys show that the vice president faces unusually tight competition.

  Privately, some Gore advisers said they worried that Republicans had rallied around Mr. Bush far more eagerly than Democrats around Mr. Gore because they were so determined to retake the White House.

  But publicly, many Gore aides insisted it was too early to fret.

  ''You know what I keep telling my friends who are panicking over polls?'' asked Donna Brazile, the Gore campaign manager. ''That it's a summertime passion in Washington, D.C.'' Seeking to reassure Democrats, she added: ''The Republican Party cannot win from the right so they are trying to dance and shuffle to the middle. Well, the middle is ours. It's occupied.''

  Carter Eskew, a top Gore strategist, said of Mr. Bush: ''The race has settled somewhat in his favor, but it is still a very close race. In terms of what Bush is doing, there's some good camouflage going on. It reflects a wearing off of some of the damage done to Bush in the primaries. But eventually voters will see through it.''

  Acknowledging the faltering poll numbers, Mr. Coelho said: ''I am cognizant of the fact that with women we need to be better by the time November comes. The thing is that most of these women don't understand where George Bush is on a lot of these issues. The pollsters say the public is a lot more interested in vacations right now.'' But, he added, ''We have a challenge between here and November.''

  One top Gore aide was not as upbeat. ''We went into a lull after the primaries and the Bush campaign went right on script,'' the aide said. ''Gore obviously has to step up his game and differentiate himself. We have to sharpen our focus. We have not focused on the winning formula.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The belief that Mr. Gore needs to jump-start his operation has sparked internal debate over whether his strategy of ridiculing Mr. Bush's proposals, while successful in the primaries against former Senator Bill Bradley, threaten to make the vice president appear too harsh. Mr. Coelho, for his part, insisted that Mr. Gore would not shrink from his aggressive tone. ''The public wants somebody who will fight,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Coelho said, repeatedly, that the press should not dwell on the vice president's recent dips in the polls, but on how he is still in far better shape than six months ago, when Mr. Bush was clobbering him by wide margins. Arguing that Mr. Gore was suffering in part because of expectations, he said: ''We came out of our primary higher than we should have. He came out of his primary lower than he should have.''

  Members of the Gore high command were quick to note that Bill Clinton was way down in the polls at this point in 1992 -- and won the election. And at this point in 1988, Michael S. Dukakis basked in a comfortable lead, only to lose.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Already, the 2000 campaign has been remarkable for the many reversals of fortune. A year ago, Mr. Gore did not even view Mr. Bradley as a threat. By the fall, Mr. Bradley's success forced Mr. Gore to retool his campaign. And by the end of the primaries, Mr. Gore appeared to be more potent than Mr. Bush, who was severely wounded after a contentious scrimmage with Senator John McCain in which he made stark appeals to the right that many Democrats said would haunt him.

  Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said his campaign was moving forward with a general election strategy that had long been in place but was interrupted by the primaries. He said the Gore campaign's drive to undermine Mr. Bush's experience would fail because voters ''recognize that Bush has crossed the threshold of experience.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We've had seven good weeks,'' Mr. Rove said. ''With the lights turned back on and the arena flooded with sunlight, Bush has essentially returned to where he was in December and Gore has returned to where he was.''
 </textdata>

  Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said: ''Bush's charm offensive has been quite effective and the challenge for Gore is to get the race re-engaged as quickly as he can. We're in the best period for Bush. He's not forced to operate under pressure or in the heat of the battle. In those circumstances he delivers a plausible and often appealing performance. Gore is at his best in the heat of battle.''

  McCAIN RESPONDS TO SUPPORTERS ABOUT BUSH -- Supporters of Senator John McCain of Arizona are inundating him with hundreds of e-mail messages and telephone calls complaining about his endorsement of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. He has responded with an e-mail message of his own, sent to 120,000 supporters on his campaign list, that recalled that he had promised at the start of his campaign to support the eventual Republican nominee and that he always makes good on his promises. In any event, the message continued, Mr. Bush is now ''our best hope'' to oust the Democrats from the White House. ''To those who I have disappointed,'' Mr. McCain wrote, ''let me simply reiterate that I will never give up my fight for real government reform.'' He and the Texas governor, he said, still have ''a few principled disagreements,'' but he did not elaborate. McCain aides said the senator expected complaints about his endorsement but went ahead because breaking a promise would not only have tarnished his straight-talking image but also have made him appear a poor loser and a less-than-faithful Republican, should he ever seek the presidency again.

  BUSH COMMENTS ON 2 POSSIBLE RUNNING MATES -- When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was asked about vice-presidential candidates in an interview with the Lifetime women's cable channel yesterday, he had notably different reactions to two names, suggesting that he was concerned about appearing too open to the idea of a running mate who strongly supports abortion rights. Asked if Elizabeth Dole, an opponent of abortion, was on his list, he said that she was and then praised her as ''a good friend of mine who has had a great career.'' But when asked about Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who supports abortion rights and whose selection would undoubtedly provoke many religious conservatives, Mr. Bush's response seemed conspicuously restrained. ''There's a lot of people on the list,'' he said.

  ANOTHER SURVEY SHOWS A STRONG BUSH LEAD -- For the second time this week, a national presidential preference poll has Gov. George W. Bush leading Vice President Al Gore by at least half a dozen percentage points. The newest survey, released yesterday by the Voter.com group, puts Mr. Bush ahead by 48 percent to 42 percent. A poll released on Wednesday by The Los Angeles Times had Mr. Bush ahead by eight percentage points. Like the Times poll, the Voter.com poll found Mr. Bush now pulling about as much of the female vote as Mr. Gore, though that voting segment has traditionally leaned heavily to Democrats. Mr. Bush continues to lead among men, and he has moved ahead in the struggle for independents, a toss-up earlier. The Voter.com poll also found Mr. Bush leading among Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and also found that half of all voters had grown pessimistic about the state of the nation and its direction, despite the strong economy. Asked to rank top issues for Congress, voters most often mentioned ''restoring moral values,'' followed by education. They said Republicans would be best at restoring moral values -- 6 in 10 disapproved of President Clinton ''as a person'' -- but believed Democrats would do more for education. The poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters from May 1 to May 3 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

  GORE MAKES MOST OF WASHINGTON CONNECTIONS -- Many are the perks of being vice president, particularly when you are running for president. Al Gore demonstrated that anew this week, first by handing out what his office called ''deliverables'' -- more than $25 million in grants to expand tourism and businesses in the financially struggling Mississippi Delta -- and then by announcing ''improvements'' in veterans' education benefits worth $1.2 billion over five years. (Never mind that the money will come from savings in other veterans' programs.) Mr. Gore boasted that the improvements were ''the single largest increase in veterans' education benefits'' in more than 15 years. Gov. George W. Bush called Mr. Gore hypocritical because the Clinton administration had earlier proposed sharp cuts in veterans' benefits.

  Union Warns Gore on China  George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America, said organized labor's support for Vice President Al Gore could be hurt by his recent lobbying for the China trade legislation.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, Vice President Al Gore has withdrawn his support for the proposal. The president has shelved it, citing a lack of support in Congress. But Mr. Clinton's spokesman said earlier this month that the president still supported the concept.

  The panel, whose third member is Judge Joel F. Dubina, who was appointed by President George Bush and is considered a moderate, has several options, legal experts and lawyers for both sides say. It could rule that immigration officials were correct in denying the boy an asylum hearing based on his age, even though immigration laws guarantee an asylum hearing for ''any alien.''

  Gun control looked like a tailor-made issue that Al Gore and the Democrats could hit out of the park. In post-Columbine America, George W. Bush seemed very vulnerable, having signed a conceal-and-carry law in Texas, and having been identified by the unpopular National Rifle Association as being a potentially ''friendly'' president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet, that's not what the polls are showing. Most surveys have found about equal levels of confidence in the two candidates on gun control. And a recent Gallup poll even found a 43 percent to 37 percent plurality thinking Mr. Bush would do the better job on this issue. Two factors account for this unexpected result.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Politically, voters who take a strong pro-control position overwhelmingly favor Mr. Gore on this issue, while those who hold the opposite point of view think Mr. Bush best represents them. But voters with a mixed or moderate position tend to have more confidence in Mr. Bush than in Mr. Gore, according to Pew Research Center surveys. The judgments of the ''moderates'' at this point probably have less to do with knowledge of what the candidates believe about specific controls and rest more on hunches about them personally.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A second component of this is gender, one of the most important prisms in this campaign, especially when it comes to guns. Men have more confidence in Mr. Bush and women more faith in Mr. Gore to represent their views.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  How, and if, the issue affects voter decisions will hinge on the outcome of the campaigns for and against gun control. Can the likes of a million moms do what the N.R.A. has done for years -- mold single-issue voters?  Can Mr. Bush hold the middle on this issue while hanging onto the Second Amendment advocates? Can Mr. Gore effectively draw in more female supporters who favor controls without further alienating men who have less commitment to this cause?

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said the vice president is sympathetic to the Steelworkers' concerns and plans to continue working with the labor movement on a range of issues that affect working families. ''At the same time, he's been very clear about his position on this issue from the day he was endorsed by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last October,'' Mr. Hattaway said. ''He believes the agreement is good for workers and good for the economy.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Becker said he believed that the China bill would have a far more difficult chance of gaining House approval if Mr. Gore were not lobbying for it. ''This is a pretty close vote, and if he makes the difference in this, and we lose, I think there'll be a hell of a price to pay,'' Mr. Becker said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention last October, he said, many labor leaders felt more confident about endorsing Mr. Gore after he promised, if elected, to place more emphasis on worker rights in negotiating trade agreements than President Clinton has.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Becker voiced a concern that many labor leaders have been murmuring for weeks. Many say they are finding it hard to excite union members to vote for and campaign for Mr. Gore when he is battling them on labor's No. 1 legislative issue.

 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  So when Mr. Gore stumps for gun control, as he often does these days, many Democrats here, particularly men, squirm. To them, the issue is a divisive headache that drives their friends and neighbors into the arms of Mr. Gore's presumed Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a frequent critic of gun control.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I get so frustrated when I hear Al Gore talk about gun control,'' said Jim Rooker, a 57-year-old former pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates who now owns a tavern in Beaver County and is active in the local Democratic Party. ''There isn't any question that he'll lose votes here if he keeps it up.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For Mr. Gore, winning this fall will almost certainly require keeping places like Beaver County solidly in the Democratic column, political analysts say. But therein lies the risk of gun control: While the issue plays well among suburban women, it infuriates many men in places like western Pennsylvania. Mr. Gore already trails Mr. Bush among men by double-digit margins, recent polls show.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But to the chagrin of Democrats like Mr. Stupak, Mr. Gore supports gun control proposals that go well beyond simple safety measures like trigger locks. He would require states to create photo licenses for buyers of new handguns. He would ban the cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials and limit handgun purchases to one a month. He supports lawsuits by counties and cities against gun makers. And he accuses Mr. Bush of being a pawn of the rifle association.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, by contrast, contends that the federal government should enforce existing gun laws rather than enact new ones, a basic tenet of the N.R.A. As governor, he signed legislation that allows people to carry concealed weapons into churches, among other places, and that prohibits municipalities from directly suing gun makers. Recently, he suggested that he would also sign anti-lawsuit legislation as president.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  [Mr. Bush announced yesterday that he would spend $1 million a year to provide free trigger locks for handgun owners in Texas and would push for a similar national initiative.]
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Bush is in the safety zone on guns for Pennsylvania voters,'' said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Keystone Poll at Millersville University in Pennsylvania. ''I think supporting lawsuits against manufacturers is problematic for Gore in Pennsylvania because it raises the prospect that guns could be outlawed.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What further complicates the issue for Mr. Gore is that there are many places like Beaver County in the necklace of northern states that Democratic strategists say he needs to win, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan. In recent visits to those states, he has tended to avoid mentioning his positions on gun control.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore and Bill Clinton won those states in 1992, when the economy dwarfed all other issues, and in 1996, when the race was a rout. But this year's contest is expected to be close, meaning gun control could emerge as a significant factor. And history has shown the N.R.A. to be better at mobilizing its voters than gun control proponents have been at energizing theirs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Unlike Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush has said little on gun control except when pressed by reporters, apparently concerned that the issue poses risks for him, as well. Clearly, gun control is widely supported not only in Democratic cities but also many Republican suburbs. And it is popular in California, the largest state, and New Jersey, an important swing state.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the greatest risk for Mr. Bush on gun control is among women. Most polls show that women, by significantly higher margins than men, favor gun control and distrust the N.R.A. The higher the income and education level, the more supportive women are of restrictions on guns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''They are too powerful,'' she said. Asked if she might vote against a politician, including Mr. Bush, based solely on his gun control record, she said, ''Yes.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, chances are good that Mr. Gore will carry Beaver County. But the question is whether he can win it with enough votes to offset Mr. Bush's gains in less Democratic districts. Gun control is likely to be a factor in determining that level of enthusiasm.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Take Dominic DeMarco, a 65-year-old retiree from the Beaver Falls area. Mr. DeMarco is a fan of President Clinton, and thinks Mr. Gore should be given the chance to continue current policies. But do not get him started on gun control.

  There are 4.9 million Democrats and 3 million Republicans registered to vote in New York State. Republican candidates cannot win if their ideology undermines their appeal to moderate voters.

  John Mason of Nevada even argued that the more drawn-out schedule would lead to nicer campaigns. Knowing that the process this year would effectively be over by March 7, Mr. Mason said, Mr. Bush and his main rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, had an incentive to try for ''a death stroke'' against each other.

  GORE LEADS CASH PARADE -- Vice President Al Gore continues to pull in the cash for his party. This week he raised $2.4 million for the Democratic National Committee at six dinners. That brings the total that he has raised for the party since the end of March to $15.8 million, not including the $5 million he helped raise with President Clinton in Hollywood ($2.8 million) and New York ($2.2 million). The events this week included two dinners each, back to back, in Manhattan, Dallas and Los Angeles. Next up is a fund-raiser for the party on May 24 in Washington, where the host, Terry McAuliffe, has promised a record-breaking single-night haul of more than $21 million.

  BUSH HONING FOREIGN POLICY SKILLS -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, ever eager to burnish his foreign policy credentials in the presidential campaign, plans to attend a conference of American and Mexican governors from border states next month in Sacramento. The event is being organized by Gov. Gray Davis of California, a Democrat who is an ally of Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Bush's expected rival in the presidential race. Governors Bush, Gray and Jane Dee Hull, an Arizona Republican, will meet on June 1 and June 2 with their counterparts from six Mexican border states. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Mindy Tucker, said yesterday that the agenda included education, economic development and the environment. Last month, Mr. Bush met with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico at the dedication of the eight-lane, $128 million World Trade Bridge in Nuevo Laredo, just over the border from Texas.

You know, any family that's been in that kind of situation knows that doctors sometimes have experience that could be brought to bear usefully. You know, there are so many different situations, I think that states ought to deal with that on their own.''

  Local Democrats have been urging Mr. Gore to take a leadership role on some of these polarizing local matters. He was greeted today by a front-page article in The Oregonian in which the governor, John Kitzhaber, who supported Mr. Gore's opponent, former Senator Bill Bradley, in the Democratic presidential primaries, said he did not understand why Mr. Gore had not spoken out on the salmon issue.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The article also said Gore advisers were insistent that the vice president would not speak out on the matter because he wanted to focus attention on Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Before his speech on Social Security, Mr. Gore read a statement about salmon, criticizing his Republican opponent's position on the issue, but saying that his own mind was not made up.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''Unfortunately, Gov. George W. Bush has prejudged the outcome,'' Mr. Gore said in the statement he read to about 200 people, referring to Mr. Bush's statement last year that he would oppose any effort to breach the dams.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  ''I feel it is irresponsible to make a decision or draw a conclusion without consulting all of the parties involved and without utilizing hard science,'' Mr. Gore said.

 <textdata>
  Bob Applegate, a spokesman for Governor Kitzhaber, said he believed that the statement was ''extremely helpful'' and he praised Mr. Gore for suggesting he would take a leadership role in helping to resolve the matter.

  George W. Bush announced today that he would spend $1 million a year as governor of Texas to provide free trigger locks for handgun owners in the state and would push for a similar national initiative, at a cost of $65 million a year, if he was elected president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although Mr. Bush had not previously demonstrated much enthusiasm for a government role in promoting trigger locks and had stressed that they were not a panacea for gun violence, he presented his new approach as a way ''to be common-sensical about how we deal with gun safety.''

  ''Like them, I'm concerned about gun violence in our society,'' Mr. Bush said this morning in an appearance on the NBC News television program ''Today.'' The appearance was sought and arranged by his aides with the knowledge that President Clinton would be talking about gun control today on ''Good Morning America,'' on ABC.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The president used his appearance on ''Good Morning America'' to express skepticism about Mr. Bush's announcement, and reiterated assertions by himself and Vice President Al Gore that the governor is a longtime friend of the National Rifle Association who is merely engaging in  a political makeover.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000

 <textdata>
  ''You have to understand what's going on here,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''There was a report in the newspaper last week that a lobbyist from the N.R.A. said they would have an office in the White House if Governor Bush was elected.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Clinton was referring to a snippet of videotape, released as a television commercial by the advocacy group Handgun Control, in which Kayne Robinson, the N.R.A.'s first vice president and also Iowa Republican chairman, made that boast in a closed meeting with other members of the association in February. Mr. Bush has dismissed Mr. Robinson's remark as untrue, and did so again today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000

 <textdata>
  The dueling comments by Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton were among the many competing messages today as the Million Mom March approached. Television news programs were crowded with appeals from advocates on both sides of the issue.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's announcement about trigger locks marked the latest step in a striking evolution of his position on them. It also suggested an awareness of gun control's potential as a potent issue in the 2000 elections and a concern with Mr. Gore's ability to portray the governor as an opponent of sensible restrictions on firearms.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore and his aides consistently draw attention to certain aspects of Mr. Bush's record on guns, most notably a 1995 law permitting Texans with proper training and licenses to carry concealed handguns. Mr. Bush also signed into law last year a measure making it extremely difficult for Texas cities and counties to sue gun manufacturers, and he has indicated support for similar legislation on the federal level.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As for weapons and child safety, Mr. Bush did support a 1995 Texas law that held parents criminally liable if their firearms ended up in the hands of children and caused injury as a result. But as recently as last year, he said he opposed the mandatory sale of trigger locks or other child safety devices with handguns and supported voluntary measures instead.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides said today that his plan to distribute free trigger locks was consistent with his belief that it would be most effective and plausible to encourage voluntary use of them. The Texas program, in which gun owners will be able to obtain the locks at local police and fire stations, is to be financed by $5 million over five years in discretionary spending by the governor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Bush proposed that the federal government make $325 million in matching funds available over five years for state and local governments that adopt similar programs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although the drumbeat for enhanced gun control has grown louder and Mr. Gore supports a wider array of new measures than Mr. Bush, it is unclear who holds the political advantage. Several public opinion polls in recent months suggested that more Americans trusted Mr. Bush to handle the issue correctly than trusted Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But a new ABC News poll, conducted just after the N.R.A. official's comments about a Bush White House became public last week, showed Mr. Gore with an edge, 46 percent to 38 percent. That telephone survey, of 1,068 adults interviewed from Sunday though Wednesday, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

  Increasing access to clean needles decreases the incidence of blood-borne infection without creating new drug use. Needle exchange and pharmacy sales work.

  As for Mr. Gore, any legislator or federal policy official is acquainted with a range of issues. But beyond casting votes in Congress, he does not appear ever to have occupied a position, public or private, where the ''buck stops.''

  But here in Texas, which under Mr. Bush has executed more people than any other state, some of the officials who administer the death penalty, reviewing the case records, considering inmates' appeals and weighing final pleas for clemency, are not so sanguine. These officials, who support Mr. Bush's presidential candidacy and believe in the death penalty, said in interviews that they believed Texas ran the risk of executing an innocent person.
 </textdata>

  ''I believe in the death penalty and I don't want to do anything that will cause George Bush to lose the election,'' said Paddy Lann Burwell, a retired Exxon manager who was appointed by the governor two years ago to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, which reviews all clemency requests in capital cases and makes recommendations to the governor. Still, in an interview at his cattle ranch outside Westhof, south of Austin, Mr. Burwell voiced concerns about the fairness of the state's judicial system, particularly several cases in which he said prosecutors seemed more concerned with scoring victories, in the form of capital convictions, than with justice.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Cynthia Tauss, who has studied law, is also on the board. She said she ''cried all day'' after Texas executed Mr. Farris. ''I wasn't sure he should have been given the death penalty,'' she said. ''That's why I voted to commute.'' A majority of the 18-member board would have to have voted for clemency in order to make a recommendation of it to Mr. Bush.

  Charles Baird, a judge on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals until 1998, was in Washington this week to announce the formation of a national committee to prevent wrongful executions. Asked whether he agreed with Mr. Bush that no one had been wrongfully executed under his watch, Mr. Baird said:  ''Everyone in Texas hopes and prays that that's the case. I do not share his view.'' For such certainty to exist, he added, ''You have to take the position that this very fallible system has worked flawlessly.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000

 <textdata>
  But a close look by The New York Times at a half dozen executions carried out during Governor Bush's tenure -- including interviews with jurors, prosecutors, judges, witnesses and co-defendants still on death row -- makes clear that a legal and judicial system rife with these conditions creates, at the very least, the risk of an innocent person being sent to death row. Although most of the officials interviewed said they believed that the executed men were guilty, they questioned aspects of the legal system that sent them to their deaths.
 </textdata>

  Across the country there have been 87 exonerations in the last 27 years, more than a third of them in the last seven years. These cases have prompted a growing national concern over executions. In January, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who supports the death penalty, announced a moratorium on executions while a thorough review is conducted of the state's criminal justice system. Mr. Ryan, who is Mr. Bush's state campaign chairman, described his state's system, where 13 death row inmates have been exonerated since 1987, 11 of them since 1994, as ''fraught with error.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the last year, 13 states have had bills pending that would have halted executions. Asked on ''Meet the Press'' if he would consider following the lead of Governor Ryan, Mr. Bush said he would not. Asked why he thought Mr. Ryan had taken the action, Mr. Bush answered: ''Maybe they've had some problems in their courts. Maybe they've had some faulty judgments.''
 </textdata>

  Then, in an unusual move, seven members of the state parole board voted for clemency, but 10 opposed it and one abstained. Mr. Farris was executed in January 1999. During Mr. Bush's tenure, the parole board has granted clemency to only one death row inmate, according to the board's statistics; as of the end of April, it had rejected 68 clemency petitions.

  Since George W. Bush took office in 1995, Texas has put to death more than twice as many people as the next state, Virginia, with 52, and more than all the executions put together in the next four states -- Missouri with 31, Oklahoma with 21, South Carolina with 20 and Arizona with 18. Texas has 12 executions scheduled for May and June. The state has 462 people on death row, second only to California, with 561 death row inmates (California, in contrast, has executed 8 people). Ann W. Richards, the liberal Democratic governor who preceded Mr. Bush, presided over the executions of a then-record 50 death row inmates.

  Last year, Governor Bush vetoed a modest indigent defense bill that its backers said would have improved the quality of representation in criminal cases. It would have given counties the authority to set up public defender offices, which only a handful now have, and curbed the power of judges to appoint their friends and campaign contributors to represent indigents. For a small-town practitioner, these appointments can be a lucrative source of income; to remain in the good graces of the judges who dole them out, some lawyers feel bound to move cases quickly. The bill would also have required that a lawyer be appointed within 20 days after a person is arraigned. There is no limit now.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Explaining his veto at the time, Mr. Bush said, among other things, that the bill would not improve legal counsel for the poor. Asked about the bill on ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Bush said he could not remember it, though he insisted that he was ''for public defenders.''

  This emphasis on speed hurt Jerry Lee Hogue. Although there was strong evidence, including two eyewitnesses, that he had committed the arson-murder for which he was convicted, on the eve of his scheduled execution nearly 20 years later a law enforcement official had gnawing doubts. The official, Joseph Stewart, an arson investigator in Wichita Falls, arrested a man for a different arson who it turned out had been at the arson for which Mr. Hogue had been convicted. The arsons seemed disturbingly similar, Mr. Stewart said in an interview, and he called Governor Bush's office several times, pleading for a reprieve of 30 days in order to pursue the new evidence.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000

 <textdata>
  ''I'm not a defense lawyer, I'm a Texas peace officer,'' said Mr. Stewart, a death penalty supporter who has voted for Mr. Bush and has been in law enforcement since he was 21. For this reason he thought Governor Bush would listen to him. He was wrong.

  ''The board would not have to sacrifice its conservative ideology to carry out its duties in a more fair and accurate fashion,'' the judge ruled. The judge said it was up to the Texas Legislature to make any changes. Governor Bush said he saw no need for a change.

  Perhaps because the rate of clemency is so low, lawyers may not always put their full energies into applying for it, said a former lawyer in the governor's general counsel office from 1989 to 1998, Jim Sallans, who reviewed hundreds of clemency petitions in capital cases. He said he ''supports the way Governor Bush handles clemency in capital cases,'' and he said he had no doubt that all those executed under the governor were guilty.

  Governor Bush, who has never witnessed an execution, weighs all clemency petitions, as well as all other cases set for execution, sometimes several days, or more, before an  execution, sometimes the morning of the lethal injection. His powers to act are limited by the recommendations of the parole board, except that he may grant a 30-day reprieve on his own. He has never done so.

(The campaign contributions were not down the drain after all, thank you, Jesus.) Yet the winner's top strategist, Karl Rove, moved uncomfortably through the victory bash at the Four Seasons in Austin that evening. ''The king has arrived!'' someone shouted at Rove, and the king winced. ''This is because of you,'' said a woman who dribbled her drink on his jacket as she hugged him. When Michael Levy, the publisher of Texas Monthly, knelt before him with a flourish and pretended to kiss his ring, Rove turned around, bent over at the waist and hiked up his jacket. As in, ''Kiss this.''

  It was Rove who hatched the whole concept of the Bush campaign, starting with the parade of Republicans who showed up in Austin begging the governor to run. But after Bush lost to Senator John McCain in New Hampshire and later in Michigan, there was widespread panic among campaign contributors and plenty of grousing from Daddy Bush's old team: what did this Rove really know about running a national campaign? The question hasn't gone away either. In his own party, he is seen by many as both too inexperienced and too smitten by his candidate to be of much use. Yet the story here is not ''Jethro Runs a Presidential Campaign.'' If George W. Bush is not elected president, it won't be because Karl Rove isn't tough enough. And he is not in love.

  And when I brought up the talk about his experience being too provincial, his response again was pretty macho: ''No, I haven't run a national campaign, but who has? Jim Baker?'' This he said as if being James Baker, who reluctantly ran President Bush's 1992 campaign, is maybe not such a good thing. Rove said he would, of course, be bringing in reinforcements, and already, a number of better-known operatives, including Haley Barbour and Mary Matalin, have been hired to lend advice. Yet Rove could not help adding, sneeringly: ''But do you repopulate the campaign with people from 1908? No!''

  There are other concerns about Rove: he cannot hope to maintain airtight message control -- the hallmark of his earlier campaigns, including W.'s gubernatorial runs -- in the circus atmosphere of a presidential race. And quite possibly, Rove's arrogance and his tendency to take politics personally are not the ideal check on Bush's arrogance and tendency to take politics personally. But Republicans can stop worrying that Karl Rove is too down-home, laid-back, blissed out or otherwise insufficiently aggressive for the job.

  At one point during that big evening at the Four Seasons, Rove retreated to a hotel suite upstairs to crunch numbers and monitor TV chat. He phoned the Bush campaign's communications director, Karen Hughes, to tell her what to say on the air. (Earlier, he had also told her what to tell Bush to say.) Then he disappeared into the bathroom with his cell phone to take a call from Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Rove and his boss had been on the phone throughout the day, and from his office at Bush central that afternoon, he gave Bush the good news from the exit polls, taking special pleasure in the McCain campaign ''meltdown,'' as he called it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's not pretty, they say,'' he told Bush on the phone. ''It's not pretty how the numbers are being received. He's going to Arizona, and the scuttlebutt is he's going to his cabin and nobody thinks he can continue. Yeah, recriminations, finger-pointing. No, over there. Oh, big time. It's unbelievable.'' They dished McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, or at least Rove did: ''Yeah, he is a bad guy. This guy was a lobbyist for Imelda Marcos and General Abacha of Nigeria! Just the consummate inside-D.C. thug. He needs adult supervision.'' (Davis's firm, though not Davis himself, did some work for Marcos and for Nigeria when Abacha was in power.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Just as Rove finished talking to Bush from the hotel bathroom that evening, boisterous, good-natured Karen Hughes burst into the suite, and Rove told her he just wanted to ''get New York over with so we can go home.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They hovered near the TV, and when Bush finally came on CNN, Hughes marveled at how well he was performing. ''He's really gotten good at doing these satellite feeds,'' she said. ''He'd never done any before.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  College was off and on: Rove began at the University of Utah in 1969, thinking of majoring in political science, but after his parents split up during his freshman year, he says, ''I had to start to fend for myself.'' To earn money for school, he worked in a convenience store and was robbed at gunpoint. And he never did get a degree, still a tender spot with him. One thing he seems to like best about Bush, in fact, is that the governor seems to share some of Rove's resentment of Ivy Leaguers, though he is one himself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I guess I'm more cerebral and lack his great people skills,'' Rove said. ''And I'm more of a nerd. Lee was a nerd in high school, but then he learned to play the guitar and talk to girls, and I never did. That's serious.'' They both met George Bush in that job, of course, and his son George W. too. And both Rove and Atwater ended up going to work for the elder Bush -- Rove down in Texas, where he has been ever since.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When I asked people who have worked with Rove in Texas what makes a classic ''Karl campaign,'' they all used the same word: control. He picks a few campaign themes and goes to great pains to keep his candidates on message. A year before Bush first ran for governor, against Ann Richards in 1994, he was invited to participate in a little skit being put on by a Republican women's group in Dallas, and Rob Allyn, a Republican consultant who was working on the event, got a call from Rove. ''He said Bush would make fun of himself, his mother or whatever,'' Allyn recalled recently, ''but he would not under any circumstances make fun of Ann Richards and would appear only on that condition.'' Allyn was floored: ''It's a year out! Bush hasn't even said he's running. This is a skit for the faithful. But Karl has decided that they're not going to run against Ann's personality, because she has a great personality, so he's on the phone, all serious.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There are also a lot of stories of Rove's bullying on behalf of Bush. Frank Cahoon, one of the first Republicans ever elected to the Texas House (he is now retired from politics and living in Midland) heard from Rove after Cahoon openly disagreed with some of the appointments Bush made upon being elected governor. He called one Sunday night and went on for an hour, Cahoon recalled: ''Karl was reading me the riot act as a traitor. I said, 'Who cares what some old man out here in the desert thinks?''' Cathie Adams, who heads the Texas Eagle Forum, a conservative antifeminist group, said that after she criticized some of Bush's policies, she got a call from Rove, too: ''You don't cross him unless you want a lot of grief and threats.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A friend of mine in Texas, Anne Marie Kilday, a former colleague at The Dallas Morning News, says Rove called her at home early one morning during Bush's race against Richards. Republicans had been shopping a story about supposed malfeasance by a female state official Kilday covered. According to Kilday, Rove said he was looking over the telephone records of this official, who is a lesbian, and said he found it interesting that there had been a number of calls to Kilday from the official ''at your residence.'' Kilday recalled, ''He said, 'You've just got to be careful about your reputation and what people might think.'''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  The feeling in the Bush camp seems to be that whatever Rove has done has worked pretty well so far; he is fully in charge and likely to remain so. Rove's friend Reggie Bashur, who has worked for Bush in the past, probably summed it up best: ''They're winning, so it's like that old saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''' And Rove himself sounds downright complacent about making the leap onto the national stage. ''It's not much different,'' he said. ''In some ways, it's easier, because there are more places where they haven't heard the same thing'' repeated over and over. Moving into the summer, Rove seems to be relying on classic back-to-the-middle moves, getting Bush talking about health care for the poor, for example.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One piece of good news for Bush is that Rove is not starry-eyed about his man, as is widely believed -- he has enough distance to make cool decisions. There is no question he is wild about Bush as a candidate. But he seems to see Bush as much as a symbol as a man. Once, when I asked him if the Republican takeover in Texas would have been possible without a George W. Bush, he thought about it for a minute, then said, ''If George W. Bush didn't exist, we'd have to find a way to create somebody like him.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000

 <textdata>
  She shook her head. ''I don't think so,'' she said. ''Neither one of them is going to volunteer their deepest feelings. It's a relationship where Bush just tells you how it is. If he's hungry, it's, 'When's dinner?' and if he's tired, it's, 'I'm going to bed.'''

  Bush has often said he loves Rove's loyalty, and there is the fact that Rove sold his business to devote all his energies to him. But how the candidate really feels about his chief handler is difficult to say; he doesn't like to see too many articles about the help and initially didn't want to be quoted in this one about Rove. ''We handed him the phone and he refused -- he said he just wasn't going to do it,'' a Bush aide explained apologetically. ''He doesn't mind you doing staff stories,'' this aide added, though no one had suggested that he did. ''But he doesn't always weigh in.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Finally, the candidate did leave this phone message for me: ''This is Gov. George Bush. I understand you're writing an article on Karl. I've known Karl a long time, since about 1972. I know him as a friend, and I've been in combat with him, political combat, on more than one occasion. I think -- I know -- he's brilliant. He is very witty and fun to be around. He's well read and an all-around good man. Thank you for your interest'' -- long pause -- in Karl.''

  Diamonds may be forever, but fashion faddists who think forever is too long are lusting after rhinestones. After Dolce &amp; Gabbana sent rhinestones twinkling down its spring runway and Chloe used them to dress up retro aviator sunglasses, designers have been putting stones on everything from T-shirts (the one on left, from Studd, is $275 at Language) to cuff links (DieselStyleLab, $80; to order at 212-755-9200). Sonia Rykiel embellishes leather belts with square rhinestones ($315 at Kirna Zabete) and Noir offers suede versions at Calypso ($105 to $130) as well as rhinestone-strewn flip-flops ($60). Language sells ''skin jewelry'' ($35 to $250), rhinestone and glitter appliques in flower shapes by the British hair stylist J. Maskrey. In Los Angeles, Dana Bushkin turned Puma and Adidas sneakers into disco numbers ($120 for baby sizes; $160, adults; to order, 310-474-2526) that she has sold to Pamela Anderson and Sarah Jessica Parker. Why this rage? Sasha Charnin, fashion market director of Allure, who has been rhinestoning Back Street Boys bandanas ($235 at Kirna Zabete), says, ''If you can't be a rock star, you might as well dress like one.''

  Vice President Al Gore puts his emphasis on the national debt held by the public, the $3.5 trillion that the government has borrowed by selling Treasury securities to individual investors, banks, pension funds and foreign governments.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is taking the view that the government's obligations include not just the public debt, but also the special bonds it is issuing to the Social Security system in ever-growing amounts, representing promises to pay retirement benefits in decades ahead. By that accounting, the current $5.6 trillion in total debt will grow inexorably for years to come.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has made paying off the entire public debt by 2013 the centerpiece of his economic agenda. He wants to use excess Social Security revenue -- more than $2 trillion over the next decade -- to do it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore would then channel the interest savings from debt reduction to Social Security, in effect committing trillions of dollars of general tax revenue to keep the system afloat. In that way, he would extend the system's solvency from 2037 to around 2050 without cutting benefits, raising payroll taxes or altering the way Social Security works.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's approach is different. This week he plans to set out a goal of adding private investment accounts to Social Security, a major change that would require hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars over the next decade. The only place to find that money is the Social Security surplus.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To the extent that the surplus is used to finance private accounts, it would not be available to reduce the public debt, a goal in which Mr. Gore sees both economic logic and considerable political appeal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush's team argues that reducing the public debt is not the only way to improve the government's financial condition. Because the private investment accounts would replace part of the government's obligation to pay Social Security benefits in the long run, his approach would in effect reduce the debt, broadly defined.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You'd be improving the government's balance sheet in an even more efficient way,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the former Federal Reserve governor who is Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The scale of any reduction in total debt under Mr. Bush's approach would depend on the amount of money committed to the private accounts, a decision that Mr. Bush says should be made through bipartisan negotiations after he is elected.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush bucks mainstream economic thinking to a degree when he plays down the importance of wiping out the public debt. But at heart, his plan is about transferring some control of retirement finances from the government to individuals -- a most basic conservative value.

  ''It's a response to what's happening in society,'' said John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for AARP, one of the biggest and most effective lobbying groups in the country. ''It's driven by demographics, the economy and technology. There's a growing awareness, particularly of people who are Bush's and Gore's age, that their parent's generation is becoming frail, we don't have support systems that are in very good shape, and the anxiety about your own retirement is on the top of people's minds.''

And while they had different coming-of-age experiences during the 1960's and 1970's -- Mr. Gore was closer to the counterculture than was Mr. Bush, but still by no means a radical -- both are invoking their generational roots as themes in their campaigns and are developing ''responsibility'' as rationales for their candidacies.

  Mr. Bush emphasizes personal responsibility as a direct counterweight to what he perceives as the irresponsibility of President Clinton (the first baby boomer president). The goal of his candidacy, Mr. Bush says, is to restore honor and dignity to the White House.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has emphasized the theme since he began his campaign last June, saying ''My first goal is to usher in the responsibility era -- an era that stands in stark contrast to the last few decades, where our culture has said: If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a problem, blame someone else.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has also used his emphasis on compassion to temper any impression that responsibility means harshness or sacrifice.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This, of course, necessitates presenting Mr. Bush as the ''irresponsible'' alternative, a neat way, learned from President Clinton, of transforming a policy matter into a values judgment. Repeatedly, Mr. Gore casts Mr. Bush's proposals as ''reckless,'' a quality Mr. Gore conjures up with his relentless referencing to Mr. Bush's ''risky tax scheme.'' The contrast between the responsible Mr. Gore and the irresponsible Mr. Bush has fast become the organizing principle of the Gore campaign.

  Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore is using the idea of responsibility to reinforce one of the basic tenets of his party. While Mr. Bush's reference summons family values, Mr. Gore's highlights the Democrats' traditional advantage on preserving entitlement programs. The ''risky tax scheme'' that he invokes is a direct threat to two tenets of Democratic orthodoxy -- Social Security and Medicare -- that baby boomers are now either depending on to help their parents or expecting to receive themselves.

  Novak thinks that a big reason for the party's disarray is that it has succumbed to the illusion that it can govern the country from Capitol Hill. Republicans watched George Mitchell run rings around George Bush and concluded not just that they had landed a dud for a president but that the balance of power had shifted. The result was disaster. The White House is a centralized operation that can shape day-to-day political debate. Capitol Hill is a world of warring chieftains and headless chickens. The unequal battle has left the Republicans thoroughly ''Clintonized'': obsessed with polls and competing to spend more public money than their rivals. The only way that the Republicans can complete the revolution is to retake the White House.

  The repetition probably had the effect Mr. McCain intended: it reduced the term to ridiculousness. Still smarting over the negative turn that the primary campaign -- and some of Mr. Bush's commercials -- had taken, Mr. McCain had for weeks resisted falling into line behind the presumptive Republican nominee. When he finally did so last week, saying Mr. Bush had the ''vision, knowledge and expertise'' to be president -- and that he himself had no interest in being Mr. Bush's vice president -- there was a tight, grudging quality to the event.

  Fortunately for the gun control side, N.R.A. leaders have a tendency to say offensive things that undermine their organizational and monetary advantages. In March the group's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, suggested that President Clinton was ''willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his political agenda.'' The recent boast by the N.R.A.'s first vice president, Kayne Robinson, that the N.R.A. would have an office in George W. Bush's White House was not a whole lot smarter.

  The occasion cements the president's legacy as the most prodigious political fund-raiser ever. Democratic fund-raisers and the White House estimate that Mr. Clinton is responsible for raising at least $500 million and perhaps as much as $1 billion since 1992 for his own campaigns and for Democratic candidates. He is also helping Vice President Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton collect millions of dollars for their campaigns and is also soliciting money for his presidential library.

 <textdata>
  Although he has been tireless in his fund-raising duties, Mr. Clinton seldom directly asks his audiences for cash, leaving that task to others, most notably Terry McAuliffe, who is one of the president's closest friends. Mr. McAuliffe estimated that he had raised at least $300 million for Mr. Clinton and Democratic causes, including the 1997 inaugural, the White House millennium celebration, the president's legal defense fund and the campaigns of Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton.

  Vice President Gore has asked Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to join him in eschewing soft money, but the offer was rebuffed and the soft money race has continued unabated. The two political parties have raised $160.5 million in soft money for the 2000 election, a record for this point in an election cycle.

  Senator Albert Arnold Gore of Tennessee never ran a negative campaign. In his first senatorial race, against an octogenarian incumbent, Kenneth McKellar, in the Democratic primary of 1952, he told friends it would be unseemly to make an issue of his opponent's age.

  Mr. Gore won that one, and 18 years later his political career also ended on the high road. In that last losing race, against Bill Brock, a Republican, in 1970, he never aggressively answered a range of attacks, including the untrue accusation that he had personally benefited by routing Interstate 40 through land he owned and the unfair suggestion that he had forgotten his roots while chasing after the Kennedys at Georgetown dinner parties.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And the man who defeated Senator Gore eventually apologized for the divisive tone of the campaign. His slogan, designed to appeal to disaffected whites supporting George Wallace, was ''Bill Brock believes in the things we believe in.''
 </textdata>

  Born poor in the remote settlement of Possum Hollow, Tenn., Mr. Gore lived through the worst of the Depression and spent seven years working his way through college by teaching in a one-room school -- he would spend one year earning money, then the next year spending it on his studies.

  After the vice president talked about that last conversation, though, in a eulogy he had worked on without sleeping for two nights straight, even some friends wondered whether his father had tacked on a Hollywood ending, scripting his goodbyes at least in part for the benefit of the papers, and maybe the history books. This time, nobody came right out and accused Mr. Gore himself of tweaking the dialogue.

 </textdata>

  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That perception has clearly become a political problem for the vice president. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas regularly suggests that Mr. Gore is a natural-born phony, and the vice president's every remark is now fact-checked so scrupulously that when he recently said he had once dreamed of becoming a teacher, reporters wondered if he could prove it. Had anyone ever heard that story before?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in separating the facts from the fanciful in Mr. Gore's life, perhaps the most striking discovery is the extent to which the material that is the most widely doubted is also the most demonstrably true: Al Gore did do a lot of his growing up in Tennessee. He did work hard on the farm there -- so hard, in fact, that the hired help felt sorry for him, and thought his father should ease up.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Part of the reason that the contours of Mr. Gore's unusual upbringing are not better known, however, is that he himself has worked so hard to discredit a lot of authentic stories about his childhood -- the very stories, in fact, that would probably do him the most good politically. The problem, for him, is the scenes from the past that portray Mr. Gore sympathetically at the expense of his hard-driving parents. They suggest an emotionally neglected boy forced to bear the weight of enormous adult expectations, and Mr. Gore, who is fiercely protective of his 87-year-old mother and the memory of his  father, categorically balks at that.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For a time, a decade ago, after his unsuccessful 1988 presidential campaign and his son's near-fatal car accident the next year, Mr. Gore himself seemed determined to explore the meaning of his own life story. He made a serious study of family dysfunction -- the subtext of his 1992 environmental manifesto, ''Earth in the Balance'' -- and passed out copies of Alice Miller's ''Drama of the Gifted Child,'' a book about how narcissistic parents can leave their high-achieving children cut off from their own feelings and hazy on just what they want, other than to make Mom and Dad proud. Back then, friends said, he was absorbed by the need to figure things out, to emerge from his father's shadow. To decide.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But today, Mr. Gore seems nothing if not decided. He does want to be president, and if he can never really know exactly how much of that want began with his parents, his current attitude seems to be: So what? ''One of the oldest plots in the human story is child follows parent,'' he said recently, with what sure seemed like authentic boredom. And looking back on his early years did not seem so very difficult.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a series of interviews about his life, he was relaxed and appeared at peace with the past. He frankly described a childhood in which even the usual juvenile scrapes might become part of continuing political calculations -- maybe the same way writers often end up milking their families for material. When he got in trouble for throwing whitewash on trucks as they passed the Gore farm when he was 12, for example, his father made him send letters of apology to a number of trucking companies. ''That was also an election year, I believe,'' he remarked wryly. But, he made clear, it was also just a kid's life.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I was conceived in Tennessee,'' Mr. Gore began, drawling for effect, in a radio announcer voice that poked fun at the whole biographical exercise.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His real childhood was in Tennessee; in Washington, he spent his time with adults --  important adults, in whose presence he was expected to behave beautifully, and did. Tennessee was, at the very least, where Al Gore wished he had grown up.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I went up there'' when Mr. Gore was in high school ''and the friend he had in the Fairfax was a bellhop,'' Mr. Armistead said. ''There were all these dignitaries, but not much for a kid. There was a dullness, a loneliness about it. He didn't lay around Washington much when he could have been in Carthage, and that's where he got his values, working on the farm and growing up around Smith County people.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Of course, Mr. Gore is the product of both Washington and Tennessee -- and of the very fact of having grown up in two places, with two groups of friends and two ways of looking at the world. He was born in Washington, lived in Tennessee from the time he was 1 until he was 4, while his father ran for the Senate, and then moved between the two places until college.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore himself seems to feel that his split-screen view of the world was a gift, at least in the end.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And he and his wife thought that working on the farm would be good for their son, whom they told friends they hoped would be president one day. ''It was expected from the time he was little,'' said James Fleming, a Nashville doctor and friend of Nancy Gore's, who for a time served as the Gore family physician. It was not so much that the Gores thought cleaning out barns would add just the right touch of ''log cabin'' to his resume, family friends said, as that they simply felt it would toughen him up and give him a proper work ethic.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He'd drive him pretty hard,'' said Gordon Thompson, a friend whose family used to live on the Gore farm, back when his own father worked for the senator.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Once, after Mr. Gore and Ms. Armistead  had done a particularly hard job on the farm, the senator told him to take her out for a meal at a certain cafe. ''We were so thrilled,'' she remembered. ''But after dinner Al gets up to the cash register and said, 'My dad said to charge it to him,' and the guy wouldn't do it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, his time in Tennessee was not all boot camp and character building, and Mr. Gore did manage to have some unscripted fun. Mr. Thompson remembers his friend as ''pranky,'' with a love of practical jokes that endures today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One New Year's Eve, several of his friends said, their whole group was snowed in at the Gore farm, so Pauline Gore corralled all the girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boys in Al's room on the lower level. The senator, dressed in his bathrobe, sat sentry duty at the top of the stairs all night long, and every so often yelled downstairs to his son and the other boys, who were busy sharing one bottle of beer.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But there were also times, even as a kid, when Mr. Gore flouted authority more directly. Once, while staying with the Thompsons, he heard that his father, who was away, was going to be giving a speech in Nashville, 55 miles east. His parents, though, had decided that their son should not come to the event.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Like a lot of mothers, Pauline Gore always insisted publicly that her son was at all times the perfect boy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was not shy about expressing affection for his girlfriend in front of his mother. ''I remember Pauline and I drove him to the airport one time,'' said Ms.  Armistead, ''and he kissed her on the cheek and then he kissed me. I mean, he laid one on me, honey.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But she also says Mrs. Gore need not have worried. ''Sex was sex even then,'' Ms. Armistead said, ''but Al and I both had goals.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today, the vice president seems to enjoy looking back on the benign pleasures of the summers when he got to be a kid in Tennessee -- skinny-dipping with Mr. Thompson in a cattle trough or hypnotizing chickens, which Mr. Gore says is ''a little-known farm skill passed down from adolescent wizard to adolescent wizard.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also situates himself politically in Tennessee, as heir not only to his father but to Cordell Hull, whom he describes as ''the model for public service in our part of the country.'' Mr. Hull floated logs down the Cumberland River with Mr. Gore's grandfather, settled in Carthage and became the congressman in the seat the Gore father and son later held.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  An ardent free-trader, Mr. Hull won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in founding GATT, now the World Trade Organization, and was secretary of state in World War II. ''But before that he was a judge on the circuit, and in 10 counties there, the picture above the judge's chair in the courtroom is neither George Washington, Thomas Jefferson nor Franklin Roosevelt,'' Mr. Gore said, with the greatest possible reverence. ''It's Cordell Hull to this day.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked to name the most important things he had inherited from his parents, Mr. Gore  talked for a long time about his father and his father's ideals. But the first thing he said in answer to the question was this:
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''But he became a statesman,'' too, Mr. Gore said. ''I've often thought in my father's persona he continued to manifest both.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His friends feel sure Mr. Gore would move back to Carthage if, as Mr. Thompson delicately put it, ''worse comes to worst.'' The vice president laughed at that, but agreed. ''Well, I'll retire in Carthage for sure,'' he said. ''You know, I hope that's many years from now.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  The owner, Grady Gore, was a cousin of the senator's. Louise Gore, one of Grady's daughters, lived in the hotel. Her sister, Mary Gore Dean, moved in, too, after her husband died in a plane crash. For a while, their brother Jimmy Gore and his family were on the premises, as well. When they moved, it was just down the block.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And one thing that seems to bother Mr. Gore -- far more, in fact, than the idea that his 52 years add up to something that is not so much a life as a story line -- is the perception that ''I was in this luxury apartment eating room service, sort of like Eloise.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  (His cousin also remembers Senator Gore teaching him to swim by throwing him into a pool when he was 4, while Al, who was 7, looked on, laughing.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Two of Mr. Gore's closest Washington friends recall that while Al Gore was the focus of his parents' fondest hopes, it was his free-spirited, rebellious sister, Nancy, who took more of their energy. ''The general topic of conversation over there was what outrageous thing Nancy did this week,'' said one of these friends. ''She got a lot of attention and Al was kind of an afterthought, because he never misbehaved.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For him, the best times were those spent throwing a ball around with his father at Grady Gore's estate in Potomac, Md. ''He had some cattle from the Tennessee farm brought up there,'' Mr. Gore said, smirking like he knows that sounds kind of crazy. ''And a lot of times on weekends we'd go up there and he'd work with the cattle and I'd help him and then we'd take a break.'' Sometimes, too, they played catch in the Russell building, outside the senator's office, though if someone walked by, ''he'd duck back into the office until they passed'' because ''it wasn't very dignified,'' the son recalled. When Al Gore had real ballgames, though, it was his sister, not his father, who would come.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  More often, his father took him to Senate hearings. He sat through long stretches of discussion over the bill, co-sponsored by his father, that created the Interstate System of highways. How wide would the new roads be? Green or blue for the road signs? As a kid, Mr. Gore followed these developments avidly, keeping track of the miles of completed highway the way other kids his age followed the Yankees' box scores.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He also took me on the Senate floor, even though he wasn't supposed to,'' Mr. Gore remembered. And one day, when Al was 5, he was invited to come up front to meet the vice president, Richard M. Nixon, who was presiding that day: ''He put me on his knee and was very nice to me, and the experience forever after deprived me of the more sublime pleasures of Nixon hatred.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They all wanted, each in their own way, to be part of that excitement. And the entire family talked a lot about not just the bills before Congress but the big issues of the day, especially civil rights. In these discussions, was his mother more liberal than his father, as some who knew the couple have suggested? ''Mmmmm, my dad was pretty liberal,'' Mr. Gore answered. ''She was, like most moms, the conscience of the family, but they didn't really disagree. And my sister was more liberal than both of them put together.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Then Mr. Gore started to laugh, and kept on for a good long time. ''It was a family of many consciences,'' he said.

  Up on the roof of the Washington hotel where he grew up, the old Fairfax, now a much tonier Westin, Vice President Al Gore was standing at the edge. There is no railing on the roof of the eight-story building and Mr. Gore was trying to goad a reporter into following him there.

  For Mr. Clinton, the problem has not been a lack of vision. Once in office, he quickly cast away his campaign attacks on President Bush for ''coddling dictators'' in Beijing. And since 1994, he has steadily built on his theme that the Internet and China's growing economic ties to the West would ultimately create pressures for political openness that Beijing will not be able to control.

  Referring to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Chase said: ''I used to talk to him all the time when he was on his bus tour. TV is the issue. I told Bill when he started to campaign: 'You're answering questions too fast. You sound like a kid. George Bush is the president. He looks like it and he acts like it. Take more time, take a minute -- or what you think is a minute -- to answer a question. Look presidential.' He would call me and ask 'How'm I doing?' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Right now, Bush comes off as the more competent fellow -- and he certainly has all the money to be on TV anytime he wants -- and Gore comes off a little stiff,'' he continued. ''But when it comes to substantive issues and the two of them debate, I think -- and hope -- that the country will see that Gore is way ahead of Bush.''

  In the end, the vote was more one-sided than many had predicted. The House speaker, Dennis Hastert, and his deputies Dick Armey and Tom DeLay were more successful than the president in bringing along their party faithful, many of whom were persuaded by the business interests lobbying furiously until the very end. Gov. George W. Bush and a raft of respected Republican former presidents, cabinet members and officeholders helped. On the Democratic side, Mr. Clinton got only 73 votes against a tough campaign waged by unions and by the House Democratic leadership.

  BUSH ON CHARACTER -- Taking his campaign to a major swing state, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas declared yesterday in Detroit that education was ''the new civil right.'' With Michigan's popular Republican governor, John Engler, at his side, Mr. Bush spent more than an hour discussing the importance of equal access to education with students, teachers, parents and volunteers at the Cornerstone Schools, a private religion-oriented group of middle and elementary schools. ''We can't have any gaps of hope in the country,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The American dream is available for everyone, which means every child must be educated.''

  HESTON AND GORE, ARMED -- Charlton Heston's vow as president of the National Rifle Association to defend to the death the right to bear arms drew a chuckle yesterday from Vice President Al Gore, the association's top political target. Mr. Gore said Mr. Heston and other association officials were dead wrong when they said last week at the association's annual convention in Charlotte, N.C., that he wanted to disarm America. Alluding to the moment at the convention when the Mr. Heston raised a flintlock musket over his head and pledged to die defending his constitutional right to have it, Mr. Gore said in an interview with National Public Radio: ''I have no intentions of proposing or supporting policies or allowing policies that would disarm America. What I have proposed that has upset him so much is a set of common-sense restrictions on the availability of handguns.'' Referring to defending his right to bear arms to the death, Mr. Heston said, ''So as we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that would take freedom away, I want to say those fighting words, for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to heed, and especially you, Mr. Gore.'' When Mr. Heston's comment with musket raised was read to Mr. Gore yesterday, he chuckled.

  Voters may not pay much attention to potential Supreme Court appointments, but interest groups sure do. And the National Rifle Association, the right-wing religious organizations, anti-abortion zealots and other extremist wanderers of the nation's far-right terrain are praying that George W. Bush becomes president and gets to appoint two or three more Clarence Thomases or Antonin Scalias to the court.

  Many of the rights and liberties that Americans have come to take for granted over the past few decades are now in the cross-hairs and well within range of the right-wing extremists. The next president will likely appoint two or three new justices to the court, and possibly four. (Three of the current justices are 70 or older.) And Mr. Bush has made it clear that he favors justices in the mold of Scalia and Thomas, the court's two most right-wing members.

  Last week's decision on the Violence Against Women Act affirmed a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., one of the most right-wing courts in the nation. The Fourth Circuit opinion was written by Judge J. Michael Luttig, who is frequently mentioned as a potential George W. Bush appointee to the Supreme Court.

  George W. Bush and a phalanx of famed cold warriors brought it off this week. They denounced the arms-control doves seeking to curry favor with Vladimir Putin at the forthcoming Moscow summit meeting as -- hold your breath -- a pack of unreconstructed cold-war relics.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  That effectively exposed the Putin-Clinton dealing on ABM and Start III as a meaningless charade. But it posed a political appearance problem for the Bush campaign. How to oppose the summit stunt without seeming to be obstructionist, triumphalist, nasty to the Russians or, worst of all, subject to accusations of being an unreconstructed cold warrior?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But this performance by the Bush front-line brain trust was played with a remarkable rhetorical twist. Instead of hunkering down to await the usual ''unreconstructed cold warriors'' blast from the White House,  Bush charged the Clinton-Gore administration with being ''locked in a cold-war mentality.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That stole the opposition's clothes. Calling for ''a new era of nuclear security,'' Bush announced: ''The cold-war era is history. Our nation must recognize new threats, not fixate on old ones.'' He anticipated a knee-jerk Gore reaction with a built-in response: ''It is possible to build a missile defense and defuse confrontation with Russia. America should do both.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He then showed arms-control sophisticates he had an understanding of the potential Putin-Clinton summit dodge: ''Start III should not be an excuse to limit our ability to build a missile defense system.'' Rather than let a Russian deal on amending ABM determine the number of missiles in our arsenal, the U.S. military would determine how few are required for our security; Bush would then ask Russia to match the cuts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A serious issue is joined. Thanks to deft presentation, the Clinton-Gore side is the one lost in the mists of the old ''cold-war mentality.''

  Some of the rich and famous certainly think so. Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson came by two weeks ago. So did Robert DeNiro. Michael Jackson has dropped by. And George and Barbara Bush, whose photograph adorns his office. ''I've built them a presidential suite,'' Mr. Nygard said, pointing to a cabana built into artificial cliffs some 60 feet high. No, the former first couple haven't stayed over.

  In an interview, Mr. Gore reiterated his strong opposition to Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to allow individuals to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes on Wall Street. And he defended his own decision to back away from his early support for allowing the government itself to invest in stocks on Social Security's behalf. He said that his shift was driven by a recognition that allowing the government to become a big shareholder would create problems and that the stock market had not generated as consistently strong returns as he had once assumed.

  ''The learning experience that we went through convinced all of us that it was a bad idea,'' Mr. Gore said of government investment in the market.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Tracing the evolution of his thinking about Social Security and the financial markets, Mr. Gore said that he had kept an open mind to many possible solutions to the retirement system's problems when the Clinton administration began examining the issue in earnest a few years ago.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign has sought to use Mr. Gore's on-again, off-again support for government investment in the stock market to undermine the vice president's assertions that Social Security benefits should not be dependent on Wall Street. And Mr. Bush's aides said Mr. Gore's reversal on the issue suggested that he was prepared to sacrifice principles to make a short-term political point.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''There is a growing sense that Al Gore has never had a conviction which he could not easily change,'' said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman. ''He was clearly on record as advocating and supporting government investment in the market. Now he's walking away from something he advocated as recently as 1999.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some advisers to Mr. Gore said the vice president had dropped his support for government investment in part to make it easier for him to attack Mr. Bush's approach.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in the interview, on the porch of his home on the grounds of the Naval Observatory, Mr. Gore sought to play down the degree to which he had supported the concept, and said that in any case he had changed his mind as he learned more about the tradeoffs it would require.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said he had been swayed in part by criticism of the idea from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Greenspan opposed the plan on the grounds that politicians would not be able to resist using the government's role as a shareholder to favor or punish certain industries or to meddle in corporate decisions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The magnitude of the government's stock ownership would be such that it would at least raise the question of whether or not we had begun to change the fundamental nature of our economy,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Upon reflection, it seemed to me that those problems were quite serious.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Moreover, Mr. Gore said, he became convinced that Wall Street's ups and downs were large enough to create a risk that the government might be making a bad investment. During long stretches -- including from the late 1960's to the early 1980's, Wall Street was by no means the one-way bet it has often been viewed as in recent years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although Mr. Gore receives income from some stock technically owned by his mother, he owns no stock, and has never actively invested in the market. He said he had chosen to stay out of the market when he first was elected to Congress in 1976 to avoid any conflicts of interest, not out of fear of risk, and that he supported a variety of proposals to promote savings and investment.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But he said investment in the markets should ''come on top of Social Security,'' rather than as a replacement for it. And he said that Mr. Bush's economic policies, including his big tax cut and his need to use much of the Social Security surplus to pay for the creation of private accounts, would undermine the fiscal discipline that has helped propel the markets upward in recent years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's approach ''contains the seeds of its own destruction by virtually guaranteeing a weaker economy, and thus, you would expect, a weaker market, with lower returns than what we've seen in these boom years,'' Mr. Gore said.

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''People are starting to ask, 'When does he get started? When does he get focused? How did Bush catch up? When does the show hit the road?' '' Mr. Rangel said in an interview on Tuesday. ''They're saying, 'If this is a policy to lay back and wait for the debates, then share it with somebody!' There's no fiery speeches being given; we don't have the surrogates out there.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. Torricelli described the problem: ''Until Al Gore actually goes to Los Angeles and receives his party's nomination and campaigns in his own right, he will still be identified by most Americans as Bill Clinton's vice president. There is still not a separate identity, and only the dramatic departure from Los Angeles is going to create this new identity.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Rangel and Mr. Torricelli, and others in their party, said they were concerned that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Gore's Republican rival, had made better use of the post-primary season than Mr. Gore had. They also worried that the Gore campaign did not seem to be responding to recent polls that have shown him trailing Mr. Bush and losing support among broad segments of the public, including suburban women, white men and every age group except the elderly.

  In a radio interview this morning, Mr. Gore brushed aside questions about being stalled in the polls, insisting that such surveys this far in advance of Election Day -- Nov. 7 -- are ''notoriously wrong.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm not trying to have an impact on the polls,'' Mr. Gore said on the ''Diane Rehm Show'' on public radio station WAMU in Washington. ''I'm trying to deliver a message to the people of this country.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore responded, ''The process of communication that takes place in a campaign is not best analyzed on a daily or hourly basis.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He suggested that his strategy against Governor Bush -- which his advisers said was rooted in the compare-and-contrast method he used against former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey in the primaries -- would need time to yield results.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I think that the dialogue on complex issues often takes time,'' Mr. Gore said. ''It takes time for facts to emerge, for judgments to sink in, for people to really come to a conclusion about how they feel about the candidates, about the positions on the issues and about where we're going in the future.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Rangel and Mr. Torricelli said there was plenty of time for Mr. Gore to recover. Mr. Rangel described the atmosphere among his fellow Democrats as one of concern, not alarm. ''This is May,'' he said. ''When the question is raised'' with campaign officials, he said, ''they say no one gets serious until Labor Day.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Of course, elected officials like Mr. Rangel have a huge stake in the party's success in November. If Democrats win back the House, Mr. Rangel is in line to become chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, and broadcasting concern about the presidential campaign this early is one way of nudging Mr. Gore into trying to fix things before they become worse.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Senator Torricelli said of the Gore campaign's problem: ''It is both manageable and, I suspect, temporary.''

  Mr. Gore's last major address that drew front-page coverage was on April 30, when he spoke in Boston on foreign policy and raised questions about Mr. Bush's ''cold war'' mindset. Since then, Governor Bush has largely dictated the issues.

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''His poll numbers flow directly from his disappearance from the radar screen for a number of weeks while Bush pressed the 'on' button and kept himself on the screen,'' she said. Representative Eliot L. Engel, a Bronx Democrat, said that Mr. Gore had not capitalized on his victory in the primaries. ''We thought at the end of the primaries that Bush was all the way to the right and Gore was well-positioned and I had hoped we would see a change in the polls, but we're seeing slippage and that's disappointing,'' Mr. Engel said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''With Bill Clinton, he gets up every morning and wants to meet voters. Al Gore, he does what he has to do, but I don't think he relishes that, and I think people pick up on that. He needs to talk very positively for what he stands for rather than being negative about Bush.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Gore advisers keep saying that the vice president is ''right on the issues'' and that his positions, from tolerance on social matters like abortion to paying down the national debt, are more in tune with those of a majority of Americans. Nonetheless, political analysts say Mr. Gore seems to have trouble articulating that message.

  Prof. James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University and a member of the audience this morning while Mr. Gore was interviewed at the radio station, said that even after almost a quarter century in politics, Mr. Gore still did not grasp some of the fundamentals of political communication.

  Re ''Benefits and Drawbacks to Bush and Gore Proposals for Overhauling Social Security'' (news article, May 19): The most significant argument against privatizing part of Social Security is that diverting tax dollars out of the Social Security system increases the projected long-term shortfall in the program, leading to major cuts in benefits, increases in the retirement age and cuts in annual cost-of-living adjustments. These are cuts that are typically not fully replaced by any income from a private account.

  So in rapid succession, Mr. Bush  promised to introduce individual investment accounts into Social Security but left out fundamental details like what portion of the payroll tax he would devote to them. And similarly this week, he opened the door to unilateral nuclear weapons reductions coupled with a missile defense system that would protect all 50 states and many of America's allies.

  Mr. Bush's aides and supporters argue that on certain kinds of issues this is the most effective way to lead, that locking into particulars now ensures failure later. Yet it is also the case that the governor's style has some other effects too: It allows him to look like a leader while making it much more difficult for his opponents to get a handhold to grapple with him and his ideas.

  Vice President Al Gore is the master of picking apart the details of a proposal. Just remember what he did to former Senator Bill Bradley's health care plan in the Democratic primaries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in the Social Security debate he has been left assailing Mr. Bush's ''secret plan'' and trying to fill in the details for his Republican opponent, as he did today in an interview on National Public Radio. Mr. Gore said the transition to individual accounts would inevitably also entail ''raising the retirement age or cutting benefits.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still Douglas Hattaway, Mr. Gore's spokesman acknowledged, speaking of Mr. Bush, ''It's harder to have a real debate on the issues when he refuses to say what he really intends to do.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  5-25-2000

 <textdata>
  The limited missile defense system under development, which envisions bases in Alaska with 100 interceptor missiles, has been estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost $60 billion. A broader system, which Mr. Bush is considering, might cost $116 billion or more.

  On Social Security, while many  Congressional plans contain some elements of individual accounts like those proposed by Mr. Bush, the details, too, have been problematic. A number of the plans also contain painful medicine like benefit cuts, lower cost-of-living increases or an increase in the retirement age.

  Should voters know the full costs and benefits of Mr. Bush's ideas? Anita Dunn, who was Mr. Bradley's communications director, argues that they should -- even if such details could make the plans a fat target in the way Mr. Bradley's health care proposal became.

  Mr. Bush's aides and some political scientists counter that there are some issues on which too much detail is counterproductive to governing. And they point to the fate of another doomed health care plan: the one championed by Hillary Rodham Clinton.

  By leaving out the details of Mr. Bush's Social Security plan, his aides say, Mr. Bush will allow Congress to help shape the plan and have pride of authorship. They note that this is how the governor operated in Texas, presenting basic concepts and allowing the Legislature to shape the details.

  Will Mr. Bush eventually have to provide more detail on these issues as November nears? Some supporters of Mr. Bush say no, that what voters want now -- particularly independent voters -- is a sign that a presidential candidate will put forward ideas that may break the gridlock in Washington.

  And it underscored a sad reality for Mr. Gore: As at some of the other joint appearances of the Clintons and Gores in the past, while Mr. Gore is meant to be the star, Mr. Clinton steals the show. ''Four more years!'' was shouted from the crowd as he spoke.

As you report (news article, May 23), Gov. George W.

  Such words found an echo last week when Gov. George W. Bush sided with the Clinton administration in opposing a measure pushed by Senate Republicans that would have set a strict deadline for withdrawing American troops from Kosovo. He called it ''legislative overreach,'' which, if enacted, would hamper his ability to conduct policy should he be elected president in November. The bill failed, but 40 of the 55 Republican senators supported it.

  Nor are presidential candidates barred from developing their own foreign policy ideas. On the contrary, as Mr. Bush's recent comments on nuclear security show, he is willing to state his differences with President Clinton on sensitive matters. But in doing so, he has sent a broader message of continuity, most obviously by appearing at a news conference on Tuesday with Henry Kissinger and Colin Powell, two Republicans who are respected by Democrats. Unlike Congressional Republicans, Mr. Bush seems to recognize the distinction between principled opposition and vengeful obstructionism, and to know how destructive the latter can be.

  But if we have President Gore instead, the Republicans might grow even testier, battling the perceived usurper at every juncture. Will they attack Mr. Gore just as McCarthy and company attacked Harry Truman, not only for his sins but for those committed by the popular president whose coattails he rode into office?

  Republicans would do far better to follow Mr. Bush's lead, not only because it is more statesmanlike but because history is on his side.

  Despite differences with their predecessors, each achieved triumphs by staying the course of a bipartisan foreign policy. And each had legislative help. If Mr. Bush is elected, he will need it, too. But he also needs it now if the country is to feel confident in Republican leadership. He needs an Arthur Vandenberg. Sadly, he doesn't appear to be in sight.

  The mountains of West Virginia are home to coal and its miners. And Mr. Bush has called for significantly more federal spending on ''clean coal'' technologies, asserting that he would expand the country's energy supply, while President Clinton and Mr. Gore had choked it with excessive regulation.

  GORE STILL LEADS IN NEW JERSEY -- Vice President Al Gore holds a double-digit lead over Gov. George W. Bush in New Jersey even though most voters favor Mr. Bush's plan for a partially privatized Social Security, a poll released yesterday shows. Mr. Gore led 49 percent to 35 percent among 820 likely voters surveyed from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1 by Quinnipiac University. The poll, which has a three percentage point margin of error, gave Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, 6 percent and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party 1 percent.

  BUCHANAN WINS A ROUND -- Patrick J. Buchanan, the Reform Party candidate, won a spot on the ballot yesterday in Florida, a hotly contested state where polls show Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush about even.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Polls among likely Florida voters have shown only 1 percent to 3 percent supporting Mr. Buchanan. But with Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush tied in the race for Florida's 25 electoral votes, Mr. Buchanan could affect the outcome if he draws more heavily from one of the main parties than the other.

  Mr. Bush would give almost everyone a tax cut, while Mr. Gore would give tax relief only to low-income families and those with modest incomes and special expenses like children in day care or college or those with elderly dependents.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The examination found that the Bush plan would be much more generous to the wealthy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For example, a couple earning $450,000 would have their income taxes reduced by more than $12,000 a year. The Gore plan would be of no benefit to this family.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore proposal would also give no tax relief to single people and childless couples, including retirees, even those with modest incomes who would save some taxes under the Bush plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the other hand, Mr. Gore would give a much larger rebate than Mr. Bush to low-income single-parent families, like a mother with two or three children and an income of $29,000.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Since Mr. Bush's plan is twice as costly as Mr. Gore's -- slightly more than $1 trillion over 10 years, not counting his proposed repeal of the estate tax, as against about $500 billion for the Gore plan -- it is not surprising that Mr. Bush would give bigger tax savings to more families than Mr. Gore would.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore would spend the difference on the national debt and on popular government programs like education, universal health insurance for children and prescription drug coverage for those on Medicare. Mr. Bush holds that the tax cut would allow people and not the government to decide the best way to allocate resources.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The main element in the Bush plan is an across-the-board reduction in tax rates that would be enjoyed by all taxpayers. In addition, he would double the existing tax credit for each child to $1,000 from $500, and for two-earner couples, he would give an additional deduction of up to $3,000.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The principal aspects of the Gore plan are an expansion of the existing earned-income tax credit for low-income workers, an increase in the maximum child-care credit to $2,400 from $960, an additional credit for after-school expenses for children 13 through 16, a higher standard deduction for working couples who do not itemize deductions, a $3,000 credit to families who care for ill or disabled relatives, a tax credit to people without employer-paid health insurance to help offset the cost of buying insurance and a tax break of up to $2,800 to help offset the cost of college tuition.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For example, a couple with three children in day care and an income of $39,000 would be better off in terms of taxes under the Bush proposals. The doubling of the tax credit for children under the Bush plan would save more in taxes at that income level than Mr. Gore's child credit.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And a rather affluent self-employed couple with an income of $78,000 and a child in college would save more under the Gore plan because of Mr. Gore's tax break to help offset the cost of tuition.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush plan was treated as if it were fully in effect, although that would not be the case until 2006. The Gore plan would all go into effect at once.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But it is worth noting, for example, that under the Gore plan, the working couple in the study with an income of $78,000 would have had almost its entire tax liability eliminated if it had an ill grandparent living in the house.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For the purposes of the study, the accountants at Deloitte &amp; Touche did not consider Mr. Bush's proposal to abolish the estate tax, since it would not affect anyone's annual income tax. Nor did they include proposals by both candidates for tax-free retirement and savings accounts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The computer model used by the accountants in examining the Bush proposals did not make adjustments for the effect of the alternative minimum tax. This is a provision of the existing law originally intended to make sure wealthy people paid taxes even if they had large deductions and exemptions. Increasingly in recent years, taxpayers with more modest incomes and smaller deductions have found they owed additional taxes under the provision.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's economic advisers have acknowledged that the alternative minimum tax would mean somewhat smaller tax savings under his plan than would otherwise be the case for many affluent taxpayers. There would be little if any effect on taxpayers under the Gore plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed research organization, included the alternative minimum tax in its model and found that under the Bush plan, the tax savings would be reduced by 44 percent for a family earning $125,000, by 79 percent for a family with an income of $185,000 and by 41 percent for a family with an income of $400,000. The effect on most families with incomes below $80,000 would be inconsequential.

  THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TAX PLANS  Correction:  October 4, 2000, Wednesday  A chart yesterday showing the effect of the presidential candidates' tax plans on 12 hypothetical individuals and families misstated the taxes for one case -- a single parent with three children and an annual income of $29,000. That family would be due a rebate of $1,210 under current law, $2,218 under the Bush plan and $3,462 under the Gore plan; it would not owe those amounts.

  The chart also labeled one case incorrectly. The family that would save $2,322 under the Bush plan and $1,038 under the Gore plan was a working couple with three children and an annual income of $39,000 -- not two children and an income of $39,000.

  With Indonesia, Russia and Pakistan, the world's fourth, sixth and seventh largest countries, already messy states, and with China likely to become one when Communism collapses, four of the world's seven most populated countries will be messy states. Only America, Brazil and India don't qualify. One wonders how Al Gore or George W. Bush proposes to deal with messy states, because this is not a phase. This is the future. Or as President Wahid himself joked: the Suharto era here was known as the ''New Order,'' the post-Suharto era led by B. J. Habibie was known for being ''Out of Order,'' and the Wahid period is known as ''No Order.''

  Judge Kent's ruling defused another potential capital punishment controversy in Texas, which leads the nation in executions, at a time when Mr. Bush is entering the final weeks of the presidential race.

  Mr. Haas, who said he had handled capital cases but never a clemency appeal, said he had sought a 30-day reprieve from Mr. Bush after the parole board informed him that it would not consider the late clemency petition. Mr. Haas said he had not received an answer from the governor's office by this afternoon's hearing. Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, said the governor did not decide on requests for reprieves until an inmate had exhausted all legal appeals.

Bush in Boston, Mr. Gore's aides, seeking to put a local human face on an event of national importance, pitched their stories relentlessly to the news media in those places.

  The coverage of Mr. Gore's everyday people did, at times, verge on political comedy, as in the case of the progress of Winnifred Skinner, a 79-year-old retiree from Des Moines. Mrs. Skinner bypassed the trip to Florida and instead was driven by the Gore campaign to Boston in a motor home with her poodle, Bridget. Mrs. Skinner had come to the campaign's attention when she spoke up at a rally in Altoona, Iowa, last week, telling Mr. Gore that she collected empty cans and bottles for money to pay for her prescription drugs.

  The Gore campaign managed to virtually guarantee favorable publicity in the cities and markets it had singled out through its band of real people. The selections, in fact, were often described in language reserved for lottery winners.

  ''We are absolutely having a blast,'' Miss Conner is quoted as saying. She also reports that the group gave Mr. Gore ''feedback on what he needs to do to improve his demeanor or the way he spoke,'' although she herself was effusive in her praise. ''I liked everything he had to say,'' she told the paper.

  In Oregon, a television news crew  showed up at the airport in Medford to tape the departure of Katherine Cowan, a homemaker from Lake Oswego who had met Mr. Gore in August at a campaign appearance at Portland State University. She had spoken to him about her concerns about health care for her daughter Lindsay, who has diabetes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Oregonian, the state's largest newspaper, wrote a comparatively restrained piece about Ms. Cowan's selection, pointing out in the lead of the article, which was displayed inside the paper's main news section, that both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore ''have been relentless about featuring real folks in their campaign appearances.'' Jeff Mapes, who wrote the article, said the Gore campaign's Oregon representatives had been on the phone repeatedly, providing updates and inquiring about possible follow-ups.

  Celebrity, of course, has its price.  One of the Mr. Gore's guests in Florida said privately that some of the other real people were trying to get in their 15 minutes of fame before the Gore campaign arrived in Boston for fear that ''the tin-can lady'' would grab the headlines.

  Your article about the negotiating between the Bush and Gore camps over microphones, the height of the lecterns and the timing of questions made me wonder: if each voter could get these two in a room minus the makeup, costumes, campaign teams and sound bites, would either George W.

  On the eve of the first presidential debate here, most Americans say Gov. George W.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The lingering questions about Mr. Bush's preparedness do not seem to have affected his overall standing in the head-to-head competition as reflected in the poll. Not since 1960 has a presidential contest been this close on the eve of a first debate.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Still, Mr. Bush, the Texas governor, has been struggling with the issue of his readiness to be president since the campaign began, and it is a matter that his advisers say he will try to put to rest in the first of three encounters with Mr. Gore. The first debate will be on Tuesday night at 9 Eastern time at the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Taken as a whole, the survey had much encouraging news for Mr. Gore and very little for Mr. Bush. Beyond the findings about Mr. Bush's preparedness, the poll found that the governor's personal popularity has eroded slightly as Mr. Gore's has continued to improve.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The race is so competitive, the survey found, that the difference in support between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush is statistically insignificant. That said, no matter how the support is defined -- whether in terms of voters who have made up their minds or voters who are only now leaning toward one candidate but are still undecided -- Mr. Gore usually emerges a few points ahead.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a four-way contest, Mr. Gore was backed by 45 percent of registered voters, Mr. Bush by 39 percent, and Patrick J. Buchanan and Ralph Nader were each below 5 percent. When voters' awareness of the race and their past voting are taken into account, Mr. Gore draws 45 percent and Mr. Bush 41 percent. If the possibility of a low turnout is added to the mix, Mr. Gore's advantage would be  even more insignificant: one percentage point.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The state of the contest is all the more unpredictable because voters do not seem whole-heartedly loyal to their favored candidate. More than 4 of 10 Bush or Gore supporters said they were not enthusiastic about their candidate -- and have some misgivings about voting for him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The most striking finding in the survey is the extent to which voters have reservations about Mr. Bush's preparedness. Their concerns may reflect their knowledge that Mr. Gore has served as vice president for eight years and, before that, was in the House and Senate for 16 years. By contrast, Mr. Bush did not hold public office until he was elected governor of Texas in 1994.
 </textdata>

  Lynn Eagleeye, a poll respondent from Bay Village, Ohio, said in a follow-up interview today that she was an independent but leaning toward Mr. Gore. ''Gore has had more experience in the arena, but I think they would both make good presidents,'' said Mrs. Eagleeye, 57, a real estate agent. ''Experience comes with the job and comes with time. It's not just the president running the country, it's his team of advisers. I liked the job Bush's father did with foreign policy, and I think George W. has a good adviser in that area.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But others, especially Republicans, were not daunted by Mr. Gore's longer record of public service. ''Even though Gore has been vice president, I don't feel like he's done a lot,'' said Wanda Stucky, 63, a homemaker in Bolivar, Ohio. ''I liked Bush's father and I think some of that ability and knowledge has rubbed off on him. Gore just does not impress me as a leader.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Thomas Reynolds, 64, a repairman from Somerset, Ky., said he was a Republican but was still torn between the candidates. ''Bush is probably not as prepared for the presidency as Gore,'' Mr. Reynolds said, ''but I think he could be an effective president. You learn as you go, and Bush as the experience of governing Texas.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, in the poll, many voters gave Mr. Gore far higher marks for being ready to take over.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When respondents were asked if each candidate had prepared himself well enough for the presidency or needed more time to do more, Mr. Gore was seen by 71 percent of voters as having prepared himself well enough, while 24 percent said he needed to do more. But Mr. Bush was seen as well prepared by just under half, 49 percent, while 43 percent of voters said he needed to prepare  more.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On their capacity to negotiate with world leaders, 68 percent said Mr. Gore could do that effectively, while 48 percent said that of Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was also viewed as more capable of dealing with Congress.  Seventy-one percent of registered voters said Mr. Gore had the skills needed to work with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress; 59 percent said the same of Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet for all the concerns about Mr. Bush's lack of preparedness, voters  thought that he had the potential to be an able leader. Of the poll respondents who favor Mr. Gore, for example, only 20 percent said Mr. Bush was adequately prepared for the presidency. Still, 40 percent of  Gore backers said Mr. Bush would make an effective leader.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Despite the closeness of the race, there were underlying trends that appear to favor Mr. Gore. For the first time, the balance between Mr. Bush's favorable and unfavorable  ratings -- long one of his most potent advantages -- has begun to erode while Mr. Gore's has improved markedly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is seen favorably by 43 percent of voters and unfavorably by 30 percent, a positive balance of 13 points. But just before the national convention, Mr. Bush was seen favorably by 44 percent and unfavorably by 26 percent, a positive balance of 18 points.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the latest poll, Mr. Gore is seen favorably by 49 percent of voters and unfavorably by 28 percent, a positive balance of 21 points. Before the conventions, Mr. Gore was seen favorably by 36 percent of voters and unfavorably by 35 percent, essentially a draw.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet for all his gains in likability, Mr. Gore said he intended to emphasize issue differences in the debate, a reflection, perhaps, of the fact that on most issues, the poll found that Americans still side with Democrats. Voters say they like the direction the country has been moving and are not eager to change course. Their concerns continue to be health care, including Medicare, followed by education, Social Security and taxes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore holds sway with voters on health care, prescription drugs and caring about the average American, while Mr. Bush does better on strengthening the military and lowering taxes.

  A plurality of voters said the high price of heating oil affected them personally. But while the topic has consumed a significant amount of energy on the campaign trail, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gore was given an advantage by voters who were asked which one could bring about lower prices.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a finding that may be cause for concern among Republican candidates, the poll found that Mr. Bush's candidacy has not helped the overall image of his party. Forty-nine percent of voters say they hold a favorable view of the Republicans, while 44 percent hold an unfavorable view. By contrast, 58 percent of voters say they hold a favorable view of the Democratic Party, while 36 percent hold an unfavorable view.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But on one important issue -- education -- Mr. Bush may have helped his party with his nonstop appearances at schools. As recently as July, voters were more likely to view the Democrats as better able than the Republicans to improve education, by a margin of 45 to 33, a 12-point Democratic advantage. In the current poll, that gap has closed to seven points.

  By many political calculations, Silicon Valley should be Al Gore country.

Mr. Bush is outpacing the vice president in contributions here by a 2-to-1 margin, raising $2.1 million to Mr. Gore's $1 million, while remaining neck and neck with him in soft-dollar contributions. And Mr. Bush's list of supporters in the computer-related industry is as gold-plated as Mr. Gore's.

  ''Silicon Valley represents the crosscurrent of money and cool,'' said Gregory W. Slayton, chief executive of ClickAction Inc., an Internet marketing firm, and chairman of Silicon Valley Bush-2000. ''And that's where all politicians want to be.''

 <date>
  10-3-2000

 <textdata>
  And they are. Late last month, for instance, Mr. Bush came to Silicon Valley to campaign at a local school and attend a $1 million fund-raiser at the home of Carol A. Bartz, chief executive of Autodesk Inc., a software company.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A week earlier, Mr. Gore was here for a $3 million fund-raiser at the house in Atherton of Eric Schmidt, chairman and chief executive of Novell Inc. Elton John flew in from London to entertain the 300 guests.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The same day Mr. Gore was here, an advertisement in a local newspaper, The San Jose Mercury News, listed 300 high-technology executives backing Mr. Bush, including officials at Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, Texas Instruments, Microsoft, Intel -- many of whom also participated in a telephone conference call that day with reporters to extol Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What is remarkable about this flurry of activity is that it comes as polls show Mr. Gore comfortably ahead of Mr. Bush in California -- especially in the San Francisco area, including Silicon Valley.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A poll in mid-September by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California had Mr. Gore leading by eight percentage points. It also showed Mr. Gore with 57 percent in the Bay Area, which combines heavily Democratic San Francisco and more-divided Silicon Valley, to Mr. Bush's 28 percent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush camp agreed. ''Everyone wants to associate with the future,'' said Margita Thompson, the Bush campaign's adviser on high technology. ''Silicon Valley is a way of thinking, a way of challenging things and a forward-looking mentality. Governor Bush wants to capture that.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While this effort may not be evident from Mr. Bush's national advertising, it is taking place in a more subtle effort. The Bush campaign set up a office in Redwood City, Calif., and has an e-mail campaign directed at high-technology leaders, especially chief executives.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While Mr. Bush leads in direct donations, overall donations to both parties and candidates -- soft and hard dollars -- split evenly in the Bay Area. San Jose and San Francisco residents contributed $19.3 million overall, giving $10.5 million to Democrats and $8.6 million to Republicans. Moreover, executives of computer-related companies are writing six-digit campaign checks, and one Zip code alone, 94027 in Atherton, accounted for $2.1 million, $1 million to Republicans, $877,025 to Democrats and the rest to political action committees.

  ''For years we stuck our head in the sand,'' said Kim Polese, chairwoman of Marimba, a software company, and a Gore supporter. ''But we've changed. People in the Valley have clicked into politics.''

  Silicon Valley is the bastion of fierce entrepreneurship -- a place where thousands of entrepreneurs have escaped the rigidities of big corporations and struck out alone. And this creates opportunities for Mr. Bush and obstacles for Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For all of his well-known forays into Silicon Valley through the years, Mr. Gore is seen by Republican executives as being close to two institutions despised by Silicon Valley, unions and trial lawyers, and as being emblematic of the type of big government involvement in business the valley abhors. Mr. Gore's troubles contrast with the success President Clinton had attracting Silicon Valley Republicans in 1996.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The underlying interest in Silicon Valley is in leaving business alone,'' said Tom Riley, president of WebState Inc., an online training company, and a Bush supporter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''For the most part,'' Mr. Riley said, ''the success of Silicon Valley has been because people are left on their own with a minimum of interference, red tape and bureaucracy. People here look at Gore and see a bureaucrat, a politician and someone from Washington.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gore supporters disagreed. Silicon Valley's boom, they said, relied heavily on government investment, policies and on federal research grants that helped many of today's best-known corporate names.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They said Mr. Gore has a demonstrated record of backing issues important to Silicon Valley: From programs that helped to create Web browsers and the Internet to backing overhaul of the telecommunications industry, from supporting more government funds for education and research to aiding small businesses market new technologies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We live in a highly networked and connected global economy and public policy matters,'' Mr. Doerr said. ''Al Gore is really a leader in understanding how government should engage with technology.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in offices and coffee cafes here, when talk turns to presidential politics, it is rarely about such specifics but rather about government -- friend or foe. The Bush campaign's involvement in this talk came from early groundwork by executives here who felt Mr. Gore was getting too much attention and made pilgrimages to Austin, Tex.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There was a tremendous amount of frustration among Republicans here that all the gold and glory was going to the Democrats and the area was being portrayed as locked up for Gore,'' said Lezlee Westine, head of TechNet's Republican politics section. As early as 1999, Ms. Westine took executives to Austin, set up a Bush advisory board on technology and put advertisements in California newspapers urging him to run.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One refrain repeated by Bush supporters is government policies had little to do with eight years of economic well-being -- or even the creation of Silicon Valley. ''I've worked in the valley since 1963,'' Mr. Kvamme said, ''and I don't think government ever had a role in it.''
 </textdata>

  ''It's easy to get caught up with being successful here,'' said Justin Kitch, chief executive of Homestead.com, an Internet content company, and Gore backer. ''It's hard to step back and say, 'Why am I so lucky?' Many don't want to attribute their success to any external factors. That's part of being an entrepreneur.''

  Poll Finds Both Candidates Faring Well on Leadership  A New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that most Americans regard Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore as strong leaders, but they consider Mr. Gore far more prepared for the White House and better qualified to deal with world leaders and members of both parties in Congress. But when voters are asked to assess each man on the broader question of his potential to be ''an effective president,'' both candidates receive high marks. The poll also found that Mr. Bush's personal popularity had eroded slightly as Mr. Gore's continued to improve. In terms of voter preferences, Mr. Gore held a narrow lead over Mr. Bush.

  The network has, however, decided to make amends by offering Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore an hour of free air time to respond to the question ''Why should Americans vote for you?'' Extra credit will be given for originality, creative use of props and any reference to the critical problems facing genetically enhanced prototypes.

  Facing off against Mr. Lieberman will be no easy task. Ever since the two men were picked as running mates, Mr. Cheney has been dogged by criticisms that he is not as good a campaigner as Mr. Lieberman, not as charismatic as Mr. Lieberman, not as funny as Mr. Lieberman. But Mr. Cheney's staff is predicting that the candidate will be able to show off a mastery of policy and politics that comes from his 25 years in government as a White House chief of staff,  congressman and President George Bush's secretary of defense during the Persian Gulf war.

  Mr. Lazio appeared yesterday at the Coyne Park Senior Center in Yonkers with promises to maintain Social Security and to find a way to enact a prescription drug plan for the elderly poor. He said he would support a transitional program to provide prescription drug benefits until a permanent one was in place, an idea endorsed by Gov. George W. Bush and Congressional Republicans, who have proposed such legislation.

  More recently, Mr. Letterman invited Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to a debate on his program. The Gore campaign quickly accepted, but the Bush campaign made no commitment, prompting a taunt from Mr. Letterman: ''If you turn it down, see, it makes you look like you're scared, like you're a little girl. Nobody wants a little girl in the White House.''

  In this campaign, Mr. Lieberman has vowed not to say anything negative about Mr. Cheney or Gov. George W. Bush personally, but to limit his attacks to their records -- a promise he has kept so far. He draws an implicit contrast to Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, who have criticized Vice President Al Gore personally, describing him as dishonest.

  ''In some ways it's therapeutic,'' Mr. Lieberman said of the preparations.

  A chart yesterday showing the effect of the presidential candidates' tax plans on 12 hypothetical individuals and families misstated the taxes for one case -- a single parent with three children and an annual income of $29,000.

  The chart also labeled one case incorrectly. The family that would save $2,322 under the Bush plan and $1,038 under the Gore plan was a working couple with three children and an annual income of $39,000 -- not two children and an income of $39,000.

  Florida has been a battleground in the debate over vouchers. Last year, with the support of Gov.

Vice President Al Gore set out to demonstrate that he is neither an attack dog nor a robot, as some who dislike him suggest.  And both worked hard to convince the crucial undecided voters that their programs on education, on taxes and on medical care merit support.

  When it was over, both the Republican and the Democrat had some reason for satisfaction. Amid a welter of conflicting claims and numbers, Mr. Bush had managed to paint Mr. Gore as a Washington insider who would ''increase the size of government substantially,'' and Mr. Gore had tarred the Texan as an advocate of using the federal budget surplus to ''enrich the few, the wealthiest 1 percent.''

  ''I didn't think the debate changed anything fundamental,'' said Drew Lewis, a prominent Pennsylvania Republican who served as transportation secretary in the Reagan administration.

  A Democratic veteran of many campaigns, former Mayor Pete Flaherty of Pittsburgh, said both candidates had spent too much time niggling over details. He said Mr. Bush had looked a bit out of his depth on the Balkans, but credited the governor with an effective rejoinder to the charge that he favors the rich in noting that Mr. Gore's tax plan would save the middle-class Strunks of Allentown $145 and his own would save them $1,800.

  Neither man committed an obvious gaffe; Mr. Bush avoided stumbling over his own syntax or comically mispronouncing words as he had in the past. Clearly less fluent than the vice president, he hesitated at times and gave incomplete replies at others, but on occasion he seemed more spontaneous and less programmed than Mr. Gore. Mr. Bush attacked more directly, accusing his rival of making ''totally false'' statements about his health care proposals, using ''fuzzy math'' and ''phony numbers,'' and ''running on Medi scare.''

  More money has been spent on the presidential race so far in Pennsylvania than in any other state -- in excess of $21 million, one study indicates. The contest here is close, according to the polls, but not so close as in some other states. While they insist that Pennsylvania's 23 electoral votes are still in play, important Bush backers here concede that winning them will probably be harder for the governor than winning Ohio, Michigan or Wisconsin.

  Still, in Pennsylvania as elsewhere, there is a discrepancy between polls. A survey taken last Tuesday through Thursday for The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette showed Mr. Gore up by only four percentage points, 45 to 41, while a new Keystone Poll, taken Thursday through Sunday for a group of media clients in the state, showed him ahead by 12 points, 49 to 37. The director of the Keystone Poll, Bernard Yost of Millersville University, said it showed that voters here ''really do question Bush's intellect.''

  This much, at least, is evident: On Wednesday, both candidates will resume their courtship of the swing states.

Mr. Gore will campaign in Ohio on Wednesday and in Michigan on Thursday.

  Mr. Bush was especially careful tonight when dealing with abortion, a highly divisive issue in Pennsylvania. He made clear his opposition to abortion, but he declined to say either that he would seek as president to reverse the Food and Drug Administration's approval of RU-486, the abortion pill, or that he would nominate opponents of Roe v. Wade to the Supreme Court.

  Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.

  In the first debate of the 2000 presidential campaign, at the University of Massachusetts, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore engaged in blunt condemnations of each other's proposals. Even when attacking, they smiled their way through the 90-minute encounter. They steered clear of personal criticisms until the final few minutes, when Mr. Bush questioned the vice president's credibility and his involvement in the campaign fund-raising scandals of 1996.

  Neither candidate mentioned President Clinton, but from the opening of the debate to its last moments, Mr. Bush criticized the vice president as part of an administration that squandered its opportunities to make progress on issues like prescription drugs and Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Portraying himself as governor of a large state who effectively reached out to Republicans and Democrats alike, Mr. Bush assailed Mr. Gore as deeply entrenched in a poll-driven Washington culture that had little to show for itself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I fully recognize I'm not of Washington,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I'm from Texas. And he's got a lot of experience. But so do I. And I've been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union. I've had a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In delivering their pitches, both contenders offered distinct philosophies as to how they would approach governing and the presidency. Mr. Gore spoke of proposals that would help Americans at every income level and embraced views favored by liberals, like abortion rights and protecting the environment.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush unabashedly referred to conservative principles and underscored his party's long-held tenets that the federal government is too powerful and that the military needs to be strengthened. But his muted response to questions about abortion made it clear that he, like Mr. Gore, was making his case to the sliver of swing voters likely to determine the outcome of the race.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said his opponent had accomplished little in his eight years in office. ''Look,'' he said, ''let's forget all the politics and all the finger-pointing and get some positive things done on Medicare and prescription drugs and Social Security.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore, not wanting to invoke Mr. Clinton, refrained from agressively defending the administration,  instead turning his fire on Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a phrase he repeated again and again, Mr. Gore asserted that the Texas governor's tax plan was tilted to the rich. ''He would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Now, I think those are wrong priorities.'' He mentioned the ''wealthiest 1 percent'' 10 times during the debate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In response, Mr. Bush said tartly said that the vice president was guilty of ''fuzzy math'' and trying to ''scare'' the people with inaccurate depictions of his proposals. ''This man is running on 'Medi-scare,' '' Mr. Bush said after Mr. Gore asserted that under the governor's Medicare prescription drug plan ''95 percent of all seniors'' would get no assistance for four or five years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both candidates, the scions of famous political fathers, tried to show good humor throughout the debate. The vice president spoke somewhat hurriedly and seemed determined to keep a pleasant demeanor. At several points Mr. Gore sighed loudly at Mr. Bush's answers. When Mr. Bush voiced positions that the vice president agreed with, Mr. Gore noted their agreement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore often appeared calm but still jumped in constantly, betraying his eagerness to debate. He knowingly violated the rules, saying, ''I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions'' and proceeded to ask one of Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was on the attack from the outset and proved much more assertive about the vice president's vulnerabilities than Mr. Gore was about the governor's. But Mr. Bush, who has far less debating experience than the vice president, seemed more at ease and less scripted than he did in most of his encounters during the Republican primaries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mindful, perhaps, that voters do tire of negative politics and personal attacks -- and that they sometimes backfire -- Mr. Bush resisted references to Mr. Clinton and his administration's scandals. And Mr. Gore, seeking not to appear mean-spirited, did not dwell on what for months he and his campaign have assailed as failures in Mr. Bush's Texas record.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in the closing minutes of the debate, Jim Lehrer of PBS, the moderator, asked Mr. Bush about Mr. Gore's ethical conduct, and the governor jumped at the opportunity.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After crediting Mr. Gore for loving his wife and family, Mr. Bush referred pointedly to the vice president's explanation for his involvement in a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple. ''The thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, 'No controlling legal authority.' I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House. I believe they've moved that sign 'the buck stops here' on the Lincoln Bedroom, and that's not good for the country. It's not right.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He did not stop there. ''I don't know the man well,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but I have been disappointed about how he and his administration has conducted the fund-raising affairs. You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fund-raiser is just not my view of responsibility.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  As they stood side by side at lecterns in a red-carpeted gymnasium here, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush tangled over strikingly different visions -- and prescriptions -- on major issues of the day as they were questioned by Mr. Lehrer.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the issue of RU-486, a newly approved abortion drug, Mr. Bush, who opposes abortion, first tried to play down the difference between himself and Mr. Gore. He said he did not believe as president he would have the power to overturn the decision last week by the Food and Drug Administration to legalize the drug.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush said that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who ''look at the Constitution as sacred'' and that he believed in ''strict constructionists.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore sought to sharpen their differences on abortion by warning that Mr. Bush had said he would make appointments in the mold of the court's two staunchest conservatives, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The vice president said of Mr. Bush's references to strict constructionists, ''Those are code words'' for choosing justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said he would consider using troops to prevent mass killings. Mr. Bush said he would not use force to promote ''nation building.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>

  Questioned about what he would do about Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to step down as president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Mr. Gore said of the elections there last week, ''We should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia -- as they call Serbia plus Montenegro.'' That support, he said, should include the prospect of lifted sanctions, which would be ''a very strong incentive that we have given them to do the right thing.''

  Mr. Bush said it was ''time for the man to leave.'' But when he suggested that the Russians should ''step up and lead,'' playing a prominent role in mediating the outcome of the elections, Mr. Gore demurred, saying, ''We might not like the result that comes out of that.''

  The candidates clashed at length about their rival plans to offer prescription drug insurance for older Americans and about who would stand up to special interests. Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush's remedies were too tied to corporations. ''Big drug companies support Governor Bush's prescription drug proposal,'' he said. ''They oppose mine.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush then grimaced, and offered a swift rebuttal, mentioning two groups that have contributed generously to the vice president. ''I've been standing up to big Hollywood and big trial lawyers,'' he said.

  Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush approached tonight's event with somewhat opposite objectives: Mr. Gore, who already is viewed by many Americans as having more command of the issues, sought to display a sunnier side and not portray himself as a slashing, even mean-spirited candidate, as sometimes happened in his debates in the Democratic primaries. Mr. Bush, by contrast, tried to underscore his command of the issues and his comfort in policy. At first blush, he did not seem to commit any blunders, although he was at times less facile than Mr. Gore in his responses.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  The event was unusual in that in many presidential debates in recent years, the two candidates knew each other or had at least been photographed together. The candidates of four years ago, for example, President Clinton and Bob Dole, had appeared dozens of times together to hammer out legislation. But both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have said they do not know each other. Mr. Bush said recently that he met his opponent eight years ago.

  Tonight's debate was the most traditional of the three. On Tuesday, in Winston-Salem, N.C., the two men will sit at a table with Mr. Lehrer. On Oct. 17, the format will be a town meeting, where citizens can pose questions to Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore.

  As recently as a month ago, it appeared that the first presidential debate would not even take place in Boston. Advisers to Mr. Bush balked at the notion of having the event in such a Democratic state, and at a site that is nearby the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. But faced with criticism that he was trying to avoid debates, Mr. Bush relented on his objections about the sites.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Outside the library complex, though, there was nary a sign of a Bush supporter. Several thousand protesters amassed, mostly union supporters in work boots but with a strong contingent of pierced young supporters of Mr. Nader.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  With no Republicans to argue with, some of the Nader supporters and Gore supporters took to arguing with each other. The most common chant was, ''Let Ralph debate!''

  THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW  Correction:  October 6, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, a phrase was omitted in some editions on Wednesday, altering the meaning, in a front-page article about the debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. As written, the article said the confrontation took on greater significance because the contest was ''disturbingly close FOR BOTH CANDIDATES.''

  Bush and Gore Face Off In First Campaign Debate  Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush met in Boston for their first presidential debate, arguing over issues that included taxes, health care and foreign policy.

  It was not enough for Vice President Al Gore to venture a crisp pronunciation of Milosevic, as in Slobodan, the Yugoslav president who refuses to be pried from power.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000

  And as Mr. Gore loped effortlessly through the Balkans, barely able to suppress his self-satisfied grin, it became ever clearer that the point of all the thickets of consonants and proper nouns was not a geopolitical lesson.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The conventional wisdom held that in tonight's presidential debate, the first, and perhaps most important, of three encounters between Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, Mr. Gore should show voters a warm and fuzzy side while Mr. Bush should seize a tough, commanding tone.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But neither man could resist reverting to type: in Mr. Gore's case, the man who loves to show off how much he knows; in Mr. Bush's case, the man who would rather sidestep the bogs of detailed policy to get to the meadows of emotional pronouncements.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush even told a story about a flood-devastated family in Texas with whom he had cried.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And despite Mr. Bush's frequent stabs at specificity, he just as often clung to broad statements of good intent, using questions as springboards for practiced assertions that he would be a good leader, bring people together and care.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore lunged for his speaking time, and quickly crammed it with words.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush ambled up to his, shaking his head at the behavior of his opponent, which he clearly wanted voters to deem overbearing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has always presented himself as the more affable man, and he pulled off a small victory at the start of the debate to buttress that claim. Walking onto the stage, he strode past his own lectern and right up to Mr. Gore's, which was where they shook hands. It made Mr. Bush seem more eager to exchange good wishes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore had long endured criticism for his readiness to score points with sad stories about his relatives, but here he was, bringing yet another family member into the fray.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush had long endured criticism for his vagueness, but here he was, using an all-purpose sound bite to rebut a charge by Mr. Gore that he would not provide elderly people with a prescription-drug benefit quickly enough.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I guess my answer to that is, the man's running on 'Mediscare,' trying to frighten people in the in the voting booth,'' Mr. Bush said. That stutter crept into many of his answers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  True to form, Mr. Bush mixed up some words, saying that elderly people dependent on Social Security should rest assured that their promises would be ''made,'' not kept.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  True to form, Mr. Gore adopted the lexicon of a teacher.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore attacked, firing the same bullet over and over: that the ''wealthiest 1 percent'' of Americans would get more money in tax cuts from Mr. Bush than Mr. Bush would spend on social programs for less privileged Americans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush played the nice guy taken aback by such aggression, wondering again and again why Mr. Gore would indulge in so much ''fuzzy math.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore kept digressing to explain things, as if Mr. Bush needed the tutorials. Mr. Bush kept telling voters to listen to his own words and not Mr. Gore's characterizations of them, as if nothing Mr. Gore said could be trusted.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore recalled little encounters from his past.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush either got a little confused or pretended that he did, displaying a softness of focus and good humor in response to a question about how, as president, he might deal with emergencies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I've been standing up to big Hollywood, to big trial lawyers,'' Mr. Bush began, then stopped himself, breaking into a grin. ''What was the question? It was about emergencies, wasn't it?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Well, that depended on whether a reporter sought the answer under the big placard that read ''Alexis Herman,'' the secretary of labor, who was on hand to sing Mr. Gore's praises, or under the one that read ''Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn,''  Republican of Washington, on hand to talk up Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was the ultimate illustration of just how much importance both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush placed on this event. But while the stakes were bigger than ever, the candidates, to some extent, were the same as always.
 </textdata>

  Even before Al Gore and George W. Bush opened their mouths, Kevin Wiland formed an impression of them. He thought Governor Bush looked stiff and formal as he walked onto the stage, ''with broad shoulders and chin up,'' Mr. Wiland said. ''Gore seems a little more relaxed, which is different than they usually are.''

He thought Governor Bush looked stiff and formal as he walked onto the stage, ''with broad shoulders and chin up,'' Mr. Wiland said. ''Gore seems a little more relaxed, which is different than they usually are.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  From the first question to Mr. Gore about Mr. Bush's fitness to be president, Mr. Wiland said he liked the way the vice president passed up an opportunity to ''slash his opponent,'' adding, ''He was more positive.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By contrast, Mr. Wiland did not like what he called ''those little jabs'' that Mr. Bush was making, his repeated accusation that Mr. Gore was using ''fuzzy numbers'' and his comment that Mr. Gore had not only invented the Internet, but had also invented the calculator.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Wiland was impressed with the way Governor Bush handled the question about whether he would overturn the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the abortion pill, RU-486.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I liked his answer a lot,'' Mr. Wiland said. ''He said that a president couldn't overrule it. He's not looking to make radical changes on the issue. I am also against partial-birth abortions,'' as Mr. Bush said he was.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Wiland felt Governor Bush dodged the question on whether he would appoint Supreme Court justices who opposed legalized abortion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the questions about the military, Mr. Wiland liked that Mr. Bush said he would be careful about using the military to intervene in foreign countries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Good,'' Mr. Wiland said, while Mr. Bush was talking. ''I agree with everything he just said.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But later he said, ''I'm comfortable with both of them as my commander in chief. They're both going to get top advisers to help them make decisions. Gore was in the military. Bush has got a good vice president and a good father. They're both going to be reluctant to put forces out.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He thought Mr. Gore's anecdotes about people in the audience were effective. And he thought that Mr. Bush was ''playing on the strongest card he has, which is to take an incumbent party and say you haven't done enough. But I don't know if I buy it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And so it went, over sangria and cider. Mostly, they were Democrats and supporters of the vice president. Still, Mr. Gore's speech held a discomfiting surprise or two for Jonathan Marcus, an unequivocal Gore backer, such as when the vice president volunteered his opposition to late-term abortion. ''It seemed like he reached out of discussion a little bit as a grab for the middle,'' he observed. Neither that comment, nor the rest of Mr. Gore's performance tonight weakened his support for the vice president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But if there were no George W. Bush enthusiasts here, there were also plenty of people who, like Mr. Milstein, were not sold on Mr. Gore either. ''This is definitely an election of the lesser of two evils,'' Mr. Milstein said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Clinton, he had a vision in a way,'' he added. ''Gore doesn't have that. Bush doesn't have that. In the end, either of them are probably capable. But this is the product of not developing leaders in the last 30 years. So you get these kinds of options.''

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000

  Mr. Bush favored large tax cuts, Mr. Gore more federal spending. Mr. Gore stood for abortion rights, Mr. Bush did not. Mr. Gore advocated expanding Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Bush pressed for partial privatization of the programs.

 <textdata>
  On education, Mr. Bush stressed his plan to have students tested annually and to hold the public schools accountable if the students did not score well.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore emphasized the money he would spend to hire teachers, raise teachers' salaries and give parents tax breaks to help offset the cost of college tuition.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The governor talked more about local control of schools; Mr. Gore talked about how he would use federal funds to help reduce class size.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of favoring vouchers -- money to parents for private school tuition -- and said money should never be taken away from public schools.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush did not rise to the bait and avoided using the term vouchers. But he said would give parents money for private schools if testing showed over several years that the public schools were not serving the children adequately.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Neither candidate accepted the idea that the only way to preserve Social Security is to raise taxes or cut benefits. Mr. Gore said he would continue the current benefit levels and provide government matching funds to help workers set up retirement accounts above and beyond Social Security. Mr. Bush would turn to a partial privatization of the system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush accused Mr. Gore of having no strategy for saving Social Security when the present funds expire. Mr. Bush would use about 15 percent of Social Security taxes to let workers set up private retirement accounts. The problem with the Bush plan, in Mr. Gore's view, is that insufficient money would be available for current benefit levels.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In an important new book, ''Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms'' (Simon &amp; Schuster), Diane Ravitch, a historian and former education official in the Bush administration, suggests that, at least in the United States, this lack of mobility was not inevitable. A choice was made to deny immigrant and working-class children education to rise above their parents' stations. They were taught only vocational skills, with academic instruction reserved for the middle class.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore started their discussion from a point of agreement: They said troops should be committed only to those places where American interests and security were at stake. But they defined those interests differently.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000

  Mr. Gore seemed to indicate that sometimes the United States would need to put itself at risk to prevent a humanitarian disaster.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both agreed that they would not send troops to Serbia to oust President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. Mr. Bush said that he would use diplomacy, and get Russia to tell Mr. Milosevic that the time has come for him to surrender his office in the wake of his defeat in an election last week. Mr. Gore shot back that Russia has not yet agreed that Mr. Milosevic should leave office without a runoff election.

  Mr. Gore repeatedly attacked Mr. Bush for proposing a tax cut, amounting to $1.3 trillion over nine years starting in 2002, that would provide more money to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans than Mr. Bush has proposed to spend on education, health care, prescription drug coverage for the elderly and national defense combined.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's numbers were basically correct. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group, 42.6 percent of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, when they are fully phased in, would go to the top 1 percent of households by income, those making $319,000 a year or more.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If that percentage were applied to the $1.3 trillion pricetag that Mr. Bush put on his tax plan, it would mean that $554 billion would go to the wealthiest 1 percent. Mr. Bush's proposal calls for $475 billion in additional spending over 10 years on the areas cited by Mr. Gore and others.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush responded that his tax plan would actually result in the wealthiest taxpayers shouldering a bigger portion of the tax burden. His assertion was based on an analysis done by his economic advisers that showed that people at lower income levels would get a larger tax income tax cut in percentage terms, though not in dollar terms, than people at higher income levels.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The analysis showed that people earning $200,000 or more would pay 40.9 percent of all income taxes under the Bush plan, compared to 39.1 percent under current law. The analysis covered only income taxes, and therefore excluded the effects of Mr. Bush's proposal to repeal the federal tax on large estates, those valued at $675,000 or more.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said 50 million people, including anyone who is single and people above certain income thresholds, would receive no benefits from Mr. Gore's $480 billion tax cut plan.  The Gore campaign disputed Mr. Bush's figure but could not provide an estimate of its own.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said his plan would split the projected surplus among additional spending, tax cuts and shoring up Social Security. He said he would use half the surplus for Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said he would use a quarter of the surplus for ''important projects.'' The remaining quarter, he said, would go to his tax cut. At $1.3 trillion, his tax cut actually would use up 28.5 percent of the surplus.

  The couple, Robert Montemayor, senior vice president for BPI Communications, and his wife, Virginia Lujano, director of new media sales and marketing for Contentville.com, an Internet company, said they were leaning toward Mr. Gore before the debate. They were not swayed by the end.

  The couple, Robert Montemayor, senior vice president for BPI Communications, and his wife, Virginia Lujano, director of new media sales and marketing for Contentville.com, an Internet company, said they were leaning toward Mr. Gore before the debate. They were not swayed by the end.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But after less than 30 minutes, they said that Mr. Bush seemed more tense than his opponent. When the governor said ''it seems like the vice president is not right too many times tonight,'' the three looked at one another.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He's too nervous,'' Ms. Lujano said. At one point, she said Mr. Bush was being ''snappy.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Lujano gasped when Mr. Bush said, ''I believe abortions ought to be more rare in America.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And when Mr. Gore said ''I support a woman's right to choose,'' Mr. Montemayor nodded. ''That's the best thing he's said all night,'' he said, and Mr. Salvato agreed that the statement would win him a lot of votes with women.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The trio thought both candidates were getting bogged down in too much detail about their opposing plans, but Mr. Montemayor thought Mr. Gore had more of a tendency to drone on.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>

  ''You've got to give old Bush something, he sure is more brief and to the point in his answers,'' he said.

  As the debate began tonight, Mr. Ali had not yet decided whether he would follow family tradition and vote for the Democrat, Vice President Al Gore, or break his grandmother's heart and vote for the Republican governor of Texas, George W. Bush.

  ''Bush doesn't look comfortable at all,'' he said. ''Look, he's the first one to take a drink of water. This reminds me of the Nixon-Kennedy debate. Gore looks like his own man and Bush looks a little lost.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Ali said he supported Mr. Bush on abortion issues and he felt that Mr. Bush scored points with his ''clear articulation on education issues.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  But over, Mr. Ali said, Mr. Bush ''struggled'' throughout the night.''
 </textdata>

  An hour into the debate, Mr. Ali declared,  ''Gore is killing Bush, from foreign policy to financial matters.''

  Mr. Bush favored large tax cuts, Mr. Gore more federal spending. Mr. Gore stood for abortion rights, Mr. Bush did not. Mr. Gore advocated expanding Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Bush pressed for partial privatization of the programs.

  The candidates clashed early and fiercely over how to provide prescription drug coverage to older Americans. Mr. Bush accused Mr. Gore of using ''Medi-scare tactics,'' while Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of advancing a plan that offered little or no help to most Medicare beneficiaries and was far too reliant on private insurance.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush advocated transforming the government health insurance program into a largely private marketplace in which the elderly are given a fixed amount of money each year and can purchase the plan of their choice. He noted that the traditional Medicare program would be preserved and that the elderly could stay with the program if they chose.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore's plan, like Mr. Bush's, would make it substantially more expensive for those who want to stay with traditional Medicare.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Under Mr. Bush's proposal, health plans would be required to offer drug coverage. Low-income seniors would get immediate help, he argued, under a four-year, $48 billion program of grants to the states.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said that this plan would be limited to the low-income elderly, and that 95 percent of older Americans would ''get no help whatsoever under my opponent's plan for the  first four or five years.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore advocated adding a standard drug benefit to the Medicare program: it would be voluntary, available for a monthly premium beginning at $25 and gradually doubling over a decade. It would cover about half the costs of drugs up to a cap that gradually rises to $5,000. He proposed a 50 percent federal subsidy of the premiums; Mr. Bush proposed 25 percent.

  After sparring for months from a safe distance, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush confronted each other last night in an intense, sometimes barely polite televised debate over health care, tax cuts, defense spending, campaign finance and other issues at the center of their presidential race. At times viewers may have felt lost in a blizzard of details, but certain overriding impressions came through. Mr. Gore came across as a candidate with ambitious government solutions who looked more confident and knowledgeable on the attack, and Mr. Bush as a Washington outsider who hopes to stir public resistance to what he said was the vice president's partisan, big-government approach.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There had been talk before the encounter, at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, that Mr. Gore would temper his famously confrontational debating style. But after an initially flat recitation of his health care ideas, the vice president fired volley after volley of attacks on Mr. Bush's proposals, throwing his opponent on the defensive and forcing him to rely on canned attack lines about Mr. Gore's ''fuzzy numbers'' and ''Medi-scare tactics.'' The Texas governor countered not by answering in kind, but by presenting himself as a practical and reform-minded Washington outsider who could solve problems instead of exploiting them.

 </date>
 <textdata>
  On protecting the environment and abortion rights, the vice president also kept up his attacks, while Mr. Bush sought to transcend the policy exchanges by emphasizing his personal leadership abilities. He spoke in a clipped, folksy manner, but whether he overcame what some polls show to be doubts about his abilities may not be clear for a while. In any event, he fell short of making a compelling case for a radical change in policy in Washington despite repeated assertions that the current administration had failed to govern effectively.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The debate gave viewers a chance to step beyond polls and media analysis and assess the knowledge and presentational skills of the two candidates on their own before making up their minds. The television accounts are sure to repeat selected lively passages, but there were surprisingly few of the usual memorable lines or zingers that the public often remembers from debates. Instead the powerful impression was of two advocates of different views of government. On taxes, for example, they repeated their campaign formulas, with Mr. Bush charging that Mr. Gore's tax cut program awarded its benefits selectively only to the ''right'' Americans willing to take advantage of its narrowly crafted incentives. The vice president hammered tellingly on a favorite theme -- that the governor's tax program awarded more money to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans than it set aside for health, education and defense spending.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As they toured a range of issues, Mr. Gore seemed most at home and Mr. Bush most tentative on subjects that required deep Washington experience. On foreign policy and the national security responsibilities of the president, Mr. Gore offered more nuanced answers, while Mr. Bush fell back on generalities about principles of decision making. The same pattern prevailed in a discussion of managing international financial crises, while Mr. Bush seemed more sure of his footing on subjects like domestic education.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore dodged serious damage on one of his key vulnerabilities. The Republican nominee assailed him for the Democrats' 1996 campaign finance abuses and repeatedly rebuffed the vice president's responses by saying he had no credibility on the issue. But Mr. Gore spoke passionately on behalf of campaign finance reform, declaring that all other legislative initiatives would be hobbled if the system for financing Congressional and presidential campaigns was not cleaned up to eliminate the power of special interests.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This was a debate free of major gaffes or knockout punches. Both men head to the next two encounters without disabling wounds. The biggest gain for Mr. Bush last night was that he did not crumble under the pressure of the sternest test to date of his presidential potential, even though questions will persist about his depth of knowledge. Mr. Gore displayed his command of issues and his steadiness in the arena, although he sometimes seemed drawn back to the hectoring style that bothers some voters. It was, on substance, a more impressive night for Mr. Gore, but the final scorecard still belongs to the voters.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His wife, Diane Gallen, 44, a lifelong Democrat and former intensive-care unit nurse, also said, ''I don't think there was a winner.'' Ms. Gallen said she would probably  vote for Mr. Gore, and what criticisms she did have of the candidates' performances were mostly reserved for Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Mr. Bush attacked Mr. Gore for his fund-raising practices in an effort to question his character, Mrs. Gallen said, ''That's a little hypocritical of him,'' given Mr. Bush's own huge fund-raising operation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  She also mocked Mr. Bush when he promised that he would protect Social Security, saying, ''Hear me loud and clear.'' Mrs. Gallen said it reminded her of the ''Read my lips, no new taxes,'' pledge by Mr. Bush's father, former President George Bush,
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Likewise, Tom Coveney, a 42-year-old banker who normally voted Republican, did not feel either man changed his mind, though he expressed resentment at Mr. Gore's repeated claims that Mr. Bush was trying to cut the taxes of the richest 1 percent of Americans. ''They're the people who earn the money,'' Mr. Coveney said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To Mr. Coveney, Mr. Gore had more facts and was a master ''policy wonk,'' but he also tired of the vice president's constant use of complex policy answers. ''He's like the kid in school you wanted to beat up because he knows all the answers,'' Mr. Coveney said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dr. Gallen and his wife were more impressed with Mr. Gore's answers on national security, saying the vice president sounded more like a leader. And Mrs. Gallen was scornful of Mr. Bush's guarded answers about the abortion-inducing drug, mifepristone, and about what judges he would appoint to the Supreme Court. The governor was giving ''a coached answer,'' she said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dr. Gallen was more critical: ''Bush got a black eye on that. Gore beat him up, because he can't tell the truth.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Coveney thought Mr. Bush's answers on abortion were wisely calculated.

  MR. LEHRER -- Good evening from the Clark Athletic Center at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. I'm Jim Lehrer of ''The News Hour'' on PBS and I welcome you to the first of three 90-minute debates between the Democratic candidate for president, Vice President Al Gore, and the Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The candidates under their rules may not question each other directly. There will be no opening statements but each candidate may have up to two minutes for a closing statement. The questions and the subjects were chosen by me alone. I have told no one from the two campaigns or the commission or anyone else involved what they are. There's a small audience in the hall tonight. They are not here to participate, only to listen. I have asked and they have agreed to remain silent for the next 90 minutes except for right now when they will applaud as we welcome the two candidates, Governor Bush and Vice President Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And now the first question. As determined by a flip of a coin it goes to Vice President Gore. Vice President Gore, you have questioned whether Governor Bush has the experience to be president of the United States. What exactly do you mean?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE  Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate. I'd like to thank Governor Bush for participating and I'd like to say that I'm happy to be with Tipper and our family.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience. I have questioned his proposals and here's why. I think this is a very important moment for our country. We have achieved extraordinary prosperity and in this election America has to make an important choice: will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families? I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  Governor Bush, one-minute rebuttal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  So I take it by your answer then, Mr. Vice President, that in your interview recently with The New York Times when you said that you question whether or not Governor Bush was experienced enough to be president, you were talking about strictly policy differences.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Under Governor Bush's tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined. Now I think those are the wrong priorities.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  Let me just follow up. One quick question. When you hear Vice President Gore question your experience, do you read it the same way? That he's talking about policy differences only?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  Governor Bush, you have questioned -- this is a companion question to the question I asked Vice President Gore. You have questioned whether Vice President Gore has demonstrated the leadership qualities necessary to be president of the United States. What do you mean by that?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an H.M.O. or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage. But there'd be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE  Yeah. I mean, it's just clear, you can go to the Web site and look, if you make more than $25,000 a year, you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years and then you're pushed into a Medicare, into an H.M.O. or an insurance company plan and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions. And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  New question. Vice President Gore, how would you contrast your approach to preventing future, future oil price and supply problems like we have now to the approach of Governor Bush?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up our, some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months worth of oil and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future. And I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  Governor Bush, one minute.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  So if somebody is watching tonight, listening to what the two of you just said, is it fair to say, O.K., the differences between Vice President Gore and George W. Bush -- Governor Bush -- are the following. You are for doing something on the consumption end, you're for doing something on the production and drilling --
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE  I -- I'm, let me clarify. I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side, and on the consumption side. And let me say that I found one thing in Governor Bush's answer that we certainly agree on and that's the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, and I commend you for supporting that. I worked to -- to -- to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago and to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the Northeast.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  Governor Bush, if elected president, would you try to overturn the F.D.A.'s approval last week of the abortion pill RU-486?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And that's not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision's going to be overturned. I support a woman's right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three, maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the antichoice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  Governor Bush, one minute.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  I -- if you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world. In fact, in my 10-year budget proposal I have set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE  I think one of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to re-establish the old-fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the water's edge. When I was in the United States Congress, I worked with former President Reagan to modernize our strategic weaponry and to pursue arms control in a responsible way. When I was in the United States Senate, I worked with former President Bush, your father, and was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf War. I think bipartisanship is a national asset and we have to find ways to re-establish it in foreign policy and national security policy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said, under Governor Bush's plan go to the wealthiest 1 percent. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices. I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on H.M.O.s and insurance companies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now the priorities are just very different. I'll give you a couple of examples. For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends three dollars for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1  percent. Now for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he's spends five dollars on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent. Those are very clear differences.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  All right, having cleared that up, we're going to a new question: education. Governor Bush, both of you have promised dramatically -- to change dramatically public education in this country. But of the public money spent on education, only 6 percent of it is federal money. You want to change 100 percent of public education with 6 percent of the money. Is that possible?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE  Look, we agreed on a couple of things on education. I strongly support new accountability; so does Governor Bush. I strongly support local control; so does Governor Bush. I'm in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance, every school, every school district, have every state test the -- the children. I've also proposed voluntary national tests from the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing that the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested, including in the subjects that they teach. We've got to recruit 100,000 new teachers and I have budgeted for that. We've got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher. We ought to have universal preschool. And we ought to make college tuition tax deductible up to $10,000 a year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE  Well first of all, I do have mandatory testing. I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national test is in addition to the mandatory testing that we will require of states -- all schools, all school districts, students themselves and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers, which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don't have to take all applicants.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  I cast my lot with the people, even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the policies and the laws to their advantage. That's -- you can see it in this campaign. The big drug companies support Governor Bush's prescription drug proposal. They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors, who currently pay the highest prices of all.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  Governor Bush?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. BUSH  No, there's no difference on that. There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant. I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy. I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship. And that's the role of government, it's to encourage that. But in terms of the response to the question, no.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration. In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers, it is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago. Now, the -- the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER  Governor Bush, are there issues of character that distinguish you from Vice President Gore?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And incidentally, one of them is this. This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party. And that's one of the reasons I've said before, and I'll pledge here tonight, if I'm president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. And the reason it's that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patients bill of rights to take the decisions away from the H.M.O.'s and give them to the doctors and nurses opposed by the H.M.O.'s and insurance companies, all of these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people. And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in -- in endorsing the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.

  MR. GORE  Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility. And I am not going to respond in kind. I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other. And one of the serious problems -- hear me well -- is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money. We have to get a handle on it. And, like John McCain, I have learned from experience. And it's not a new position for me. Twenty-four years ago, I supported full public financing of all federal elections. And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it'll be the first bill I send to the Congress, I want you to know --

  In a campaign that has been wallowing in soft-focus talk-show television, the first face-to-face debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush was the most rigidly formatted of their three planned meetings, and as a result the candidates' demeanors were often as stiff as the lecterns they stood behind.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Though they flung tough accusations at each other, their cautious styles suggested that they were getting this most stiffly presidential (and least Oprah-like) of the debates out of the way. It was the Bush campaign that tried to replace this traditional format with more freewheeling alternatives, but as it turned out, the staid approach worked to neither candidate's advantage.

  The pre-debate spin was that Mr. Gore had to avoid going on a harsh attack that might alienate viewers. He went after Mr. Bush's ideas, but his restraint meant he could not capitalize on the more dynamic image he had been building since the conventions.

  Mr. Bush had to avoid fumbling his words and stretching his answers to fill the time, weaknesses he displayed in the Republican primary debates. The shadow of those early debates only threatened seriously when he seemed to struggle pronouncing Slobodan Milosevic's last name, and to vamp to fill his time when asked how the United States should respond to Mr. Milosevic's refusal to concede the Yugoslav election. The Russians should use their influence, he said at the start and at the end of his answer.

  At times the candidates appeared on a split screen so viewers could see the opponent's reactions, but how and when the two were displayed side by side differed among networks. A pool camera fed several images to the networks, and the individual directors chose how to use them. This had the subtle effect of interrupting the candidates' sincerest looks into the camera (Mr. Bush seemed especially conscious of doing this).
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Throughout the debate, Mr. Bush had more canned lines (he accused Mr. Gore of having ''fuzzy math'' several times), drank more water, sniffed and twisted up his mouth. Mr. Gore sighed, shook his head, was less physically active and came equipped with his own stock phrases (he would put ''Social Security in a lockbox,'' he said).

  Even the network commentators, usually so ready to declare a winner in the presidential horse race, were skittish after this one. ''Gore did better in the debate; Bush got a bigger boost,'' said Bill Schneider of CNN. Instant polls by CNN and ABC, among others, suggested little movement in voters' opinions after the debate. After days of shouting that this might be the decisive moment in the campaign, the commentators seemed like the little boy who cried wolf. Next time they'll say, this is the decisive moment, we mean it.

  Today, policy makers are striving to work with market forces instead of fighting them. In the debate over President Clinton's decision last month to release 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, for example, critics -- led by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas -- derided the move as an improper intrusion of politics into the marketplace. And compared to Nixon-  and Carter-era controls, it was a tame step.

  The energy proposals that Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, brought out last week -- including opening part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploration and incentives to promote coal and nuclear power -- could test the willingness of Americans to rebalance environmental and energy priorities in the face of higher prices. For his part, Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, favors investments in mass transit and incentives to encourage the use of more fuel-efficient vehicles and alternative energy sources.

  The current structure of the market still allows for collusive practices; the whole purpose of OPEC is to control supply and, as a result, prices. In the United States, the F.T.C. is investigating complaints by Mr. Gore and other politicians that refiners this summer may have fixed prices in the Midwest -- accusations the industry has hotly denied.

  Helping elderly people pay for their medicine is a hot topic in presidential politics; in the debate on Tuesday, the candidates clashed repeatedly over how to accomplish that. The companies, fearing that a government-run plan would lead to price controls, are siding squarely with Gov. George Bush of Texas and other Republicans who want to keep the government out of the drug insurance business.

  Vice President Al Gore today intensified a foreign policy argument with George W. Bush that began during their debate on Tuesday, arguing that his vision of using the American military to build new democracies after peace is won has its roots in the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Western Europe after World War II.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's argument that using the military in that role was endangering its essential function, Mr. Gore suggested, ignored the lessons of a postwar policy that he credited not only with saving a war-ravaged continent but also with building prosperity and, ultimately, reuniting Germany under democracy after the collapse of Communism.

  ''It's not a new mission,'' Mr. Gore insisted, when asked about Mr. Bush's criticism that American military preparedness has suffered because troops are overdeployed around the world, often for nonmilitary tasks. ''The generation that won World War II, having seen the catastrophe of the interwar period of the '20s and '30s, wisely decided that nation-building was a preferable alternative to World War III.''

  The Marshall Plan, announced shortly after the war by Secretary of State George C. Marshall, was an economic reconstruction effort for Western Europe and involved aid, not troops. But in Japan and to some extent in Germany, the American occupation forces helped build a court and legislative system, drafting laws and running local governments, as well as providing security. Mr. Gore was suggesting that that was an appropriate model, on a smaller scale, for American troops in Bosnia and Kosovo.

  The vice president spoke today in an hourlong interview on foreign policy in response to a request sent several weeks ago to both major party candidates to talk about how the United States should use its military, financial and diplomatic power abroad. Mr. Bush's aides have said they are considering the request, but have not set a date.

  In his interview, Mr. Gore also said that if he was elected, he would refuse to lift most sanctions on Cuba until Fidel Castro died or was removed from office. When it was suggested that the next president might have to deal with a change of regime in Havana, Mr. Gore shot back, ''I hope so.'' He described himself as a ''hard-liner on Cuba.''

  In a survey of world trouble spots, Mr. Gore also said that as president he would step up efforts to help the Iraqi opposition to President Saddam Hussein -- though he declined to say if the aid would be overt or covert -- and he was sharply critical of Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, for efforts to harass the country's newspapers and crack down in Chechnya. He also spoke at length about his growing concern that Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, was on the brink of chaos, but conceded that he had yet to explore options about how the United States could stabilize the country.

  Historically, foreign policy plays a major role in presidential elections only during times of crisis, most notably in the 1968 contest at the height of the Vietnam War and in the 1980 election, during the Iran hostage crisis. In today's interview, Mr. Gore noted that ''even in our increasingly interdependent world,'' where foreign economic crises affect agricultural markets, and when oil supplies are once again a major issue, ''foreign policy is still not usually on the front burner for most people.'' Indeed, at a rally here in Ohio today just before his interview, he never mentioned international issues, and he rarely does from the stump.

  ''The cliche that you often hear is that it can't help you but it can hurt you,'' he said. ''I'm not sure that's true.'' His advisers, when speaking on background, often describe Mr. Gore's knowledge of the world in an effort to make the case that he is more suited for the presidency than is Mr. Bush. Mr. Gore himself, earlier this year, described Mr. Bush as ''noticeably blank'' on issues of foreign policy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore avoided such criticisms today. But, looking relaxed as he settled into a wingback chair next to a fireplace at a hotel here, he used every opportunity to display the fruits of seven years of daily intelligence briefings. He talked about the nature of the rebellions in Aceh, an Indonesian province, differentiated among the Iraqi groups opposing Mr. Hussein, and discussed at length his conversations with Jiang Zemin, China's president, about Beijing's efforts to control Internet traffic.

  Mr. Gore used the discussion of when he would deploy the military to draw sharp contrasts with Mr. Bush, saying it was ''one area where Governor Bush and I part ways.'' He suggested, as he did on Tuesday night in Boston, that sometimes American troops might be sent to prevent humanitarian crises even if any direct threat to American security was remote. And he drew attention to Bosnia, where he was an earlier advocate of intervention than was President Clinton.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush's top foreign policy adviser, Condoleeza Rice, said on Tuesday night in Boston that the governor's concern about ''nation building'' centered on a fear that American troops were being used for ''civil administration, taking kids to kindergarten,'' and that they are unwisely ''sent to intervene in civil wars, as in Haiti.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore acknowledged that there was ''a legitimate concern about how far we go,'' but argued that part of what he called forward engagement in the world was the use of American troops to build courts, administrative agencies and schools. His father, later a senator, had such a role in Germany after World War II, he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When the discussion turned away from the Balkans and toward Indonesia -- where the United States has been deeply involved since the Asian economic crisis of 1997 and the forced resignation of President Suharto a year later -- Mr. Gore was clearly less comfortable describing how the United States might make use of ''forward engagement.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also had harsh words for Mr. Putin, saying that ''I'm very troubled by his apparent backtracking'' on the advances in press freedom, and on ''his conduct in Chechnya.'' But he said he would not favor withholding American aid as a lever to change Russia's actions, noting that most of the money goes toward dismantling Russia's nuclear arsenal. Nevertheless, he added, ''there is all kinds of leverage'' in Washington's other dealings with Moscow.

  After putting up with quite a few, well, less than five-star establishments, the Republican vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney beamed a videotaped message to the Bush campaign headquarters in Austin, Tex., about 10 days ago, threatening in his deadest dead pan to send the Bush campaign manager, Joe Allbaugh, ''on an all-expense paid trip to every lousy hotel we stayed in during the course of the campaign.''

  It just seemed that way at times because of his relentless recitation of facts and figures. In fact, however, a look at the debate transcript shows that Gov. George W. Bush talked more. He managed to get out 7,900 words in the 90 minutes, give or take a mouthful. Mr. Gore got out 7,400.

  In an extraordinary outpouring of bipartisan support, 49 of the nation's governors -- including George W. Bush of Texas and his brother Jeb Bush of Florida -- sent a joint letter to Congress last month calling on lawmakers to approve a five-year reauthorization of Americorps, President Clinton's signature national service program. The letter was a well-deserved tribute to the program's approximately 40,000 volunteers, who receive a $4,725 educational stipend in exchange for an intensive year performing valuable work like cleaning up dilapidated parks, tutoring at-risk children and helping communities to recover from natural disasters.

  With the presidential race considered a dead heat, both campaigns jockeyed hard for advantage the day after the 90-minute nationally televised debate. Mr. Bush's aides raised new questions about Mr. Gore's character, while the Gore campaign drew Mr. Bush into a sparring match over just how much his tax plan would favor the rich.

  First thing this morning, Mr. Bush's aides disputed the vice president's assertion during the debate that he had toured Texas fire scenes with James Lee Witt, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Gore was forced to backtrack in an appearance on ABC's ''Good Morning America.''
 </textdata>

  Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, said Mr. Gore had a shown a pattern of ''embellishment'' that could haunt him in the White House. ''In a meeting with a foreign leader, the president of the United States is representing our country,'' she said. ''The credibility of our country is on the line and the president of the United States in front of a world leader can't just make things up.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the vice president said that Mr. Gore had  been with Buddy Young, the regional head of FEMA in 1998, not Mr. Witt. She said that Mr. Bush and his aides were making ''personal attacks'' instead of ''talking about how to explain his tax cut.''

  Time and again Tuesday night, Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of a fiscal plan that ''spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest one percent'' than he does in new proposals for ''health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, with increasing detail as the day went on, acknowledged today that the wealthy did benefit under his plan, just like other Americans, but said it was not as much as Mr. Gore had asserted.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said that his tax cut would drop the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent because ''we don't believe the federal government should take more than a third of anybody's check in federal income taxes.'' He said that rate cut accounted for $149 billion or 11 percent of his tax-relief package.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That figure, Mr. Bush said, was  ''far less than the claims'' Mr. Gore made on television.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000

  As the college crowd chanted ''No fuzzy math,'' turning one of Mr. Bush's debate lines into a new political slogan, Mr. Bush reminded the audience of Mr. Gore's often mocked statement about the Internet.
 </textdata>

  ''He's invented a new calculator,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It's a calculator where you put real numbers in and it comes out with political numbers.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Hughes said the campaign calculated that the top one percent of income taxpayers would get about 20 percent of the portion of Mr. Bush's tax cut that results from a reduction in income tax rates, or $223 billion in tax reductions across 10 years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign shot back with conflicting figures of its own based on calculations by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group, that 42.6 percent of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, when fully phased in, would go to the wealthiest one percent of households. That would amount to  about $561 billion of the tax cut, Mr. Gore's aides said, and exceed the $474.6 billion in additional spending Mr. Bush calls for in the areas of national defense, health care, education, Medicare and other domestic programs in his fiscal plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One of the reasons for the different numbers lies in the repeal of the tax on large estates valued at $675,000 or more, which Mr. Bush has also proposed as part of his tax cut plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also sought to frame his tax proposals as emblematic of the different views he and his opponent have of government. ''He wants the federal government in our lives,'' Mr. Bush said in Boston. ''He wants the federal government making decisions on behalf of ordinary citizens. What I want to do is have a limited federal government.''

  To those few of us who are human-rights interventionists, Al Gore was not only more sure-footed in demeanor but more sensible about the need for the U.S. to apply pressure to remove Slobodan Milosevic after the Yugoslav election. Whichever of Bush's policy advisers suggested that we turn to Russia's Vladimir Putin as a mediator did the G.O.P. candidate a disservice. Gore, who should be on the defensive about his trust-Russia record, deftly took advantage of the opening.

  Contrariwise, Bush belted Gore all over the ring on accountability in  education. The Texas governor was both well versed and passionate; his sincerity was in contrast to the vice president's cornball use of a letter from a Florida parent complaining that a daughter had no desk to sit at  in class. (A local radio reporter then found out that the Sarasota classroom was crowded that day because $100,000 in new lab equipment had just been moved in. Live by folksy anecdotes, die by folksy anecdotes.)

  Gore again put on display his compulsion to exaggerate. Republicans call it ''the flaming whopper'': after Bush complimented the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its response to fires raging in Texas in 1998, Gore blurted, ''I accompanied [FEMA Director] James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.'' Not true; Gore went without Witt, said a few words about the fires at the Houston airport, and continued on to a trial lawyer's fund-raiser, one of those events he likes to call ''donor-related community outreach.''

  Abortion should have been Gore's strongest suit, but Bush put him on the defensive by raising its most extreme form. Gore responded, ''On the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion'' (he meant to say ''late-term or so-called partial birth abortion''), ''I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Note that insertion of severely. The loophole that pro-choicers want is ''health,'' which would allow a woman late in pregnancy to say that birth would cause her stress. By adding ''severely,'' Gore may upset some of his absolutist followers, but he shrewdly moves closer to the majority of voters who disapprove of the late-term procedure.

  An unremarked zinger was Bush's ''I don't know where the vice president stands'' on tearing down hydroelectric dams in the Northwest, as fish-protectors want and job-protectors oppose. Gore ignored that and continues to straddle, but the heat is now on for him to decide, which will cost him crucial votes in the swing states of Washington and Oregon.

  Bush missed a chance to counterpunch when Gore, with his lifelong pipeline to Occidental Petroleum, went into his populist riff blaming ''the big oil companies'' for oil prices. Bush failed to nail Gore for his election-time flip-flop on dipping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

  Gore programmed himself not to appear programmed, but the relentless robot showed through. Not thrice but 10 times on this Rialto did he repeat ''the wealthiest 1 percent,'' his rallying cry of class warfare. Bush's riposte was to point out that his across-the-board tax cuts would benefit the lower middle class more than Gore's more modest tax plan, but that appeal to the already-decideds failed to register.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What did come across was a certain amiable niceness, or even gentlemanliness, in Bush's demeanor even as he imputed phoniness to Gore's numbers, lack of credibility to his character and ''totally false!'' to his attacks. Bush proved he is not the caricature drawn of him.
 </textdata>

  Gore was undeniably a commanding presence, interrupting, demanding more time, reciting a series of hot-button points, to the brink of bullying both opponent and moderator (though Jim Lehrer kept equal-time discipline). That impulse to domineer probably helped the vice president with men, hurt him with women.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000

 <textdata>
  Offstage, Gore is a serious man of parts, but the part I didn't like in this debate was his mugging as his opponent was speaking. The eye-rolling, snorting, head-shaking, moaning, derisive displays of disbelief struck me as puerile and disrespectful.

  In all, two men with profound differences stood toe to toe, and Bush stunned detractors by holding his own. By not losing, he ''won.'' In Rounds Two and Three, he will have to win to win.

  Of all the contentious issues in their debate Tuesday night, none underscored the differences between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush more than taxes. Repeating himself relentlessly, Mr. Gore asserted that the Texas governor's proposed tax cuts would award more money to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers than the amounts Mr. Bush would set aside for education, health and defense combined. Mr. Bush accused the vice president of using ''fuzzy numbers,'' but never refuted the basic charge. In fact, Mr. Gore's formula was on target, illustrating a stark choice between the two candidates' approaches on the tax issue.

  Mr. Bush likes to defend his proposals as lowering tax rates for everyone, not just those who seize the narrowly crafted incentives offered by Mr. Gore. He has a point. In order to take advantage of the Gore tax cuts, taxpayers would have to tap into credits or deductions for child care, health insurance, college tuition, care of disabled relatives and other needs. A working-class family without these expenses might get little or no tax relief. It is legitimate to raise a question whether Mr. Gore's approach would further complicate an already complex tax code.

  But there are issues beyond simplicity. Among other steps, the Bush tax proposals would lower the marginal tax rates in all brackets, double the child tax credit and repeal the so-called ''death tax'' on estates -- a change that would benefit primarily the richest American families. Taken together, the Bush tax proposals would award 42.6 percent of the tax reductions to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal-leaning research group that bases its projections on figures from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.

  Contrary to Mr. Bush's claims, these are not ''fuzzy'' numbers. They illuminate the desire by most Americans for a fair-minded tax code that taxes those most able to pay at higher rates, without reducing the incentive for the rich to increase their wealth. That principle of progressivity has been around since the income tax was first enacted during the Civil War. It is a precept that lies at the core of a just society, as most of its members would understand it.

  Mr. Gore may continue to hammer at this point, and be accused of waging class warfare. But he has astutely sensed that public fervor for tax cuts, so prevalent in the 1980's, has given way to broader concerns with equity and fiscal responsibility. There can be no more important goal for a society than to reward its burdens and benefits in a recognizably fair way. Mr. Bush's tax proposals do not meet that test.

In fact, ''at risk'' generally means children who have learning impediments that are due to physical, emotional, socioeconomic or cultural factors.

  When, for instance, Mr. Gore repeated over and over that the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers would be the main beneficiaries of the tax cuts Mr. Bush has proposed, he sounded just like his Democratic forefathers.

  And this was Michael S. Dukakis addressing George Bush's tax plan in their first debate on Sept. 25, 1988: ''What he's proposing is a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent of people in this country.''

  In 1992 and 1996, Bill Clinton advocated a ''third way,'' something between the historical positions of Democrats and Republicans, and his opponents, George Bush and Bob Dole, were forced to defend political compromises they had struck as president and Senate majority leader, respectively.

  But it is much more than the matter of taxes and spending -- with Mr. Bush advocating deep, across-the-board tax cuts and Mr. Gore proposing heavy new spending for social programs -- where this year's campaign reflects long-held party positions.

  On the question of the proper role of the federal government, Mr. Bush accused Mr. Gore of wanting to ''increase the size of government dramatically,'' a plan that Mr. Bush said, ''empowers Washington.'' For his part, Mr. Bush went on, ''My passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves and their own lives.''

  Republicans, for the most part, voted against Social Security in the 1930's and against Medicare in the 1960's and have never fully accepted the doctrine of social insurance. Mr. Bush's advocacy of partial privatization of the two programs fits that mold.

  On energy, Mr. Bush's solution to high oil prices is more domestic production, Mr. Gore's is conservation. This is the same dispute Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan had in 1980.

  When Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of threatening to ''destroy precious parts of America's environment'' by drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, he was taking a cue from Mr. Dukakis, who in his second debate with Vice President George Bush called him ''the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew.''

  The arguments over qualifications for the Supreme Court have hardly changed since Earl Warren was chief justice in the 1950's and 1960's. On Tuesday night, Mr. Bush said, ''I believe in strict constructionists, and those are the kind of judges I will appoint.''

  This Congressional district, Ohio's 12th, has been visited and singled out as a ''must win'' by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader. Outside advertisements and other aid are being funneled in by pro-Democratic groups.

  Ms. Laflin's reporting was a contrast to the buildup the debate received in the local and national news media, which promoted the showdown between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore as a kind of political gunfight at the O.K. Corral. ''The debate could be a turning point, and I think both of them know it,'' Bob Schieffer told Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News. The local media picked up the theme, reinforcing the idea that the debate was more than a discussion of issues.

  On the national stage, what the people of New Mexico took away from the debate appeared to count for a lot, and certainly, a lot more than news people and their readers and viewers here are accustomed to. The Bush and Gore campaigns have devoted large amounts of time and money to the state; recent newspaper polls here show the race to be a dead heat. Adam Vance, a KOAT cameraman, counted seven visits to the state by Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush and their running mates since June.
 </textdata>

  ''We've never had anything like this, and I grew up here,'' said Ms. Laflin, who, unlike some of the reporters assigned full time to cover the nominees, has snared one-on-one interviews over the last month with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>

  The local contributions often consisted of polls: KOAT, the ABC affiliate and the market's dominant news station, ran an informal one on its Web site and the New Mexican published the results today of a Mason-Dixon poll it commissioned that gave Mr. Bush an edge of 44 percent to 41 percent, a difference within the survey's margin of error. And of course, the experiences of Joseph Austin, an Albuquerque construction worker who was tapped by the Gore campaign to be one its 13 ''real people'' advisers were faithfully related.

  Still, some voters here said they had been able to make judgments about the candidates based on highlights of the debate on local television.

 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  What caught his eye, he said, was an excerpt in which Mr. Gore declared himself to be his own man, a statement Mr. Martinez took to mean the vice president ''was positioning himself away from the Clinton scandals.'' The declaration struck him as so genuine, he said, that as a result, ''I'm up in the air.''

  ''We were already getting calls today asking us, 'What can you do to help us sort out the 'fuzzy arithmetic,' '' Mr. Robertson said, invoking a word Mr. Bush used repeatedly in the debate.

  Al Gore put on a bravura performance on Tuesday night by providing specific, easily understood descriptions of his proposals and pointed contrasts to Mr. Bush's plans.

  Mr. Bush did show up, and he spoke articulately. But he paled in comparison to Mr. Gore. He never responded to Mr. Gore's point that his tax cut would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population. He was also weak on foreign policy, military leadership, handling a financial crisis, and on abortion.

  Vice President Al Gore may love ''to show off'' his ''encyclopedic'' command of the facts. But given the extent of our continuing military investment in the Balkans, one would expect the candidates to know at least the names of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, and his current democratic challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, as well as something about the political makeup of a country we recently bombed.

  The bill coincides with another political question about the future of the drug: whether as president Mr. Bush, who opposes abortion, could force the F.D.A. to reverse its decision. The answer, experts say, is that while his doing so might be theoretically possible, it would be highly unlikely.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, the president can ask the F.D.A. to reconsider approval. In an interview last week, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, Ray Sullivan, said that if elected, the governor would order a ''careful review'' of the decision. But in the presidential debate on Tuesday night, Mr. Bush said only that he would ''make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.''

  Both Sides Say Debate Probably Changed Little  Republicans and Democrats alike conceded that the overall dynamics of the presidential race did not seem to have been changed by the debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov.

  At a rally in the courthouse square here, Mr. Gore mentioned the debate only in passing. ''Did you see the debate last night?'' he asked the  crowd.

  Offstage, Mr. Gore's campaign aides accused Mr. Bush of making several misstatements in the 90-minute exchange in Boston on Tuesday night and acknowledged that Mr. Gore had made a couple of slips himself. Mr. Gore conceded that he did not examine fires in Texas in 1998 with the director of the federal disaster agency, as he had said in the debate. It was the deputy director.

 <textdata>
  *That Mr. Gore had outspent him in the presidential campaign. ''Bush has spent $93 million, we spent $46 million,'' Mr. Lehane said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  *His response when Mr. Gore asked where he would find the trillion dollars to privatize Social Security: ''The trillion dollars comes from the surplus.'' Mr. Lehane pounced on this answer, saying, ''A trillion dollars on top of his budget numbers already? That would be economically disastrous for our country -- there's absolutely no way that that money exists.''

  In a second debate misstatement cited by the Bush campaign, Mr. Gore said Sarasota High School in Florida was overcrowded.

  The vice president seems to imply that Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposals, which will disproportionately benefit the rich, would cause this gap to grow. Although it's unknown what the effects of such a proposal would be, I know for sure that under this vice president's watch, the poor and a large part of the middle class have been left behind economically. If Al Gore wants to take credit for the great economy, he must accept the positives as well as the negatives. He can't have it both ways.

  While trying to sum up my reactions to Tuesday's debate, I couldn't help but come away with a feeling of deja vu (front page, Oct. 4). Just as in 1960, a sitting vice president spouted facts and figures while looking ill at ease. Mr. Bush, on the other hand,  was as pleasing to listen to as to watch, much as it was with John F. Kennedy.

  The issues discussed were covered adequately by both. Obviously, Mr. Gore thinks Washington knows best when it comes to what to do with our money, and Mr. Bush feels the people do. Mr. Gore likes to take credit for our prosperity, yet he rails against the companies and entrepreneurs that brought us to where we are today.

  I was astonished to hear George W.

Yet in Texas, Mr. Bush has presided over more than 100 executions since he  became governor. Isn't this a contradiction?

  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who had criticized the administration's plan as political opportunism, had no comment after the successful sale. But some analysts warned that uncertainties remained as to whether the sale would bring more heating oil to consumers soon, because refineries were already running at capacity.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Nonetheless, critics of the decision to release the government oil have argued that the 570-million-barrel reserve was created after the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's to protect against serious disruptions in oil supply, not to soften the blow of lagging inventories or high prices. Many detractors, including Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, saw in the administration's move a pre-election populist gesture to buoy the campaign of Vice President Al Gore.

  Most of America understands that the competence bar is set so low for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas that it's practically lying on the ground. It was pretty much acknowledged going into the debate that as long as he didn't misspell potato or mispronounce some three-syllable word or misstate the name of a world leader, he would be judged to have done O.K.

  If you paid attention to the content, and used it as a gauge to determine which candidate was better prepared, was more knowledgeable, had a greater command of the facts and grasp of the issues, then Vice President Gore won easily.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000

  He asserted, for example, that Governor Bush ''would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined.''

  The vice president clobbered Mr. Bush on the issue of prescription drugs for the elderly. And he scored well, I thought, when discussing potential appointments to the Supreme Court, saying, ''Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of [Antonin] Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.''

  But Vice President Gore never wins easily. He may have the experience and most of the issues on his side, but he can't keep his superciliousness in check. He just can't do it. So there he was on Tuesday night sighing loudly with disdain, or smiling contemptuously, or smugly, as Governor Bush did the best he could with this answer or that.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  There's an old saying: You don't shoot a man who's committing suicide. There were times during the debate when Governor Bush seemed not to understand the finer points of his own tax cut and Social Security proposals. And he seemed lost on matters of foreign policy. It would have been quite sufficient for Mr. Gore to give his own views on these matters and to correct any misstatements by his opponent.

  But Mr. Gore seems to feel the need to pour it on -- to offer not just his answer to a given question, but to show us everything he knows about the topic. He doesn't seem to realize that in the real world, people hate Eddie Haskell.

  The bad news for Bush supporters is that there are not many other reasons for undecided voters to shift to their man. Mr. Gore has got a good thing going with, among other things, his health care issues, his strong defense of a woman's right to choose, and the continued strong economy.

  Mr. Lazio, her Republican opponent, has not been not particularly vocal about education issues for most of his eight years in Congress, although he recently sponsored bills to expand alternative certification and teacher mentoring programs.

 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Lazio has called for $98 billion in new federal spending on education over the next decade -- compared with the roughly $125 billion in education spending that Mrs. Clinton has proposed. The amount is striking, considering that Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, has proposed spending a mere $25 billion over five years.

  Mr. Rendell said his party's nominee, for all his fine qualities, lacked the demeanor to close the deal with the American public in a single evening.

  Operatives in both camps said that today they began recalculating some of their decisions about priorities and resources in the wake of the debate. Advisers to Mr. Bush, for instance, said they were comfortable enough with the outcome of the debate that they had decided to funnel additional resources into more states, like California, that are leaning toward Mr. Gore.

 <textdata>
  Even as neither side claimed a triumph, Democrats and Republicans asserted that they had accomplished many objectives in the debate. Advisers to Mr. Bush said they believed that by standing side-by-side with Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush had put to rest nagging questions about whether he had a sufficient grasp of issues so he could hold his own against the vice president, a seasoned debater.

  ''People wanted reassurance,'' said Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top strategist. He added, ''The first and most important thing was for Bush to share with people a substantive agenda that was bold and optimistic.

He said he might have hoped -- but never expected -- Mr. Bush would have performed so badly that the race would essentially have ended on Tuesday night.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000

  Before the debate, Mr. Daley said, he had reminded Mr. Gore to stay upbeat. He said his worst-case scenario would have been if Mr. Bush had goaded the vice president into sounding mean and struggling to defend the administration's ethics.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-5-2000

 <textdata>
  ''I told him, 'Stay positive, don't take the bait of a negative attack,' '' Mr. Daley said. ''He clearly didn't and that helps him with the independents. They don't buy that.''

  Many Democrats, and even some Republicans, said Mr. Gore held a slight advantage because several polls showed him a few points ahead, though in most cases the lead was statistically insignificant.

  ''I really believe that with the economy -- which obviously isn't going to suffer enough to change this election -- it's a very tough race for Governor Bush to face,'' said former Senator Warren B.

  The timing is interesting. The coming series of debates, like the election itself, pits Mr. Bush, who has long assumed that he has a personality advantage, against Mr. Gore, who taps a seemingly greater command of policy details. Can anyone say Reagan-Carter in 1980, or Reagan-Mondale in 1984?
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Republican officials with ties to the Bush campaign can, noting that one of Mr. Bush's best hopes in the debates is to trump his opponent with charm, conviction and an aura of authentic and affable leadership, much as Mr. Reagan did.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, too, seems conscious of the parallels. In Orlando, Fla., a week ago, he derided what he said was the latest in a series of exaggerations and distortions by Mr. Gore with the phrase ''There he went again.'' It pointedly echoed a famous line Mr. Reagan used in a debate against Mr. Carter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In an interview with MSNBC around the same time, Mr. Bush responded to a question about why some people label him a lightweight by saying, ''I take great comfort in the fact that they said the same thing about President Ronald Reagan.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And later, on CNN, Mr. Bush said: ''I remember what they did to Ronald Reagan. They belittled him and said, 'Oh, he can't possibly be smart enough to be president of the United States. He is simply an actor.' The man turned out to be a great president.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000

 <textdata>
  Several of Mr. Bush's aides said there was no intricately plotted, overarching strategy at work.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They said Mr. Bush had quoted Mr. Reagan in the speech two weeks ago because he was addressing a Republican gathering in California, where Mr. Reagan had been governor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Bush quoted Mr. Reagan in the energy speech on Friday, they said, because Mr. Bush's argument against Mr. Gore was so much like the one Mr. Reagan had made against President Carter, who emphasized conserving energy over expanding the supply.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We did, to some extent, want to raise, for the people who remembered it, the specter of what was going on in the late 1970's,'' the adviser said, referring to the energy shortages and long gas lines that helped undo Mr. Carter. Mr. Bush has used rising fuel costs to imply that the Clinton administration is bringing the country to the brink of similar woes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But several of Mr. Bush's advisers and other Republican strategists noted that there were additional reasons for him to refer to Mr. Reagan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush is trying to persuade an electorate that does not necessarily prefer his positions and policies that he would be a better, more optimistic, more inspiring leader. Mr. Reagan talked about ''morning in America''; Mr. Bush occasionally quotes a Texas artist who talked about living on ''the sunrise side'' of the mountain.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush is selling a sweeping tax cut as economically healthy, and after President Reagan signed such legislation, the economy did improve. Mr. Bush has repeatedly credited that development as the wellspring of today's prosperity, neglecting to mention that federal debt ballooned.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Of course, it is customary for a candidate who wants to be his party's leader in the future to talk about the party's leaders from the past, and Mr. Bush's choices from the last few decades are limited.

  Vice President Al Gore heads into Tuesday's debate with a reputation as one of the most artful and combative political debaters in modern history. He is certainly one of the most practiced, having participated in 43 televised debates since he first ran for the Senate in 1984.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What is evident from a recent review of many of those encounters is that Mr. Gore is uncommonly disciplined. He will question an opponent relentlessly to make a point. A ruthless competitor, he can be unflinchingly aggressive. The vice president clearly took to heart a note his mother slipped to him before a 1988 debate: ''Smile, relax, attack.''

  Mr. Gore's experience leaves his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, trying to bat down the impression that Mr. Gore is the more accomplished debater. But most of Mr. Gore's practice has come at the expense of fellow Democrats. In the 1988 presidential primaries, he debated members of his own party 26 times. In the 2000 primaries, he debated former Senator Bill Bradley nine times. His debates against Republicans -- Dan Quayle in 1992 and Jack F. Kemp in 1996 -- were for the vice presidency, and his 1993 debate with Ross Perot was limited to a single issue, Nafta.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Tuesday's debate in Boston will be Mr. Gore's first at the presidential level. Mr. Gore likes to say that his opponent has never lost a debate -- Mr. Bush was in two before this campaign -- because he won the ensuing elections. Almost all of Mr. Gore's opponents have been weaker performers, unprepared to address issues or to fight back. In 1988, the field was so crowded (six or seven other Democrats) that it was hard for any participant to make a mark.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Quayle was determined not to repeat his humiliating experience of 1988, when Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen told him, ''You're no Jack Kennedy.'' So Mr. Quayle ignored Mr. Gore and instead attacked Bill Clinton. Mr. Gore stuck resolutely to his message and did not defend Mr. Clinton, and wound up looking flat-footed -- and enraging Mr. Clinton. In an interview today, Mr. Gore said he had little recollection of that encounter and shrugged off the cumulative effect of Mr. Quayle's attacks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In addition, Mr. Birdsell said: ''Gore is one of the most effective attackers in debates in the business. He plays the bully in the playground, like when he beat up on Bruce Babbitt in the primary debates in '88. He started the biggest attack on Babbitt, then everyone began to treat Babbitt as a comic character, and it was all set up by Al Gore. It works for him. It has the potential to backfire, but so far he's been able to walk that line very effectively.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Spontaneity takes a holiday in Gore debates. He goes into these forums thoroughly versed in his opponent's record and ready to use it -- Mr. Bradley might say ready to distort it. When Mr. Bradley said in this year's Democratic primary that President Clinton should sign an executive order banning racial profiling, Mr. Gore countered sharply: ''Racial profiling practically began in New Jersey, Senator Bradley.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But that exception proves the rule. Increasingly, Mr. Gore likes to show he is in complete control. As he and Mr. Bradley were at their lecterns waiting for a debate to begin last October, Mr. Gore asked the audience, ''Anybody have a question?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Despite his command of the dialogue, Mr. Gore's body language tends toward the tense -- except when he is deliberately trying to look relaxed by putting his left hand in his pocket and wandering around the stage. More often than not, he opens with a planned surprise, offering his opponent some sort of deal -- a handshake to Mr. Bradley to eliminate television commercials, a joking suggestion to Mr. Kemp that if the former quarterback would refrain from using football metaphors, Mr. Gore would not mention ''any of my warm and humorous stories about chlorofluorocarbon abatement.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  These moves -- his critics call them gimmicks -- have added to Mr. Gore's reputation as a master at flummoxing the other side, to great amusement in his 1993 debate with Ross Perot. To brand Mr. Perot as a protectionist, Mr. Gore pulled out a picture of Reed Smoot and Willis C. Hawley, the dreary-looking authors of a famously misguided tariff, the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act. He said he had it specially framed for Mr. Perot. Clearly irked, Mr. Perot grabbed the present and slammed it face down on his desk.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard and Mr. Quayle's chief of staff, said that the best approach with Mr. Gore was to try to knock him off his script.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Gore is like one of these well-oiled machines,'' Mr. Kristol said. ''If you let him get going and pick up momentum, he's relentless and very hard to stop. If you can get him off his game early and disrupt his plans, he doesn't adjust terribly well.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his least appealing moments, Mr. Gore can seem sanctimonious and condescending. He likes to show how much he knows. Some call it the Eddie Haskell effect; he appears to be the model student, pandering to the teacher, but when the teacher leaves the room, he turns around and annihilates his fellow students.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  With Mr. Gore, the wheels are always spinning, sometimes visibly. ''Let me take 10 seconds to finish my last answer,'' he frequently says. At a debate at Dartmouth College last fall, a woman asked Mr. Gore how to end school violence. ''Hmmmmmm,'' he said, as if hearing the question for the first time. ''Tell me about your family.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In an overt effort to connect with the audience, Mr. Gore made a small joke about her family (''One daughter 17 months old and a husband -- which one do you have more trouble with?'') but then jumped the rails: ''First, a brief comment on the latest exchange.'' The audience laughed. Mr. Gore's visage grew stern at the laughter and he held up his hand in a command to stop.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore almost never makes gaffes or utters one-liners that work against him or, for that matter, are particularly memorable. His speech patterns, characterized by unfailingly formal syntax and multiple subordinate clauses, are generally too complex for that.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This has spawned concern in the Gore camp that the vice president needs to figure out better how to speak to ''real people.'' Mr. Gore is rather showily not cramming for these face-offs. Instead, his campaign has set up ''debate camp'' here with 13 ordinary citizens he met along the campaign trail. They will serve, he said, as his ''sounding board'' and ''reality check.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The novel move is an implicit acknowledgment that Mr. Gore still has difficulty conveying his humanity to voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore tends to get lost in mind-numbing, eye-glazing detail. Aides said that having ''real people'' at practice sessions will help him focus on condensing his thoughts into easily digestible nuggets.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And in what has become a Gore tradition, he expects to have them at the debate in Boston. Analysts trace his success in the Iowa caucuses this year to his display of Chris Peterson, an Iowa farmer and flood victim, at a forum in Des Moines where he questioned Mr. Bradley's commitment to farmers and Mr. Bradley appeared not to know his own record.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As Mr. Gore said the other day, he is hoping that his familiarity with issues -- and the fact that his positions are generally more popular with voters than Mr. Bush's are -- will win people over in a way that his personality might not.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked if he was concerned he might win the debate on points and lose on style, Mr. Gore said: ''I think that it's the same question people ask about how people vote. Do they vote on the issues or on the person? Both. How do you separate them out? I mean, the way they think about somebody and they way they feel about somebody colors the way they interpret stands on the issues. But vice versa also -- the way the positions on the issues can have an impact on how they feel about somebody. So, I don't know. That's above my level of expertise. I just feel my way along.''

  Those are the undecided voters in swing states with lots of votes in the Electoral College. Elementary math explains why both Al Gore and George W. Bush are paying much less attention to most of the South, New England and the Mountain West, as well as California, New York and Texas. These places are reliably Republican or Democratic, and there is not much point in contesting them.

  In some ways, Mr. Gore has proved more adept than Mr. Bush at aiming micro-messages at swing voters in swing states. The vice president's call for opening the strategic petroleum reserve and his attacks on Big Oil appeal to Midwestern voters worried about high heating bills this winter. His support for expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs is intended to appeal to elderly voters in Florida, the one big Southern state in play.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Earlier, Mr. Gore went after another important electoral bloc in Florida, Cuban-Americans, by disagreeing with the Clinton administration in the Elian Gonzalez case. Though usually outspoken on the environment, Mr. Gore has been careful not to stress this theme too heavily when he is in the Rust Belt, where it is not popular with manufacturing workers. He has just as carefully avoided making an issue of gun control, which is unpopular with many Reagan Democrats in the Midwest.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While Mr. Bush is spending most of his time in swing states, too, he has not, like Mr. Gore, cobbled together an ad hoc platform that makes specific promises to specific swing voters. The one exception may be Latinos, whom Mr. Bush frequently addresses in Spanish. A number of big swing states have large Latino populations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For the same reason, a Democratic presidential candidate, instead of writing off Texas and even vilifying it, as Vice President Gore has done, would court the states' substantial minority of Democrats and independents. A candidate who stressed a few themes of national importance might rack up more electoral votes nationwide than a rival who focused on a few important states.

  Vice President Al Gore, who is known as one of the most ferocious debaters in American politics, said today that he would try a new tack -- and tone -- in his first televised encounter with Gov. George W. Bush: keep the focus on his own proposals and try to resist savaging his opponent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000

 <textdata>
  Strolling in his bare feet along the beach in this resort community on the Gulf Coast near Sarasota, where he is preparing for the first general election debate, on Tuesday, Mr. Gore said he expected to spew facts and figures -- as he did at the Democratic convention -- and not barbs at Mr. Bush.

  ''I'm looking at this one differently,'' Mr. Gore said in an interview that was repeatedly interrupted by well-wishers ambling up to him as the surf rolled in gently. ''I'll be communicating less on him and more on the people watching. That will be my single-minded focus.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By inviting two reporters to walk with him on the beach, Mr. Gore was clearly trying to convey that he was in high spirits, and at ease with his debate preparations. In saying that his strategy would be positive and future-oriented, the vice president also might have been trying to throw off Mr. Bush as he prepared at his ranch in Crawford, Tex.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Whatever the intention, Mr. Gore seemed to enjoy his late morning constitutional. He chuckled at the contrast between his gray shorts and polo shirt and the suit and wingtips Richard M. Nixon wore when he, famously, walked the beach.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore looked so much like he was on holiday that one woman asked, ''Are you just on vacation?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''No, I've been preparing for the debates,'' Mr. Gore responded, laughing heartily and stretching out his arms. ''Can't you tell?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another beachgoer, Mort Goodman, handed the vice president a sealed envelope with the words, ''Memo For Debate Enclosed.'' That prompted Mr. Gore to say, ''This is better than finding seashells! Thank you.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There was such an outpouring from bystanders that Mr. Gore observed, ''I'm beginning to think we planted these people.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In seeking to break from his past as a basher in debates, Mr. Gore said that when he contrasted himself with Mr. Bush, he would focus more on their substantive differences, particularly the Texas governor's tax-cut plan. He said he would be less inclined to reach back and disparage  Mr. Bush's record in Texas, although the Democrats were doing that in television commercials.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I will talk less about his Texas record and more about proposals that are relevant to the future -- his and mine,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I'll spend most of my time talking about mine.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another incentive for Mr. Gore to stick to issues, his aides said, was that polls showed that his positions were relatively popular while Mr. Bush's strength was his personality.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said he was buoyed by the response to his policy-laden speech at the Democratic National Convention, and he seemed comfortable with the idea that his selling point was his command of issues. ''As I said at the convention,'' he said, ''the presidency is not a popularity contest.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked if it was hard to compete on personality with the affable Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore was not about to concede anything, saying, ''It's in the ear, and eye, of the beholder.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Contending that Americans have had enough of ''sound bites and generalities,'' Mr. Gore said he did not expect to arrive in Boston on Tuesday armed with a batch of one-liners or ploys -- as in the primaries when he challenged Bill Bradley to eliminate television commercials. ''I'm not planning any gimmicks,'' Mr. Gore said. ''If something comes up that looks like a gimmick, you'll know it's spontaneous.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As part of his campaign to show that he was of good cheer and more interested in the people than in his opponent, Mr. Gore was the host of a brunch of shrimp salad with 13 ''real people'' his campaign flew down here to watch him in a mock debate today and offer their tips. One of them, Matt Moseley, an Atlanta firefighter, advised Mr. Gore: ''Just have a conversation like we are. I don't envy you a bit trying to find that balancing between, I guess, the more technical side of the debate and the human side of the debate.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's aides said they recognized that in citing policy the vice president could come off as pedantic, not to say dull. When Mr. Gore ran through a practice debate Saturday night and again today, one aide said, a goal was to help him ''explain these complex policy ideas'' in a reasonable amount of time and ''do it in human terms.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While he tried to convey a sense of openness in the interview, Mr. Gore was guarded in discussing how he was preparing for the debate and how he viewed his sparring partner.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president seemed to jump to Mr. Bush's defense when asked about how the governor sometimes mispronounced words, saying, ''I think more is made of it than should be made of it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Despite the display on the beach and the consultation with ordinary people, Mr. Gore retreated to serious practice sessions with a vanload of advisers. It was not lost on Mr. Gore that a stuffed shark graced their practice room at the Mote Marine Laboratory in nearby Sarasota. Yet even as he tried to play down his fiercely competitive nature, there was no doubt that he and his advisers were preparing for what could be a bitter encounter. Suggesting that the be-nice-to-Bush strategy could be canned in an instant, one aide who was advising Mr. Gore here said, ''If he whacks us, we're not going to sit and take it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore certainly must have appreciated the spirited words of Allison Frankel, 24, of Chapel Hill, N.C., when she walked up to him on the beach: ''We expect you to kick some butt.'' Mindful, perhaps, that he not sound too primed for battle, Mr. Gore replied, simply, ''I appreciate your best wishes.''

  As a Yale freshman George W. Bush was the only pledge in his fraternity who could stand up and recite the names of the other 49 pledges. In his first year at Harvard Al Gore was knocking on doors and shaking hands while running for freshman council. In ''The Choice 2000,'' a joint biography of the presidential candidates, these differences still define the men and their campaigns: Mr. Bush's cult of personality and Mr. Gore's marathon of perseverance.

 <textdata>
  Among the people interviewed is the son of the tenants on the Gore farm in Tennessee whose family young Al stayed with during school vacations; Gore Sr. insisted on these stints, which gave the boy a seasoning in hard work and useful political roots. Paradoxically, it was Mr. Bush's ancestors who were rich, blue-blooded Easterners, despite the down-home ease his Texas childhood conferred.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As it goes back and forth contrasting the men's lives, ''The Choice'' gets progressively weaker, making the necessary, obvious stops. There is Mr. Bush's decision to stop drinking when he turned 40, and the natural political flair that led to his quick rise when he decided to run for governor. There is Mr. Gore's disappointment after his brief run for president in 1988 and the personal tragedies of his sister's death and his young son's serious car accident.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But ''The Choice'' fails to do the very thing it should: connect all its biographical data to the ideas and styles that drive the campaigns. Only at the end does it ask, as a kind of farewell, whether Governor Bush is intellectually weighty enough to be president and Vice President Gore exciting enough to win.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000

 <textdata>
  ''The Choice 2000'' does illuminate the shaky state of political biography on television. Recently ABC took a similar approach and did a more thoughtful, more revealing job of connecting biography and politics in a two-part prime-time special called ''Family Business.'' (It included the anecdotes about Mr. Bush's memory for pledges and Mr. Gore's freshman campaign; apparently there are only so many telling details in anyone's life.) But the fine ''Family Business'' was practically buried. It was not sent out for review; the second part was shown opposite the Olympics opening ceremony.

Friedman (column, Sept. 26) criticizes Al Gore for lacking a real program on energy, yet ignores Mr. Gore's ambitious plan proposed in June that would give American families energy choices, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and clean up our air and water. In contrast, George W. Bush's plan is basically the same old drill, drill, drill -- even in our few remaining pristine natural areas.

  Mr. Gore would offer families tax incentives to purchase fuel-efficient cars, homes and home products. He would invest in light-rail systems, cleaner buses and high-speed trains that would cut traffic, reduce smog and end our dependence on foreign oil. He supports market-based approaches to clean up and increase the efficiency of our nation's aging power plants. And he has long backed renewable energy from biomass fuels, wind and solar power.

  Mr. Gore likes interjections with an edge. Here he was in a Dec. 1, 1987, debate in Washington with ve other Democrats, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Gore was running as the Southern candidate.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Gore also thoroughly researches his opponent's positions and can be quick to unspool those positions. In his Oct. 9, 1996, vice-presidential debate with Jack F. Kemp in St. Petersburg, Fla., he did this after Mr. Kemp said that ownership of one's own home was afrmative action of the sort that Abraham Lincoln would have favored.

  Bush Returns to Tax Cut Plan  After months of burnishing his image as a new Republican with proposals for modest social programs, Gov. George W. Bush has gone into the final sprint of the presidential race by returning his ambitious across-the-board tax cut plan to the center of his campaign.

  Gore's Debate Reputation  Vice President Al Gore heads into tomorrow's presidential debate with a reputation as one of the most artful, combative and practiced political debaters in modern history. But most of his practice has come at the expense of fellow Democrats.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said he would try a new tack -- and tone -- in his first televised debate with Mr. Bush: keep the focus on his own proposals and try to resist savaging his opponent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000

  But spokesmen for Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said the candidates had nothing to do with Mr. Nader's failed efforts to join the debates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The reality is that there are over 200 people running for president,'' said Jano Cabrera, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At one point, Mr. Nader called Mr. Bush ''a corporation running for president disguised as a person.'' But his harshest attacks were reserved for the Democratic Party in general and Mr. Gore in particular.

 <textdata>
  Then he will say he trusts the people to manage their own money, while Mr. Gore trusts ''the thinkers and planners and plotters'' in Washington -- language that harks all the way back to conservative criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal brain trust.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's emphasis on tax relief as one of his core issues puts him at the forefront of conservative thought and comes as Republicans in high-profile races, like the Senate candidates Rick A. Lazio in New York and George F. Allen in Virginia, have offered more modest plans instead of embracing Mr. Bush's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has stepped up his assaults on Mr. Bush's proposal, arguing that it would reward the wealthy and hurt the economy. But the governor's aides say he will succeed in using tax cutting as a mainstay of his candidacy, where others have failed, in part because the size of the surplus has weakened arguments against tax relief.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In addition, they say, Mr. Bush is pitching his plan in ways Republicans have not tried in the past.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The tax cut is laced into a comprehensive package of issues that also includes Social Security, Medicare and education. Each issue is used to argue that Mr. Bush allows people to make their own choices in life, while Mr. Gore would increase the power and scope of the government.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The tax cut becomes a surrogate for a broader discussion about values and the role of government,'' a Bush adviser said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And instead of portraying tax cutting in economic terms, Mr. Bush uses values-laden language. He speaks of ''fairness'' and right and wrong, words designed to blunt the traditional charge by Democrats that across-the-board tax cutting gives huge windfalls to upper-income Americans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So, for example, Mr. Bush will call his $1.3 trillion 10-year tax cut equitable because it reduces tax rates for all income brackets. And he brands Mr. Gore's smaller cut of just under $500 billion across 10 years social engineering because people get tax credits for certain social needs, like a college education, child care or long-term care for the elderly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I don't believe my job as the president is to say O.K., you're the right kind of person, you're the wrong kind of person,'' Mr. Bush frequently says. ''My job as president is to say O.K., if we're going to have tax relief, let's be fair, and everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush rarely dwells on the overall cost of his tax cut. ''Bush communicates taxes without using numbers,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ''You could criticize the Republican Party for not figuring this out before.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The lack of emphasis on a figure also serves to reduce any disharmony with Congressional Republicans, according to party strategists. They note that even if Mr. Bush and Congressional candidates are not talking about the same size tax cut, they are hitting the same themes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We don't see it as a problem at all, because all of them say in one form or another they are embracing independent components of our plan,'' one aide to Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In some ways, Mr. Bush had little choice but to campaign hard on his tax cut as a way of fighting Mr. Gore's claims that his opponent is for ''the powerful'' and he is for ''the people.'' Mr. Bush's aides acknowledge that the governor's proposals for overhauling Medicare, for creating a prescription drug benefit and for reshaping Social Security are complicated and can be difficult to explain in concrete ways.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Since Mr. Bush's Medicare plan, for example, envisions competition between private insurers and the government Medicare program, his aides cannot say with any certainty what a monthly premium would be.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But they can say how much money people would receive under Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The idea of showcasing families to talk about tax cuts came from Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director. The governor's aides say the couples, known inside the campaign as ''tax families,'' have two purposes. They help the governor excite the Republican base with tax cutting, and they come from the same income bracket as many of those voters who are viewed as undecided in this year's presidential race.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is precisely such perceptions that the Bush campaign is trying to dispel. So it is no accident that the governor often showcases couples whose income hovers around the $50,000 range. In addition, his chosen couples are ones who are ineligible for Mr. Gore's many tax credit proposals: they itemize their taxes and have no children in day care, no college tuition costs and few savings.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Last week the Zells of Redwood City, Calif., were one of the couples on display. Mr. Bush said that by his count they would get a $2,175 tax cut under his plan and $100 under Mr. Gore's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has focused on particular points to try to deride Mr. Gore's plan. He notes that under Mr. Gore's proposal to end the so-called marriage penalty -- the quirk in the tax law that makes some couples pay more taxes when they marry and file jointly than when they were single -- relief is available only to couples who do not itemize. A newly married couple who buy a house and deduct the mortgage interest get no marriage penalty relief, he points out, while those who rent do.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign argues the case differently. Mr. Gore's tax-cut proposal would alleviate the marriage penalty by raising the standard deduction for married couples, which is taken only by relatively low-income people. In short, Mr. Gore's aides say, he is directing this particular tax benefit to the neediest.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Democrats say they will trump Mr. Bush in the tax-cutting debate. They point to Senator John McCain, who beat Mr. Bush in the New Hampshire primary with a smaller tax-cut plan and the argument that Mr. Bush risked reopening deficits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore makes that same point nearly every day, and charges as well that Mr. Bush cannot afford to invest enough in programs like education or Medicare because of the scope of his tax cut. He and his aides also point to the tax breaks the wealthy would receive under Mr. Bush's plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So last week, on a day when Mr. Bush was speaking of education, Ronald A. Klain, a Gore adviser, countered in a news release: ''George Bush says his priority is education, but his real priority is tax cuts for the wealthy. How can he really invest in education, when he spends so much of the surplus on tax breaks for the few?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And on Friday, Mr. Gore called Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut ''a plan which spends $667 billion on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans and would wreck our good economy in the process.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's staff has also analyzed how two hypothetical families who sound a lot like the Bushes and the Cheneys would fare under Mr. Bush's tax cut.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A married couple from Wyoming earning $4.4 million a year, the Gore camp said, would get a $278,000 tax cut under Mr. Bush's proposal. A Texas family with one wage earner in state government but considerable additional income of $1.3 million annually would get a $60,000 reduction, the Gore staff said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in the Republican Party, even onetime critics of Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal approve of the way he is now campaigning on the issue. Rick Davis, who was Mr. McCain's campaign manager, said Mr. Bush must campaign hard on his tax cut because the election is likely in the end to turn on the economy. ''I think he's doing the right thing,'' Mr. Davis said. ''If you're going to run with this big tax cut, you'd better sell it.''

 </textdata>

  ''I disagree with him on this,'' Mr. Lazio said of Mr. Bush in explaining his support for the ruling by the Food and Drug Administration allowing the marketing of RU-486, or mifepristone.

  Bush and Hague would have no such conflicts in their world views. Hague envisions an expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement to the European Union, presumably with Britain as the fulcrum. That suits the U.S. more than the goal of a ''United States of Europe,'' dominated by Germany and France, that Clinton-Gore rhetoric tended to encourage.
 </textdata>

  Clinton-Gore had prickly relations with Netanyahu. Recently, Clinton's ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, publicly called for the division of Jerusalem; his extreme statement stands as Clinton policy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Perhaps Gore would repudiate that position, long rejected by Netanyahu, if asked about it in tomorrow night's debate; Bush surely would. Pro-Israeli hard-liners have greater trust in Gore than Clinton, but when Gore adopts a favorite administration formulation -- that the U.S. should stand with Israel when Israel takes risks for peace -- the question arises, What about when those risks are too great?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Would Bush twist Netanyahu's arm to make previously unthinkable concessions, as Clinton and Indyk did with Barak? The jury is out on that because the memory of his father's gurus, James Baker and Brent Scowcroft, still rankles. But when George W.'s national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, visited Israel last month, she seemed impressed with the strategic value of the Golan Heights. And if George Shultz continues to be the elder-statesman adviser to Bush the younger, White House arm-twisting on security would stop.

  The sharp rise in oil prices over the last few months has given energy issues new and unexpected prominence in the presidential campaign.

Vice President Al  Gore says the Republicans have allowed ''big oil'' to put profits ahead of the American consumer. All this has diverted attention from two inconvenient truths about America's energy problem.

 <textdata>
  The differences between the two candidates on energy issues are pronounced. Mr. Bush sought to narrow these differences in a major address on Friday, calling for $1.4 billion in tax credits over 10 years to encourage electricity generation from alternative fuels. He also said he would spend $2 billion over 10 years for ''clean coal'' technologies, aimed at exploiting the country's huge supplies of cheap but polluting supplies of coal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But his strategy still relies mainly on increasing supply, including uncontroversial ideas like streamlining regulatory restrictions on pipeline construction and hugely controversial ideas like opening the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. According to the latest government estimates, the mean estimate of economically recoverable oil in the plain is 3.2 billion barrels. Environmentalists and Mr. Gore do not think it is worth defacing a pristine wilderness for what amounts to about six months' worth of oil.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For his part, Mr. Gore has offered a dizzying array of proposals aimed at increased energy efficiency. These include generous tax credits for more fuel-efficient buildings and factories, and for consumers who buy fuel-efficient vehicles and appliances. In addition, Mr. Gore proposes major federal investments in light rail systems and various public-private partnerships, including a Gore favorite, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, which is aimed at developing cars and trucks that run on batteries or fuel cells.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In dollar terms, Mr. Gore's energy proposals would cost about $50 billion over 10 years, dwarfing Mr. Bush's $7.1 billion. But dollars do not accurately define this debate. Mr. Gore believes that consumption is the main problem. Mr. Bush thinks that production is the main answer. This is as clear a difference as one can find in this campaign.

  They can be wrong. (Some must be; otherwise, how to explain different polls showing both George W. Bush and Al Gore slightly ahead of each other, and Hillary Rodham Clinton beating Rick A.

He also spoke more broadly of the high-technology, investor-driven ''new economy,'' portraying himself as an advocate of an entrepreneurial future and Mr. Gore as a relic the ''planners and bureaucrats'' of the past.

  ''We are attracting young, ambitious workers from all across America,'' Mr. Bush said.

  But at the heart of Mr. Bush's  address was his proposal for Social Security. On Wednesday the Democrats, moving fast to take advantage of one of the exchanges in the third and last presidential debate, began broadcasting a commercial about Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Asking ''which promise is he going to break?'' the advertisement echoes the language Mr. Gore used when he raised Social Security in the last moments of the debate.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security trust fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own,'' Mr. Gore said in the debate, referring to Mr. Bush. ''But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them. So this is the Show Me State, reminds me of the line from the movie, 'Show me the money.' Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, governor?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Democratic criticisms were based on the fact that Mr. Bush has put out the framework of a Social Security plan but not details, saying he wants flexibility to negotiate with Congress.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Analysts say that the transition from the current system to the kind proposed by Mr. Bush will require some hard choices. Under the Social Security system the payroll taxes of current workers are now used to pay current retirees. So if part of those taxes are shifted into private accounts, a way has to be found to keep paying current retirees.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush did not provide more details yesterday, but instead ridiculed Mr. Gore's math, saying, ''My opponent, a man prone to exaggeration at times, seems to be deliberately missing a trillion dollars. Maybe if you've been in Washington too long you lose your ability to count real money.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To give his advocacy of private accounts the sheen of bipartisanship, Mr. Bush invoked two Democratic senators who favor such an approach -- Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Both men are leaving Congress at the end of this session.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''With this Social Security reform, over time the working class will join the investor class,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Millions of Americans -- of every race and age and background -- will have not only wages, but accumulated wealth.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush found other ways to go after Mr. Gore, winning the applause of his audience. He noted that a Texan, Jack S. Kilby, had just won the Nobel Prize for inventing the integrated circuit in the 1950's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It was an amazing achievement, unrivaled in the annals of technology -- until 1986 when one senator from Tennessee, alone in his office, invented the Internet,'' Mr. Bush said, mocking Mr. Gore's statement in 1999 that he had been instrumental in the creation of the Internet.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Yesterday, the Democratic Party released its latest attack ad prepared by the Gore media team and designed to scare seniors. The chairman said that I had grabbed the third rail of American politics, and ''he just didn't realize that we hadn't switched on the electricity yet and that's what we're going to do with this television ad as well.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is irresponsible for the chairman of the Democratic Party and for Vice President Gore to stoke the fears of seniors while ignoring the hopes of  younger workers. A true leader does not try to pit grandparents against grandchildren; a true leader will fix this problem so that both the Greatest Generation and the Rising Generation can depend on the promise of Social Security.

  The campaign for president made a rare stop in New York last night, as Gov. George W.

Lazio.

  The campaign for president made a rare stop in New York last night, as Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore gave dueling pointed speeches before a white-tie audience that included two people who had, until yesterday, kept a distance from those two presidential candidates: Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick A. Lazio.

  For Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, it was a rare opportunity, aside from their three debates, to speak from the same stage, albeit under the historical guidelines of these dinners: Speeches should be funny, and not stumpy. But they are allowed to have a political point, and both candidates seemed to approach the evening as another night of competition in their contest.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore offered a few self-deprecating jokes about some things that have caused problems for his candidacy this year. ''This dinner represents a hallowed and important tradition, which I actually did invent,'' he said to shouts of laughter from a crowd that included virtually every major elected official in New York.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And he also offered a few remarks with a sharp political edge, directed at his opponent, who also sat on the stage. ''Al Smith ran on an agenda that was revolutionary for his time,'' Mr. Gore said, referring to the presidential candidate for whom the dinner is named. ''A 45-cent minimum wage. Limiting the work week to six days. Building a bridge to the 1930's. And I must say it's quite a tribute to Governor Smith that Governor Bush has adopted the same agenda.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush responded with the same mix of jokes and barbs. ''This is an impressive crowd,'' he said. ''The haves and the have-mores. Some people call you the elite. I call you my base.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But he ended his speech with a long and serious tribute to the late Cardinal John J. O'Connor who, Mr. Bush told the hushed crowd, ''defied all the labels and showed us that sometimes truth is larger than the left and the right.'' And Mr. Bush, who opposes abortion in most cases, made particular mention of Cardinal O'Connor's advocacy of the ''rights of the unborn,'' drawing heavy applause from many of the people in the room. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gore did not applaud.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For Mrs. Clinton, the presence of Mr. Gore in New York was an opportunity, and she leapt at the chance to campaign, for the first time since last March, with a politician who polls show is significantly more popular among New Yorkers than she is. With much fanfare, she appeared with Mr. Gore and his running mate, Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut senator, at a labor rally earlier yesterday in Midtown, and thrust herself between them on the stage as she sought to cast the contest in sharply partisan terms.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore then picked up the line, noting that there is no ''Gore-Lieberman-Lazio team,'' as he moved to blunt Mr. Lazio's effort in recent days to enlist Democratic Gore supporters to his campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I want to say it plainly and clearly there is only one candidate for the United States Senate who is part of the Gore-Lieberman team, and that is Hillary Clinton,'' Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By contrast, Mr. Lazio and Mr. Bush barely crossed paths today. They held no joint events. When Mr. Lazio appeared at a news conference with Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, a Democratic Party activist showed up with a life-size cutout of Mr. Bush in an attempt to create the photo opportunity that Mr. Lazio seemed intent on avoiding.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And at the dinner last night, an event where seating charts are perhaps overly scrutinized for political significance, Mr. Lazio sat on the opposite side of the stage from Mr. Bush; even Mrs. Clinton sat closer to the Republican candidate for president than Mr. Lazio did. In contrast to Mrs. Clinton, who eagerly greeted Mr. Gore, Mr. Lazio did not appear to go to any special effort to be photographed greeting Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Lazio and Mr. Bush have not appeared together in New York since July 16. The Republican candidate for Senate has, in his campaign, gone to great lengths to distance himself from Mr. Bush, who Mr. Lazio's aides view as a drag on his own candidacy in New York.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gore last campaigned together on March 20, in Albany, though they have appeared together at other political events, most recently a fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall last month. Part of that is because there has been no real reason for Mr. Gore to come to New York, given his large lead in polls in the state. There is also inevitable tension between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gore as they have each sought, in their own way, to carve a political identity separate from President Clinton.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  These dinners have more than once provided a forum for presidential sparring, though the last time both presidential candidates attended one of these dinners was in 1988, when Mr. Bush's father, then vice president, and Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic candidate for president, shared a stage with Cardinal O'Connor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although New York is not in play, it was hard to tell by the effort that both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush brought to their two speeches, a combination of jokes, skilled shots at their opponents, and even efforts to display their knowledge of New York politics.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''By the way: was it my imagination, or did Mayor Giuliani nod when I said, your excellency?'' Mr. Gore said, referring to his own salutation a moment earlier to the archbishop. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani dropped his head and smiled.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At another point, referring to his own debate performance, Mr. Gore said: ''Please accept my apologies for interrupting your meal. Since this is a special occasion, I wanted to mark it by getting all my interruptions out of the way before Governor Bush speaks.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush did not appear that amused at many of Mr. Gore's jokes and, if the reaction of the audience was any guide, the Texas governor probably came across better at the dinner last night. He did, after poking fun at Mr. Gore for exaggeration and other political foibles, offer him the kind of compliments that politicians rarely give one another in public.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Let me tell you a few things that I've learned about my opponent in this campaign,'' Mr. Bush said. "He's a man who clearly loves and respect his wife and family. Like me, he married up. I also learned that he is a person of energy, skill and determination. This year, Mr. Vice President, I can't wish you success, but I do wish you well.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even Mr. Gore had to join the applause.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Voters generally judge this year's candidates favorably -- in fact, they give the field a better rating than they did in 1992 and 1996. But there is not a lot of strong feeling one way or the other about Al Gore versus George W. Bush. Neither man has been more able than the other to make a compelling case for his candidacy. Add to this the fact that the central question of most elections is not being raised. Voters are not being offered a referendum on the administration in power; that question is being sidestepped by both camps. President Clinton's name was hardly mentioned in the third presidential debate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The swing groups are likely to have a variety of reasons for coming to their final decisions. Some strongly favor Mr. Gore on health care and other high-anxiety issues, but have trouble with his personality. Others think Mr. Bush might provide a refreshing change in tone in Washington, but worry about his qualifications and some of his positions on issues.

  Mr. Gore continued to press the attack, charging that Gov. Bush's tax cut proposal would drain Social Security, raise interest rates and undermine economic growth by giving ''too much to too few at the expense of too many.''
 </textdata>

  Vice President Gore and George W. Bush, the Texas governor, have sparred over how to conduct trade talks. Mr. Gore, seeking to solidify support from labor unions, has repeatedly promised that he will not negotiate any new trade agreements unless they include language preventing labor or environmental abuses.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As he campaigns for the White House, Mr. Gore is expected to cite the Jordan agreement as the kind of trade accord he supports.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has said that the push to harmonize labor and environmental rules is fundamentally protectionist, geared to thwart trade rather than enhance it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In an unusual feat of bipartisanship, the project made allies of Vice President Al Gore; his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas; Mr. Bush's younger brother Jeb, the Republican governor of Florida, and farmers and environmental advocates.

  His race comes in a presidential election year, and Vice President Al Gore is expected to carry New Jersey easily, which can only help his fellow Democrat, Mr. Corzine. In addition, the out-of-state contributions that Mr. Franks might have received are being sent to Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Republican in neighboring New York who is fighting Hillary Rodham Clinton, the favored motivational tool for Republican fund-raisers everywhere.

  After Mr. Gore's second debate with Gov. George W. Bush, the president was irate. He told one friend that the vice president was getting bad advice from consultants, especially Carter Eskew and Robert Shrum, who seemed to Mr. Clinton to have coached all the fight out of him. But when the friend said, ''Why don't you just call him?'' the president said he didn't feel he should meddle.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Former Clinton aides have said that one big reason Mr. Clinton chose Mr. Gore as his running mate was that he had a lot in common with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But now, Mr. Clinton is left to wonder why Mr. Gore can't be more like his wife, who appeared with the vice president at a campaign event in New York yesterday. As a candidate, she does listen to his advice -- and not coincidentally, in the view of several Clinton aides, seems to be doing better in her race than the vice president is in his.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It took last week's outbreak of violence in the Middle East to bring Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton together. The vice president left the campaign trail to attend White House briefings on the crisis. It was the first time Mr. Gore had set foot in the White House since a state dinner on May 22, and he seems to be going out of his way to avoid appearing with the president. His office was even reluctant to release a photo taken last week of the two of them together -- and initially instructed the White House not to put it out, either.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One Democratic fund-raiser who knows both men said, ''It's worse than you think, worse than it was last year.'' Even then, things weren't so hot. On the day Mr. Gore formally declared his candidacy in June 1999, ABC News broadcast an interview with the vice president in which Mr. Gore repeatedly distanced himself from the president, voicing disappointment over Mr. Clinton's behavior with Monica S. Lewinsky, the  White House intern with whom he had an affair.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Clinton feels frustrated, eager to help but unwilling to insert himself where he's not wanted, say the friends who have discussed this with him. It's beyond him why Mr. Gore can't manage to relate to an audience in the way that comes so effortlessly to him. And he's convinced that Mr. Gore moved too slowly to capitalize on his successful convention performance -- in the president's view, running away from him when he ought to be running on their record.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yesterday, at a meeting of the House Democratic caucus, Mr. Clinton responded to Mr. Bush's remarks in the last debate point for point and seemed to wish he had been there to make the arguments himself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I almost gagged when I heard that answer on the patients' bill of rights in Texas,'' Mr. Clinton said at one point -- Mr. Bush's answer, of course.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet there is no plan for Mr. Clinton to campaign with Mr. Gore, although he will be stumping for him and other Democrats, said Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane. ''This is something Gore is going to do on his own,'' Mr. Lehane said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And that is what has Mr. Clinton worried. He is concerned that a loss would reflect poorly on him, and aware, too, that he is responsible for some of Mr. Gore's problems. Yet the president also believes that he has left Mr. Gore a rich legacy, in both policy and political terms, and that Mr. Gore seems to be squandering it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gore aides, however, see the distance as a must. ''He said at the convention, 'I am my own man, vote for me.' That's real,'' said Mark Fabiani, the deputy campaign manager. ''It's not some kind of facade where behind it he's seeking Clinton's counsel every day.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Clinton called Mr. Eskew, Mr. Gore's top strategist, a couple of weeks ago to tell him he ought to make the vice president watch a skit about the first debate on NBC's ''Saturday Night Live,'' in which Mr. Gore was depicted as overbearing and orange.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A couple of times a week, the president speaks with William M. Daley, the Gore campaign chairman who was Mr. Clinton's former commerce secretary. Mr. Daley said that Mr. Clinton's questions about campaign strategy usually concerned ''big picture'' matters like television ads.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore is introverted by nature, highly rational in his decision-making, someone who spends virtually all his free time with his family. He is a man who has been heavily influenced by the women in his life -- his mother, his wife, his daughters -- but also by a rich, difficult and defining relationship with his father, the senator.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What bonding there was between him and Mr. Clinton -- an extroverted, instinctive, guy's guy who never knew his own father -- almost certainly centered on public policy. Mr. Gore definitely does not share the president's passion for politics. And -- this is not unimportant -- he does not even play golf.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Among the slights perceived by the president is that not only are few Clintonites on the Gore campaign, but that the team is chock-a-block with people who have gone out of their way to criticize Mr. Clinton, starting with Joe Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Peretz said about Mr. Gore that ''Even though he had a hard relationship with his father, he also had unconditional love, while Clinton didn't have this with his father,'' who died before he was born. ''My guess is Clinton resents Al, and that's why I think he's stuck it to him on occasion.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some Clinton aides suggest that the relevant resentment cuts the other way, that it is Mr. Gore who envies Mr. Clinton's political skills and is too proud to admit he needs help from the acknowledged master.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton have each made public comments that showed some ambivalence about the other. Mr. Clinton once told The Times that Mr. Gore's campaign had gotten off to a sluggish start and that he had been advising him to loosen up.
 </textdata>

  Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton were never particularly close, but after ''Tipper's people put out that she and the girls were appalled'' by the Lewinsky matter, Mrs. Clinton never forgot it, a friend of the first lady said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore and Clinton children had never been any more than polite, either, several family friends said. Though Sarah Gore and Chelsea Clinton are the same age -- college seniors now -- they never made much of a connection.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even Mrs. Gore's normally tight-lipped spokeswoman, Camille Johnston, spoke disparagingly of Mrs. Clinton in a recent interview, comparing the two women while making a point about how little Mrs. Gore cares about her public image.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''With Mrs. Clinton, there was always such a concerted effort with image,'' Ms. Johnston said. ''She went from housewife to cookie lady to whatever. Mrs. Gore hasn't done that, so it's easier. She hasn't had to turn into somebody else.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And the Gores' oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, answered frankly when asked if the first lady and her mother are friends: ''They've definitely had a personal relationship,'' she said, using the past tense. ''Obviously, the last eight years seems like a lifetime. But they call each other on important occasions.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A lifetime ago, as Ms. Schiff says, way back in 1992, Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore didn't know one another terribly well.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Though they came from the same part of the country, the two men had only met once, at Little Rock's Excelsior Hotel in 1987, when Mr. Gore was running for president and went to Mr. Clinton to ask for his endorsement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000

 <textdata>
  Their identical aspirations made them natural competitors -- and Mr. Gore seemed to have jumped ahead -- said Mr. Gore's cousin, Ark Monroe, who escorted him to the meeting.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore told the governor that they should consider one another natural allies, two southern moderates who could help hold their party together. If he was elected, Mr. Gore said, it wouldn't hurt Mr. Clinton's chances but would bolster them. He'd be paving the way, see?

  The meeting went fine, said Mr. Monroe, a longtime friend of Mr. Clinton. ''I always kind of thought they'd be rivals, but they seemed to get along.'' Mr. Gore did not get the endorsement, though.

  And the next time the two met, it was Mr. Clinton who was paving the way. Mr. Gore had just written his environmental book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' which had greatly impressed the governor. On the June night in 1992 that Mr. Clinton interviewed Senator Gore about joining him on the Democratic ticket, they talked for three hours and got pretty wonky, according to a former Gore aide. Before long, they were comparing favorite economists, and were soon telling friends that this partnership was not only going to work, but was going to be great.

  ''They saw the campaign and the issues the same way; they have scarcely any differences on policy, and that's of enormous importance to the two of them,'' said Reed Hundt, who attended St. Albans with Mr. Gore and Yale Law School with Mr. Clinton, who later named him chairman of the Federal Communications Commission at Mr. Gore's urging.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000

 <textdata>
  ''Clinton was digging it, and there was no jealousy and no backbiting. But there were people sticking the knife in Gore -- the Gephardt crowd and the Hillary crowd.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  George Stephanopoulos, a close Clinton aide, was a leading skeptic, since he had worked for both Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis, neither of whom had appreciated the rough treatment they got from Mr. Gore during the 1988 primary campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But, former White House aides recall, it was Mrs. Clinton who drove the first wedge between the two. Even before the election, her loyalists began jockeying to protect her position as first adviser -- and even tried to kick Mr. Gore off the bus, though he refused to budge.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Susan Thomases, a longtime friend of Mrs. Clinton, who had words with Mr. Gore not long after he was named to the ticket, denied there was ever any rivalry. ''No one tried to kick him off'' the bus, she said. ''He was just initially reticent about it, that being his personality, and then he stayed on and on and on. I don't know why so much was made of that.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But someone who has known both the Clintons well since the 1970's and has worked with Mr. Gore -- and has been disillusioned by all three of them -- said that Mrs. Clinton had worked hard to curb Mr. Gore's power from the start. ''Early on, Gore thought he would have much more influence,'' this person said. ''But she put a stop to that.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Despite the conflicts, Mr. Gore at least arguably still had more responsibility than any previous vice president. And not without some reason.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a recent interview, Mr. Gore said he agreed to join the ticket in part because he felt he could make not just a difference but perhaps the difference in the race.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Pollsters did find that Mr. Gore's presence on the ticket made people feel better about voting for Mr. Clinton. His conservative persona and placid, no-surprises-here personal life seemed to offset concerns about Mr. Clinton's character, and his experience, particularly on foreign policy, eased worries that Governor Clinton was a little weak in this area. Stan Greenberg, then Mr. Clinton's and now Mr. Gore's pollster, recommended constant references to the Clinton-Gore ticket and commercials that showed both men.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The president agreed to hand over real power -- enormous policy and personnel responsibilities -- as well as to include Mr. Gore and his staff in all important meetings. Mr. Clinton also promised to lunch with him privately, every week, no matter what.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Once they took office, technology and the environment became part of Mr. Gore's portfolio, along with the ''re-inventing government'' streamlining project and a heavy foreign policy role. And Mr. Gore was able to position loyalists throughout the executive branch.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet the turf battles between Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton intensified in the West Wing, where their surrogates fought over everything from media attention to office space.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A former administration official said that the only time he saw Mr. Gore lose out on a policy issue was in 1993, when he opposed health care reform and obliquely took on Mrs. Clinton.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The president was moving ahead but a lot of us thought there hadn't been proper economic or political vetting,'' the official said, and Mr. Gore urged him to go to the president and make their case. ''It was the only time he felt he couldn't go himself,'' said the former official, who is no longer in contact with either man, ''and that's because it involved her.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Clinton relied heavily on him, especially at this time, presidential aides said. Mr. Gore stiffened Mr. Clinton's resolve against Republican efforts to dismantle environmental regulations, zealously raised campaign funds, as the world now knows, and even made it his business to make sure the cabinet secretaries stayed on message. ''He was relentless,'' said the former consultant, who has no ties to or affinity for Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In 1996, the vice president's support of the welfare-reform bill was considered decisive. ''Gore was clearly telling the president to sign the Republican bill, even though it was punitive,'' said Mr. Reich, who strongly opposed the bill. ''There were very, very few voices inside the administration telling Clinton to sign the bill, and Gore was the adviser in chief, the most important voice in favor of signing.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One key to their relationship was that Mr. Gore was not afraid to disagree with the president. He was also often the only person in the room who could cajole Mr. Clinton out of a mood, White House aides said. In mock news conferences where staff members threw out questions to prepare him for the real thing, Mr. Clinton would sometimes get agitated by a hardball question. He'd vent for a few minutes, then Mr. Gore, on cue, would say something like, ''That's right, Mr. President, answer it just like that. That would be perfect'' -- and they'd laugh and the storm clouds would pass.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  These lunches were definitely not social occasions. ''Clinton would just go in and sit down and Gore would come with a foot-and-a-half stack of books,'' said this official. Mr. Gore has said the lunches almost always touched on environmental policy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Several former Clinton aides with no ties to Mr. Gore said that his influence on the president has often been understated. He brought Mr. Clinton around on the importance of environmental issues, they said. During the budget negotiations with Republicans that led to the government shutdown., he successfully argued that the environment should be one of the areas on which the administration would not compromise.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When the scandal hit, one friend of the vice president said, Mr. Gore at first believed the president, and even defended him to Tipper and his daughters, who did not. When the truth became known, Mr. Gore felt betrayed; the president had lied to his face in the Cabinet meeting in January 1998 when the the president said there was nothing to the story. But then, a Clinton friend said that the president also felt betrayed by Mr. Gore -- abandoned when he needed him most.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Publicly, of course, Mr. Gore stood outside the White House after Mr. Clinton was impeached and said his boss would be remembered as one of the nation's greatest presidents. Standing right behind the vice president as he spoke, Hillary Clinton nodded her head vigorously at every word Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But privately, said a friend of Tipper Gore, the vice president was sickened. ''He has daughters,'' this friend said. ''That was a moment Gore lost a great deal of respect for him.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Until last year, that is, when both Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton began revving up their respective campaigns, and their history began to repeat itself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But it was a relief in some ways, too, this same official said. Finally, there could be physical as well as emotional separation from the president: ''Gore had the cover to go out on the campaign.''

  Provisions of an appropriations bill expected to be approved in the next few days would make filtering software a condition for grants under the E-rate program, which subsidizes Internet connections for schools and libraries.

  Fortified by new radio and television commercials that trumpet his ''America first'' themes, he is concentrating on states where he sees weakness or at least vulnerability in the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Among them are New York and California, and also Minnesota, where Mr. Buchanan spoke to an audience of several hundred today at the University of Minnesota Law School.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is in states that Mr. Bush is not likely to win, Mr. Buchanan said, that he has a better chance to convince voters sympathetic to his views that their support would not be wasted on a third-party candidate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''George Bush has written off New York State,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ''So a vote for Bush there is a wasted vote. But a vote for Pat Buchanan can help accomplish something:  fighting for a third party, building a new party that doesn't poach or thieve but offers the American people something new.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His concern, of course, which he readily acknowledged, is that for now the country appears unready to embrace a third party, either his on the right or Ralph Nader's Green Party on the left. Mr. Nader has polled somewhat better than Mr. Buchanan in most national surveys, reaching as high as 4 percent in some, causing more concern for Vice President Al Gore than Mr. Buchanan has caused for Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For all his triumphs in the Reform Party, one failure still rankles: the inability to convince the Commission on Presidential Debates that he and Mr. Nader deserved a place on the stage with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore these last two weeks. Had he managed to prevail, Mr. Buchanan said, polls would have shown him ''in the teens right now, the upper teens.''

  Mr. Freeman says President Clinton ''cannot restart the peace process, and his successor, whoever he is, will have to rebuild trust with both sides.'' Yet if George W.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The economic policies my opponent has put forward in this election are not just unfair, they're unsound, and they would hurt our economy,'' Mr. Gore declared at a noon speech in the soaring rotunda of Columbia University's Low Library.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Governor Bush's plan gambles with our prosperity by bringing back deficits, draining Social Security, delaying debt reduction and fueling higher interest rates,'' he said, adding that the governor's tax cut proposal would ''lavish more on those who need it least.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his speeches to date, Mr. Gore has generally portrayed himself as the more responsible steward of the nation's economy, and he did so again yesterday. But in increasing signs that the economy will be the central issue in the election, both candidates have been escalating their predictions of how the other would ruin the prosperity, and Mr. Gore took his oratory to new heights.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''My opponent's plan really does pose a threat,'' the vice president said. ''These are not personal differences. I'm not questioning Governor Bush's heart, I'm questioning his priorities.''

  Flying into New York late Wednesday night, reporters asked Mr. Gore if he was rooting for the Yankees or the Mets.

  But all was cheerful on the television sets. Ms. O'Donnell, an unabashed Gore promoter, captured the tone by announcing, ''This is going to be a very pro-Gore day.''

  Early this evening, Mr. Gore attended a raucous rally with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, his running mate, and Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the Senate in New York. Thousands of people jammed a midtown hotel for the rally, sponsored by the Service Employees International Union. Mrs. Clinton appealed to the crowd to get out the vote for the ''Gore/Lieberman/Clinton ticket.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At Columbia, Mr. Gore was introduced by Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary. Mr. Rubin told the audience of a few hundred people that Mr. Gore was ''at the center'' of the difficult economic choices made by the Clinton administration. He said Mr. Bush's proposals would take the nation on the ''wrong path.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his speech, Mr. Gore pledged to ''underspend'' the surplus, balance the budget and eliminate the national debt. He also insisted that he would not, as Mr. Bush has charged, expand the size of government.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You'd better believe that the era of big government is over,'' he said. He pledged that in a Gore administration, he would take government spending to ''the smallest share of national income in 50 years.''

  On ABC's ''Live With Regis,'' Mr. Gore demonstrated how as a teenager he hypnotized chickens, using Mr. Philbin as the stooge. The vice president, standing behind Mr. Philbin, circled his finger around the talk-show host's head, declared him under and intoned this message: ''Regis, between now and Nov. 7, you will say good things about the Gore/ Lieberman ticket.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. O'Donnell asked about Mr. Clinton, giving Mr. Gore a chance to debunk any negative association with Mr. Clinton's sex scandal that might linger among her primarily female audience.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I hope it hasn't, because I am who I am,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I condemned his personal mistake. I do so again. He's my friend. We've worked together, we've been able to do some good things for the American people. I'm not trying to make this race about the past. It really is about the future.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is also to appear in the skit as himself. The script has Mr. Bush saying that he is offended by some of the material on the show, and Mr. Gore then says: ''I was one the very first to be offended by material on 'Saturday Night Live' and I'm glad to see the governor has joined with me in condemning it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Governor Bush has very different priorities. Instead of underspending the surplus, he overspends it. He starts with a $1.6 trillion tax cut that gives too much to too few at the expense of too many. Then he adds about a half a trillion dollars in new spending. Then he privatizes Social Security, which would cost another trillion dollars.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The choice couldn't be clearer. Under my plan, zero deficits and a zero national debt within 12 years. Or a Bush plan that would leave us with a $1.1 trillion deficit in our non-Social Security accounts over the next 10 years, would raise interest rates and could undermine economic growth. . . . Sound fiscal policy sends a signal of reassurance to our markets, and my budget surplus reserve fund is a hedge against the possibility that even today's best projections of economic growth might turn out to be overly optimistic. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Let's cut to the heart of the matter. Both sides in this election have proposed targeted tax cuts. The difference is, my plan targets the middle class; the Bush plan targets the wealthy. In fact, the other night in our debate, Governor Bush was asked directly by the moderator whether what I was saying about his plan was correct and whether his plan 'benefits the top 1 percent of wealthiest Americans.' His answer? 'Of course it does.' . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And just yesterday, we learned that there's some confusion in the Bush campaign about how soon Social Security will be in deficit under their plan. . . . In this week's debate, I asked the governor to address this confusion. But when he tried to explain his proposal, his own chief economist said, 'I don't know why he said what he said.' . . .

  It started like a normal night on the ''Late Show with David Letterman.'' Expecting Gov. George W. Bush as his guest, Mr. Letterman quizzed an audience member about Texas. He showed footage of the governor emerging from a black car. He brought up Mr. Bush's open-mike faux pas about a reporter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But quickly after that Mr. Letterman had a surprise for anyone who was expecting a normal night of comedy -- and from the look of it, Mr. Bush was also surprised. The host sharply questioned the Republican presidential candidate on the death penalty, violence in the Mideast and pollution in Texas. And he hardly seemed to be joking, even though he punctured his questions with his trademark laugh.

  Mr. Bush did get in some good lines. Asked whether he thought he had done well in the debate, he said, ''Well, a lot of folks don't think I can string a sentence together so when I was able to do so, the expectations were so low that all I had to do was say, 'Hi, I'm George W. Bush.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000

  But soon Mr. Letterman was bearing in on the death penalty, saying, ''We make a lot of jokes about you electrocuting people in Texas,'' and asking whether there was some circumstance that would change Mr. Bush's position on capital punishment.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Well, obviously if the system were unfair, I'd think about it'' Mr. Bush said. ''You know it's a serious business. I hope that you're not laughing at the expense of victims or other people who are put to death of course.''
 </textdata>

  A taping of a ''Saturday Night Live'' to be shown the weekend before Election Day went more as planned.

  The Ridgewood Diner, a dumpy little joint beneath the shadow of the elevated M train, is just one place among many inflamed with baseball fever. It sits on the border of Ridgewood, which straddles Queens and Brooklyn, and Bushwick, in Brooklyn. They are two ethnically different neighborhoods hanging beside each other in the middle of the city like a bedsheet draped across the clothesline of Myrtle Avenue.

  The regular folks of Bushwick and Ridgewood are clearly caught up in the Subway Series games. At the 83rd Precinct, the scratchboard in the conference room is covered with trash-talking taunts that hack at both teams. At St. Barbara's Church, parishioners bicker over the Mets and the Yankees even during Mass.

  What of Dick Cheney, Al Gore and George W. Bush? Mr. Cheney tells it straight: he's a longtime Yankee fan. But Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are taking a slide on this one.

  THE TWO E's  Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, making another in a series of environmental speeches, said yesterday that Democrats were committed simultaneously to protecting the environment and promoting economic growth, but that Republicans believed it was impossible to do both. With new technology, Mr. Lieberman argued, it is possible to slow global warming and make the nation more energy efficient without hurting the economy. Speaking in New York to the national convention of the League of Conservation Voters, he said that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore had managed over the past seven years to block many attempts to weaken environmental protections. But, he warned, ''if George Bush is elected president, I fear that those same measures will be welcomed on a red carpet through the front door of the White House.''

  President Clinton joined in the criticism yesterday, though he restricted his comments to a contention by Mr. Bush in Tuesday's debate about a 1997 Texas law that allowed patients to sue health maintenance organizations for denying coverage.

  The comments by Mr. Kerrey and other lawmakers came a day after Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, William M. Daley, visited Capitol Hill to meet with Congressional leaders. Several senators told Mr. Daley that the debates had convinced them that an effective political argument should be made against Mr. Bush's capacity for presidential leadership, and Mr. Daley encouraged them to make it, officials in Congress and the Gore campaign said.

  The campaign has tried to make that case in recent weeks through its spokesmen. One of them, Chris Lehane, said last week that Mr. Bush would be ''held to presidential standards when it comes to describing his policy views,'' and asserted that ''thus far he has not met the Quayle standard,'' a reference to former Vice President Dan Quayle.

  Steve Elmendorf, the chief of staff to Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, said leaders in each house would question Mr. Bush's leadership in news conferences, floor speeches and media interviews. ''As people have watched these debates, they have come in with a real sense that this is something we've got to talk about,'' Mr. Elmendorf said.
 </textdata>

  Like Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Elmendorf said House members would not question Mr. Bush's intellect. ''Being president requires a lot more than brains,'' Mr. Elmendorf said. ''But particularly when you put him up against Gore, you can question his experience and ability to lead.''

  ''The governor is very proud of how he has brought people together in a bipartisan way to lead and get things done in Texas,'' Mr. Fleischer said.

  Mr. Kerrey said he was particularly concerned about Mr. Bush's ability to handle complicated trade, defense and foreign policy matters.

  Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, also speaking in a telephone interview, made a similar point by noting the complexity of the annual negotiations over appropriations bills. ''I read where Governor Bush doesn't like meetings of more than 15 minutes and one sheet of paper kind of things,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''These negotiations get so complex that the president really needs to know the details.''

  Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are counting on the good luck to last. They propose to use up -- in tax cuts and new spending -- nearly all of the surplus projected by the Congressional Budget Office over the next 10 years. The projections of the budget office, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress, assume that the mix of fortuitous circumstances that swung the budget from deficit to surplus will continue over the next decade, at least on the revenue side. That would happen even if the economy slowed, the budget office estimates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That assumption goes unchallenged by Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush -- although the recent sell-off in the stock market, if it continues, could eventually undermine tax revenue. The candidates accept the surplus projections of the budget office, although Jason Furman, a senior economist in the Gore camp, says that to be on the safe side, Mr. Gore's proposals would fall $300 billion short of spending the entire $2.2 trillion in surpluses projected by the budget office through 2010.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is taking the budget office projection on faith. ''What else can a politician do but rely on the best estimates?'' said Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The $2.2 trillion surplus does not include Social Security, which is expected to generate an additional surplus of $2.4 trillion by 2010. Mr. Gore would put this extra money aside to help pay retirement benefits when Social Security is projected to start running deficits in about three decades. Mr. Bush would put aside slightly more than half, but use about $1 trillion to finance individual retirement accounts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000

 <textdata>
  Congress set the stage a decade ago for the budget surpluses appearing today. Tax rates rose for the wealthiest Americans as a result of  legislation in 1990, when Governor Bush's father was president, and in 1993, under President Clinton. A 1997 law undid some of the 1993 tax rate increases, but tax rates on wealthy Americans were still sharply higher when the economy suddenly roared ahead in 1996. The boom lifted nearly everyone's taxable income, but a far larger share of the gain -- in the form of stock options and bonuses as well as higher pay -- went to people with taxable incomes above $200,000.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But if tax revenue has grown faster than the economy itself and well above historical trends, in the view of the Congressional Budget Office, spending certainly has not. The spending restraint also fattened the surplus, but now seems in conflict with some of the stated plans of Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush.

  ''I will stay here with you,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''If we don't finish by Wednesday, we're going to day-by-day continuing resolutions.'' He also used the meeting to criticize Gov. George W. Bush for comments in Tuesday's debate about a patients' bill of rights in Texas.

 <textdata>
  ON THE SCREEN -- Opens with pictures of Mr. Bush. Shifts to shots of dollar bills streaming by, followed by a pensive-looking older woman. Flashes the front page of The Wall Street Journal, and closes with a picture of Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  THE SCRIPT -- Announcer: ''What would George W. Bush's plan do to Social Security? He's promising to take a trillion dollars out of Social Security so younger workers can invest in private accounts. Sounds good. The problem is: Bush has promised the same money to pay seniors their current benefits. The Wall Street Journal shows he can't keep both promises. Which promise is he going to break?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ACCURACY -- The commercial is correct in saying that Mr. Bush is proposing to take $1 trillion out of the revenues from the payroll tax that finances Social Security benefits. That money would go to help establish accounts through which individuals could invest in stocks and bonds for retirement. But the commercial is somewhat misleading in its implication that Mr. Bush's plan would not leave enough money to pay current retirees.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Social Security is taking in more money than it needs to pay benefits, although that situation will reverse in 15 years. Because of the complex way in which the government accounts for Social Security revenues, there is enough money available to pay benefits even if $1 trillion is diverted to private accounts in the next decade. On the other hand, Mr. Bush's plan would arguably move up the date at which the federal government would need to begin using general tax revenues to help pay benefits to current retirees.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  SCORE CARD -- The Gore campaign has been frustrated by its inability to make Mr. Bush pay a political price for his Social Security proposal, which would be the biggest change to the retirement system since its inception. The commercial tracks the theme Mr. Gore has emphasized on the stump for the last few days, that there is a price to be paid for the approach Mr. Bush is advocating. In political terms, the commercial is clearly intended to suggest that older people -- who reliably vote against tinkering with Social Security -- have something to fear from Mr. Bush. In doing so, it opens Mr. Gore to accusations of using scare tactics.

  Mr. Gore has been to a million town halls like the one on TV Tuesday. His  questioners usually try to go for his strong suit, the cerebral. A man this week asked him to recompute the rate of return on Social Security. Mr. Bush has been to a lot of town halls this year too, but the questions tend to be less demanding. ''Can I have a hug?'' a woman asked the other day. Hugging is, of course, what governors do. But it is not all that great of a preparation for standing on national television and having an average citizen ask whether you actually enjoy executing murderers.

  He described his opponent as the sort of guy who will ''just talk and talk and give all these fancy words. . . .'' This is how you know a campaign is coming near the end -- when Al Gore starts warning people about George W. Bush, that silver-tongued devil with the stuck-up vocabulary.

  Seated in the audience was Winnie Skinner, the elderly Iowan who became a star after she told Mr. Gore that she pays for her prescription drugs by collecting recyclable cans. Like a lot of Mr. Gore's examples of true-life woe, Ms. Skinner's lot turned out to be not quite so bad as it seemed at first. Her son in Texas informed the press that he had plenty of money and was perfectly willing to help out his mother, if only she'd let him.
 </textdata>

  Everybody loves spunky old ladies with attitude. But in the great scheme of things, it's hard to see Ms. Skinner as the reason we need a multibillion-dollar prescription drug program for the elderly. If Mr. Gore loses, we may look back and conclude that his fatal error was that his Real People had too much money. It's easy to locate impoverished seniors or schools without enough desks. But finding them in middle-class neighborhoods in swing states is a challenge.

  Both presidential candidates used their final debate this week to set up their stretch drives to the election. Gov. George W. Bush proclaimed himself the cure for partisan bickering in Washington and painted Vice President Al Gore as a big-spending, big-government liberal. But Mr. Gore came away with two overriding issues to exploit in the closing weeks. He hammered away at Mr. Bush's tax giveaway to the rich, and he forced Mr. Bush to acknowledge that his partial privatization of Social Security would divert $1 trillion from the surplus into private accounts, siphoning off funds that will be needed in the future to pay benefits to retirees.

  Federal spending. Governor Bush distorted reality when he said that Mr. Gore's campaign proposals added up to ''the largest increase in federal spending in years.'' The Bush campaign cited figures this week to show that the Gore program would raise federal spending, in terms of dollars, by more than at any time since the Great Society program of the 1960's. But that is a misleading measure. President Johnson's programs raised federal spending as a percentage of national income, from 17 to over 21 percent. The Gore program would head in the opposite direction. Federal spending as a percentage of national income would fall, from about 18 percent to less than 17.5 percent by 2010, the lowest level since the mid-1960's. That can hardly be described as big government run amok.

  Tax cuts. Mr. Gore made it clear that he would continue to pound Mr. Bush for proposing tax cuts that would primarily benefit the richest 1 percent of the American population. Mr. Bush tried to parry the thrust by saying that the share of taxes paid by wealthy families would actually rise under his plan, to 64 percent from 62 percent. But his figures apply only to income taxes. Low- and many middle-income families pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes, and payroll taxes would not be cut a dime under the Bush plan. Mr. Bush also calls for gutting the estate tax, which is paid almost entirely by the richest families. So even if wealthy families pay a slightly larger fraction of income taxes under the Bush plan, they will pay a lower share of all federal taxes.

  Social Security. The vice president sounded an important theme when he accused Mr. Bush of financial legerdemain -- promising to use $1 trillion to set up private retirement accounts while needing to use the same dollars to pay current retirees. Mr. Gore's accusation applies more to the future than to the present. For the next few years, Social Security will run huge surpluses, providing enough money to create private accounts and to pay retirees. But those surpluses are temporary, and eventually Mr. Bush must find dollars to serve both purposes. Indeed, to make his program work he will be forced to cut benefits well below current guarantees, raise taxes or borrow, an issue he refuses to confront.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush wants to create the private retirement accounts alongside the existing public trust fund by diverting, say, a sixth of the current Social Security payroll tax. He defends the idea by saying that workers currently get only a ''paltry'' 2 percent return -- in terms of future retirement benefits -- on the money they pay in payroll taxes. But, he says, they could easily earn at least twice as much on private accounts invested in stocks and bonds. The comparison is highly misleading.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  More than 80 percent of the payroll taxes that workers pay into the common trust fund fly right back out to pay the benefits of current retirees. This money is never invested, earning a zero rate of return. The problem is that Social Security has promised to pay trillions of dollars to retirees in excess of taxes the system expects to collect in future years. These unfunded promises will not disappear under partial privatization. One way or another, taxpayers will foot the bill, making the private accounts far less attractive than Mr. Bush advertises.

  Still, the 90-minute event was briskly paced and the exchanges were often spirited and intense.

  The event opened on a somber note, with a moment of silence for Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, who was killed in a plane crash on Monday night. Mr. Carnahan, a Democrat, had been in a neck-and-neck race for the Senate with the incumbent, John Ashcroft.

  One of the more heated exchanges was over reducing the cost of prescription drugs. Mr. Bush said the elderly were entitled to government programs that encouraged health insurance plans to help with the costs of prescription drugs. Such programs cannot pass, Mr. Bush said, until there is change in Washington.

  ''There's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It's kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue. So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing and come together and take care of our seniors.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000

 <textdata>
  But he said he was against government-imposed price controls on drugs. ''I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The best thing is to reform Medicare.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore responded harshly. ''Here we go again,'' he said, trying to depict Mr. Bush as too close to drug companies. Pointing to Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore said that for voters who wanted a candidate who ''supports legislation supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The two also tangled over a national health care program. Mr. Gore said the country should move ''step by step toward universal health coverage.'' But he said he did not favor the government as the sole provider.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We have a big difference on this,'' he said, turning to Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I am absolutely opposed to a national health care plan,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I don't want the federal government making decisions for patients or providers.''

  In the last debate, Mr. Bush was criticized by some people for appearing to grin briefly when he talked about death penalty cases. Responding to a question last night, he said he was not proud of the fact that Texas had imposed the death penalty on more people than any other state in recent years. ''The death penalty is very serious business,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But, Mr. Bush said, the death penalty is appropriate when a defendant is guilty of a capital crime and has had full access to the courts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While not boasting of the number of executions, Mr. Bush said: ''I'm proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the state of Texas.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said he supported the death penalty ''in the most heinous cases.'' But, he said, it has to be administered fairly, with attention to DNA evidence.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was perhaps most passionate when he discussed education, an issue he has devoted much time to as governor. Asked how he would get parents more involved in the education of their children, he said, ''It's hard to make people love one another.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said he would offer hiring bonuses to help schools hire 100,000 teachers in the next four years. He said he would work for universal preschool programs. And he said Mr. Bush supported vouchers that could be used by parents to send their children to public or private schools.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Such vouchers would take money from public schools, Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Governor Bush is for vouchers,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and in his plan, he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money, out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore offered his remedies about how to improve schools but turned the issue to Mr. Bush's tax proposals. He said that Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan would make it difficult for the federal government to provide any increased aid to schools.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He proposes spending more money for the wealthiest 1 percent than he does spending on education, health and national defense combined,'' Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush replied that under his plan, the wealthiest taxpayers would pay 64 percent of the total tax payment, compared with 62 percent that he asserted they now pay.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is a fair plan,'' Mr. Bush said. Gesturing at Mr. Gore, he said, ''This is a big spender.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Mr. Gore said that independent journalistic analyses showed that his evaluation of the Bush tax plan was correct, Mr. Bush dismissed journalists as irrelevant. Mr. Gore said they were the ''keepers of the record'' of what was accurate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If you want a man emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man,'' he said turning to Mr. Bush. ''But if you want someone to fight for the middle class,'' he said,  choose the Gore-Lieberman ticket.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The debate veered to foreign policy when Mr. Bush was asked what would make him the best leader to deal with the Middle East.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the absence of further elaboration, Mr. Bush said the United States had to be ''credible, strong.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Israel's our friend,'' Mr. Bush said, quickly adding that he would reach out to Arab nations also. Whatever he did, Mr. Bush said, he would do with an eye on what is right, not what is popular at the moment.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For his part, Mr. Gore said he envisioned ''a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said that ''government ought to stand on the side of parents teaching their children right from wrong and the message is often undermined by pop culture. We can work with the entertainment on things like family hour.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore recalled how his wife, Tipper, who was in the audience, once discovered that one of their daughters brought home a record with lyrics he described as awful and she ''hit the ceiling.'' He noted that Mrs. Gore then began a successful campaign to have records labeled for content.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When a sixth-grade teacher said his students wanted him to ask the candidates if they would keep their pledges, Mr. Gore said, ''Yes,'' producing a ripple of laughter at his terseness. But it was only momentary as he added: ''I am a person who keeps promises and you know we've heard a lot about not being done much in the last eight years. I think the record shows otherwise.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush quickly picked up that theme, saying that the Clinton-Gore administration had promised many things. ''You were promised that Medicare would be reformed,'' he said. In addition, he said that there were promises to reform social security and provide a tax cut for the middle class. ''It didn't happen,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000

 <textdata>
  It was body language, and one of its messages was unmistakable: Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore do not like each other one bit.

 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore never actually verbalized this. But he strayed from his stool on the red-carpeted stage at one point and literally claimed Mr. Bush's territory as his own, shooting daggers at the Texas governor as Mr. Bush implied that the vice president was too partisan a politician to get anything done.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush never verbalized it, either. But one look at the tightness of his smile and the exasperated shrug of his shoulders whenever he believed that Mr. Gore was going overboard made his view of the vice president clearer than even the spiciest adjective could.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's desire seemed muted, sometimes curiously so, as he kept his hands closer to himself, covered less physical ground and let his features go slack, as if he were musing out loud rather than making a vigorous case.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was as obvious tonight as at any previous point during the campaign that Mr. Bush was betting heavily that voters, in a time of prosperity, preferred a folksy, sometimes shuffling politician to one with any strains of stridency.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, Mr. Bush spoke so softly at times that he seemed to be on the verge of slumber, and his answer to Mr. Gore's laser-beam stare was a wizened mien of bemusement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He also sought to direct voters' attention to what he clearly saw as an empty theatricality in the vice president by suggesting that Mr. Gore was too busy performing to provide the required, relevant responses.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''One reason people are skeptical,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to American's relationship to their government, ''is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What voters perhaps saw tonight, more vividly than in the first or second debate, were the divergent degrees of intensity that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush bring to the presidential contest. What voters were left to decide is which style will give them the kind of government they want.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore managed to mention that all four of his children had come, of their own volition, to the debate tonight. He managed to recite the entirety of his foreign-policy resume.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I didn't do the most or run the gravest risk by a long shot,'' Mr. Gore said, ''but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush seemed intent above all on not committing any errors, which meant staying relaxed, and he probably made a special effort in that direction, given what happened to his father eight years ago. Unnerved by precisely the kind of town-hall format that was used tonight, former President Bush stole glances at his wrist watch, to disastrous effect.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''One thing about insurance that's a Washington term,'' Mr. Bush said at one point, despite the fact that there is really no other word for it, and his proposals for people on Medicare involve precisely that.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Talking to a teacher in the audience about the way in which federal regulations sometimes hamper local schools, Mr. Bush said, ''I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-out-er.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore unfurled statistic upon statistic, putting his knowledge on full and self-conscious display. Mr. Bush leaned harder on generalities, answering a question about how parents could be made to take greater responsibility for their children's education by saying that he wished he could write and pass a law that would make people love each other.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He sometimes sounded like a greeting card. Mr. Gore occasionally sounded like the denizen of a think tank.

  Tomorrow, Archbishop Egan will step into national view when he presides over a venerable political event, the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner, a charity fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria sponsored by the archdiocese. The occasion represents the restoration of local tradition: for the first time in 12 years, the dinner will be attended by the presidential candidates of both major parties, in this case, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In 1992, a presidential debate was scheduled on the same night as the dinner, and President George Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton declined the invitation. Four years ago, the dinner's organizers invited neither President Clinton nor Senator Bob Dole because, some officials in the archdiocese said, Cardinal O'Connor was angered by Mr. Clinton's veto of a bill that would have banned a late-term abortion procedure.

  High school debate teams like Ms. Martin's, which won several rounds before being eliminated last weekend, have long trained the nation's elite in critical thinking and public presentation. Although aides to Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who debated on national television last night, said the candidates had not been on their high school teams, many politicians and public speakers cut their oratorical teeth in high school tournaments.

  It was perhaps the most direct question of the 90-minute session, and it elicited a direct response. ''No, I'm not proud of that,'' Governor Bush said, adding, ''If you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After the debate ended, Mr. Anderson had another direct response. ''I didn't like it at all,'' he said of Mr. Bush's answer.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Anderson was one of 131 people chosen by the Gallup Organization to question Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore in the town hall meeting here that served as the third and final presidential debate of the election season. Janet Brown, spokeswoman for the Commission on Presidential Debates, said the questioners were selected ''because they were uncommitted voters.'' Roughly one-third were truly undecided, while another third leaned toward Mr. Gore and another third leaned toward Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But, like others, Mr. Kosberg said afterward that he was still undecided on a presidential pick. The most useful part of the evening, he said, was that while he leaned Democratic, ''I'm pleased to realize that Governor Bush would make a wonderful leader.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The format did not allow the candidates to be overly chatty with the questioners. After the first question, Mr. Gore said in response, ''Mr. Hankin, I don't feel good about it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But later, when Mr. Gore tried to engage Mr. Kosberg, the teacher, by asking what grade he taught,  Mr. Lehrer swiftly stopped him, saying, ''That's a violation of your rule.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore afterward resisted his inclination to to try to engage people by asking them personal questions. On the subject of tax cuts, he said, ''Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year. I won't ask you. But if you do, you're in the top 1 percent. If you don't -- -- ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore conceded, ''I'm not going to ask.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush stuck to the rules and engaged his questioners by confining himself to simple hellos. ''Hi, Angie,'' he said when Angela K. Pettig, who asked a question about education, was introduced.

  THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PARTICIPANTS  Correction:  October 21, 2000, Saturday  An article on Wednesday about Gov. George W. Bush's criticism of Vice President Al Gore's economic plans misstated a question Mr. Bush was asked at the presidential debate on Tuesday. The moderator, Jim Lehrer, asked him to respond to Mr. Gore's criticism that the governor's proposed tax cut ''benefits the top 1 percent of the wealthiest Americans.'' Mr. Bush responded: ''Of course it does. If you pay taxes, you're going to get a benefit.'' Mr. Lehrer did not ask whether the proposal would benefit ''mainly'' that group.

  The senator strolled into the media center here an hour before the debate, and about 50 members of the news media, starved for something to report, mobbed him.

  With the exception of the third presidential debate in St. Louis tonight, Mr. Carnahan's death brought a halt today to much of the state's frenetic and often negative political campaigning. Mr. Ashcroft ordered his aides to pull his television advertisements indefinitely and canceled a busy day of campaigning. The Democratic National Committee also stopped running its television commercials in the state, while Vice President Al Gore canceled a Thursday rally in Kansas City that Mr. Carnahan had been scheduled to attend on Thursday. And both the Democratic and Republican candidates for governor suspended their campaigning and television commercials today.

  But beyond that, analysts said, the loss of the Missouri's most powerful and popular Democrat could also dampen Democratic turnout at the polls, hurting Mr. Gore and the party's gubernatorial candidate, State Treasurer Bob Holden.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A senior Gore adviser also said the party might have to spend more money in Missouri to turn out Democratic voters who might be dispirited by Mr. Carnahan's death.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Carnahan's death could even affect the fate of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president who is simultaneously running for re-election in Connecticut. Some Democrats have called on Mr. Lieberman to drop out of the Senate race before Oct. 27 so that the state's popular Democratic attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, can get on the ballot. Those Democrats are concerned that if Mr. Gore wins, Mr. Lieberman will resign from the Senate, allowing Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, to name his replacement.

 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Good evening from the field house at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm Jim Lehrer of The NewsHour on PBS. And I welcome you to this third and final Campaign 2000 debate between the Democratic candidate for president, Vice President Al Gore, and the Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Let's welcome the candidates now.

  Before we begin, a correction from last week's debate. I was wrong when I said Vice President Gore's campaign commercials had called Governor Bush a bumbler. That specific charge was made in a press statement by Gore campaign spokesman Mark Fabiani, not in a TV ad --
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Time is up. Two minutes response, Governor Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE -- -- in the Congress. And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingell-Norwood bill which is the main one pending.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, you may answer that if you'd like. But also I'd like to know how you see the differences between the two of you, and we need to move on.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- All right, another -- the next question also on a health issue. It's from, it will be asked by Marie Payne Clepey and it goes to Governor Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now, we have a big difference on this. And you need to know the record here. Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens. Last week he said that they were spending $3.7 billion -- or $4.7 billion on this.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, two minutes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now, I said there was a contrast. Governor Bush is for vouchers. And in his plan he proposes to drain more money -- more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for schools themselves. And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers. And they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school. I think that's a mistake. I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. I think we -- I think we should make it the No. 1 priority to make our schools the best in the world -- all of them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE -- Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described. Under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers that the federal government would put up. Now, here's -- and the way it would happen is that, under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to -- to match those -- that money.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- So no vouchers under -- in a Gore administration?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And then, I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning. But it all starts with the public school teachers. My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are -- who get certified to teach in the areas where they're most needed. Now, accountability? We basically agree on accountability. My plan requires testing of all students. It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't -- it requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach.

  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE -- Absolutely not. Absolutely not. I'm so glad that I have a chance to knock that down. Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy. Under his own budget numbers he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1 percent than all of the new money that he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined.

  10-18-2000

 <textdata>
  MR. GORE -- Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me. It is about you. And I want to come back to something I said before. If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.

 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- We're going to -- we're going to move on, we're going to have to move on. All right, there were 12 questions on foreign and military matters and the first one that we're going to ask will be directed to -- to you, Governor Bush. And David Norwood is going to ask it. Mr. Norwood, where are you? There you are.

  When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee. And while I was there, I worked on a bipartisan basis -- as I did in the House; I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry. In the Senate, I was one of only 10 Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War resolution. And for the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council --

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush opposes it. I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that. Because I think that the special interest have too much power and we need to give our democracy back to the American people. Let me tell you why. Those issues you mentioned -- Social Security, prescription drugs. The big drug companies are against the prescription drug proposal that I've made. The H.M.O.'s are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingell-Norwood bill that I support and that Governor Bush does not support. The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuels.

 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Good evening from the field house at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm Jim Lehrer of The NewsHour on PBS. And I welcome you to this third and final Campaign 2000 debate between the Democratic candidate for president, Vice President Al Gore, and the Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Let's welcome the candidates now.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000

 <textdata>
  Before we begin, a correction from last week's debate. I was wrong when I said Vice President Gore's campaign commercials had called Governor Bush a bumbler. That specific charge was made in a press statement by Gore campaign spokesman Mark Fabiani, not in a TV ad --
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Time is up. Two minutes response, Governor Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE -- -- in the Congress. And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingell-Norwood bill which is the main one pending.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, you may answer that if you'd like. But also I'd like to know how you see the differences between the two of you, and we need to move on.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- All right, another -- the next question also on a health issue. It's from, it will be asked by Marie Payne Clepey and it goes to Governor Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now, we have a big difference on this. And you need to know the record here. Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens. Last week he said that they were spending $3.7 billion -- or $4.7 billion on this.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, two minutes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now, I said there was a contrast. Governor Bush is for vouchers. And in his plan he proposes to drain more money -- more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for schools themselves. And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers. And they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school. I think that's a mistake. I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. I think we -- I think we should make it the No. 1 priority to make our schools the best in the world -- all of them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE -- Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described. Under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers that the federal government would put up. Now, here's -- and the way it would happen is that, under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to -- to match those -- that money.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- So no vouchers under -- in a Gore administration?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And then, I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning. But it all starts with the public school teachers.

  Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush dropped the pleasantries of their previous debate last night and held their most spirited confrontation to date while outlining their disagreements over tax cuts, health care, schools, campaign finance and other subjects. Taking questions this time before a ''town meeting'' audience, both the candidates put in vigorous performances, but it was Mr. Gore who dominated their exchanges. He offered a tighter, more cogent presentation of his policies and for the first time in weeks recaptured some of the passion of his Democratic convention speech. The Texas governor responded by promising to bring a new tone of bipartisan cooperation to Washington, but he seemed less at ease than in last week's debate in engaging the budgetary and legislative details laid out by Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Though most opinion polls show a close race, Mr. Bush has been running ahead of Mr. Gore in recent days. The difference has been magnified by their recent demeanor, with Mr. Bush looking more confident on the campaign trail and Mr. Gore seeming tentative and off his game. Last night, however, Mr. Gore dropped the almost phlegmatic manner he adopted last week, paced the large stage area and repeatedly challenged the governor directly with his answers. ''All right, here we go again,'' he said before dissecting Mr. Bush's first answer on drug prices, and that set the style for an evening marked by Mr. Bush's complaints that Mr. Gore was not following the debate ground rules.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On education, Mr. Gore dismissed the governor's proposals for testing with a wave of the hand and added that Mr. Bush's voucher plan would drain the public schools. On health care, he pointed at Mr. Bush and declared that if the voters wanted a program embraced by the drug companies, ''this is your man.'' Mr. Bush answered those thrusts with thematic responses depicting Mr. Gore as an exponent of big government. ''If this were a spending contest,'' he said, ''I'd come in second.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Over all, however, Mr. Gore was the aggressor and pace-setter. After last week's much-criticized performance he seemed willing, almost eager, to risk the possibility of some people's finding him unlikable. By being less reluctant to unleash a torrent of facts he seemed to throw Mr. Bush off balance, though the governor closed with a well-formed argument for sending a change agent to Washington.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's principal theme once again was that the vice president wanted to exploit issues for political gain rather than solve problems. He played down the policy differences between their two health plans, saying simply that the real ''difference is that I can get it done.'' But for the first time in their debates, Mr. Gore dwelled on the economic accomplishments of the last eight years and invited voters to ponder the risks of changing leadership.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The contrast between the two candidates on tax policy was especially sharp in an exchange over the estate tax. Mr. Gore said he favored removing the tax for most farm families and small businesses, but not the most wealthy. Mr. Bush was forced to argue for fairness for the very rich, and accused Mr. Gore of leaving 50 million Americans with no tax relief. Even on the issues of violence, pornography in popular culture and the death penalty -- traditional issues for Republicans -- Mr. Gore was more muscular in his response than Mr. Bush, who looked awkward when he gave a defensive answer about whether he was excessively keen on imposing the death penalty.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It may take several days before voters evolve a firm sense of who won the debate, but Mr. Gore's forces were sure to be energized by his return to form. He laid the groundwork for a final campaign push on the issue of Social Security by getting Mr. Bush to acknowledge that the $1 trillion program for private investment accounts for young working people would be taken from the Social Security surplus in coming years. The vice president is sure to keep the issue alive by charging that this money will not then be available for future retirees.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the biggest contrast could be seen in the way each candidate addressed the issue of trust. For Mr. Bush, trust was a question of who could end the bickering in Washington. Mr. Gore's more potent formulation was that Americans could trust him to ''fight for you'' against special interests. The next three weeks will determine which choice is preferred by voters.

  In tonight's presidential debate, Gov. George W. Bush presented himself as a champion of a patients' bill of rights in Texas, saying he ''brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the state of Texas.'' He made the same assertion in television commercials during the Republican primaries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000

 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush was rarely regarded as a leader on the issue in Texas, and his record is mixed.

 <textdata>
  In 1995, the State Legislature approved a patients' protection bill that would have required annual report cards for health maintenance organizations and would have forced them to provide necessary emergency-room care. Mr. Bush vetoed the measure, but he did instruct the state's insurance commissioner to draft rules covering some aspects of the bill, earning praise from some consumer advocates who had criticized his veto.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In 1997, lawmakers again pushed for a patients' bill of rights. In the debate, Mr. Bush spoke of supporting a provision that would make Texas the first state to allow patients to sue any H.M.O. for malpractice if it denied necessary care.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But during the 1997 legislative session, Mr. Bush was not initially so supportive of the lawsuit provision. He warned of a veto and came into  conflict with the bill's sponsor, Senator David Sibley, one of his staunchest Republican allies. Mr. Sibley even complained on the Senate floor about the governor's staff.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I can't make them happy no matter what I do, unless I completely gut the bill,'' said Mr. Sibley, who now credits Mr. Bush for being supportive of other patients' protection measures in 1997.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many Democrats described Mr. Bush as having little involvement on the overall bill.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Representative Patricia Gray, a Democrat, sponsored a bill requiring H.M.O.'s to allow women direct access to their obstetrician-gynecologists without having to see a ''gatekeeper'' doctor first. Mr. Bush mentioned the provision in the debate, but Ms. Gray has said he and his staff did little to help the bill.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Legislature approved the lawsuit provision by a wide margin. Mr. Bush allowed the provision to become law without his signature.

  Among the diverse political, cultural and religious leaders to throw their weight behind debt relief recently are Pope John Paul II; Pat Robertson, the Republican televangelist; Bono, singer of the Irish pop group U2, and George W. Bush. Their support tipped the balance in the Republican-led Congress, which had not previously offered much support for calls by developing countries for debt relief.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Republicans came under pressure this month from Mr. Bush, who championed debt relief in his second debate with Vice President Al Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000

  Vice President Gore has been a strong supporter of the administration's debt-relief plan.

  Gov. George W. Bush tried to paint Vice President Al Gore tonight as a traditional big-spending Democrat whose proposals would lead to a bigger, more intrusive federal government.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's spending plans, Mr. Bush asserted, are far bigger than anything proposed by President Clinton when he was running for office, and put even Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis to shame.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As is often the case when it comes to fiscal policy, there are different ways of evaluating Mr. Bush's claims. Looking at it one way, Mr. Bush has a point. Looking at it another way, Mr. Gore's response that government would actually shrink under his leadership is also credible.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is a big spender,'' Mr. Bush said of his rival, ''and he ought to be proud of it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Using his own figures, Mr. Gore has proposed about $1 trillion in new spending over the next decade. By the Bush campaign's estimate, Mr. Clinton's spending proposals when he first ran for president amounted to $800 billion over 10 years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Clinton was running when the federal budget deficit was hitting a record high, and both parties were constrained from proposing new programs. Mr. Gore is running against a backdrop of surpluses outside the Social Security system projected to be $2.2 trillion in the next decade.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In any case, Mr. Gore suggested that the better way to look at spending levels was relative to the size of the total economy. By that measure, he said, his proposals would put spending on a track that would leave it at its lowest level in 50 years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also said that under the Clinton administration, civilian government employment had fallen by 300,000. The number is actually closer to 400,000. But according to figures in the administration's most recent budget documents, most of the reduction -- 286,000 -- has come from the Pentagon, and is associated with the slimming of the military following the end of the cold war.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Absolutely not,'' Mr. Gore replied when asked whether he was a big spender.

  The debate over spending tonight was part of the campaign-long debate over how best to allocate the projected surpluses. Mr. Gore pressed his attack that Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan would leave little or no money for other priorities, including increased financing for education.

  ''Because the governor has all this money for a tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else,'' Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Moreover, Mr. Gore said, Mr. Bush would not allocate as much money as he would to paying off the national debt. Mr. Gore has pledged to pay off the $3.4 trillion debt in a dozen years.

  Mr. Bush said his tax cut would benefit the wealthy, since they pay the most taxes. But he said lower- and middle-income people would get proportionately more, a claim that is correct in percentage terms but not in dollar terms. And he suggested that the alternative to sending excess revenues back to taxpayers was to unleash a flood of new spending.

  ''If this were a spending contest, I'd come in second,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I readily admit, I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is.''

  Mr. McCollum did gain attention as one of the House impeachment prosecutors who made the case for conviction of President Clinton before the Senate. And at one point he was expected to receive a lift from the presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, brother of Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, and initially considered the solid favorite to lay claim to the state's 25 electoral votes. But  the Bush campaign has had to fight hard to try to hold off a strong Florida effort by Vice President Al Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McCollum concedes that he would have been helped had Mr. Bush led strongly throughout the race and then gone on to win here ''by 10 or 12 points.'' But, he adds, he never planned to run on Mr. Bush's momentum.

  ''This was going to be a walk for Bush,'' Mr. Nelson said, and if that had happened, ''I knew it was going to be difficult. It makes me a little more comfortable knowing Al Gore is doing so well.''

  Mr. Nelson and Mr. McCollum side with their parties' presidential nominees on most issues: the environment, the economy, education, abortion and more. Mr. McCollum backs  Mr. Bush's plan to apply a big part of the federal budget surplus to a $1.3 trillion tax cut; Mr. Nelson favors a $500 billion cut similar to the one proposed by Mr. Gore.

  But put me in an age-encrusted Irish pub some evening, among those unfailingly sociable and hospitable people, with the smell of peat hanging in the air, and I'll ask for a couple of fingers of Jameson. If I see Redbreast or Bushmills Malt behind the bar, I'll go for that in a nanosecond. Nothing, except maybe a pint of Guinness or Beamish, fits the time and place so well.
 </textdata>

  Midleton is also the site of the only large working distillery in the Irish Republic.  There's a much smaller upstart called Cooley's at Kilbeggan, County Clare, which makes three single malts -- Tyrconnell, Connemara and Knappogue Castle, the last a rich, creamy, vanilla-scented dream -- and a second big distillery at Bushmills, County Antrim, in Northern Ireland -- the world's oldest licensed distillery, in fact, chartered by James I in 1608.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A bit of background may be in order here. The brands most familiar in the United States, like Jameson and Bushmills, are produced by the same company, Irish Distillers, which since 1988 has itself been part of Pernod Ricard, the big French spirits group. Irish Distillers also makes Midleton Very Rare, Paddy and Powers, which is much the largest seller in Ireland but not as well known outside this country.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The brands differ sharply in formula and hence in flavor, and they command fervent followings, sometimes for reasons of taste, sometimes for political reasons (I know some fiercely patriotic Irishmen who won't drink Bushmills because of its connections with Ulster, and hence with Britain), sometimes for reasons of regional loyalty (former Prime Minister Jack Lynch, a Cork man, always ordered Paddy, originally a Cork whiskey, and expected those drinking with him to do likewise).
 </textdata>

  Single-malt Scotch -- that is, the unblended product of a single distillation -- and single-barrel and small-batch bourbon have achieved much greater currency than single-malt Irish. Irish Distillers produces only one, at Bushmills. It is available in both 12- and 16-year-old versions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000

 <textdata>
  A Bushmills Malt 16-year-old, matured in three woods, had a nutty nose and a thoroughly pleasant malty taste, all of a piece from start to finish.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Powers is the local favorite for making Irish coffee because of its hefty, honeyed flavor. Bushmills, smooth and unusually oaky in flavor, may be the best all-round standard brand, good on the rocks. Midleton Very Rare, made from casks individually selected by the master distiller, like a single-barrel bourbon, has a floral, herbal bouquet, a taste marked by notes of fruits and almonds and a velvety finish.
 </textdata>

  The standard brands of Irish whiskey -- Jameson, Bushmills and Midleton -- can be found in good liquor stores. More unusual bottles can often be found in Manhattan at Park Avenue Liquors, 292 Madison Avenue at 40th Street, and Crossroads Wine and Liquor, 55 West 14th Street.

  But how do you explain that long view to the public? The truth is that our leaders never really tried. Instead, even politicians who were trying to be responsible resorted to half-truths. All that business about putting Social Security and Medicare in ''lockboxes'' is an attempt to sell fiscal responsibility to the voters without really trying to explain why it is necessary. So maybe we should not be surprised that we have ended up with the worst of all worlds. On one side the public feels, correctly, that politicians like Al Gore, who use those half-truths to push for half-responsible policies, are talking down to them. On the other side the public feels, quite wrongly, that politicians like George W. Bush, who tell them that they can have their cake and eat it too, are men of the people.

  Mr. Bush's willingness to trust in the public's innumeracy continues to boggle the mind. In the second debate he offered possibly the biggest misrepresentation yet, this time declaring about his tax plan that ''most of tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.'' (That sound you hear is the giggling of millionaires and the guffawing of multimillionaires.)

  Federal workers invest in their Thrift Savings Plan atop a solid foundation of Social Security as it is currently financed, as well as the Federal Employees Retirement System.

  Predictably, the Gore campaign claimed that the new study ''devastates'' Gov. George Bush's education claims in Texas. But to draw that conclusion from this flawed and misleading study is wrong.

 <textdata>
  To the degree that this study draws attention to Governor Bush's record in Texas, we believe it should work to his advantage. He can rightly claim very impressive accomplishments in the area of education; the closer people look at the Texas record, the better it is. Nothing in the latest report contradicts this.

  But miners feel no less aggrieved, said Dick Kembler, president of Local 2935 of the United Mine Workers. Mr. Kembler is a lifelong Democrat who said he was voting Republican this year and bucking the national union's endorsement of Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Wise. He accused the Clinton administration of trying to finesse the issue, first siding with the lawsuit victors but then shifting positions as the court ruling came under appeal and the election approached.

  Without even taking up most of the big-ticket promises made by Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush in their race for the White House, the Republican-controlled Congress and President Clinton are negotiating over tax cuts and spending increases that could use up $900 billion or more of the projected non-Social Security surplus of $2.17 trillion over the next decade, the analysts said.

  Whatever the final figure, the allocation of such a big chunk of the surplus even before voters go to the polls suggests how quickly unimaginably large sums of money can come and go in Washington. And it is an indication that the agendas set out by Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush could prove overly ambitious even in this age of fiscal plenty.

  ''Each of the past three years, despite Congress and the president agreeing to spend more money, the surplus surged as a result of stronger than anticipated economic growth,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.

  On the campaign trail, the candidates continued to attack each other today over their budget proposals.

 <textdata>
  Aides to Mr. Bush said the report's assumptions were flawed and stood by their estimate that their proposal would pay off the debt by 2016. Mr. Gore, who says his plan would pay off the debt in 2012, said the report was evidence that Mr. Bush's agenda was fiscally irresponsible.

  ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial begins with a photograph of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president, and the words ''Thinking of voting for Ralph Nader?'' followed by the exterior of the Supreme Court building with the words ''Narrow Decision protects Roe v. Wade.'' Then a picture of a statue outside the court of a man representing the authority of law, and the words ''A single vote.'' Then the interior of the courtroom and photos of Governor Bush and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Mr. Bush's picture appears again, along with a gavel and the words ''Bush's Goal / End Legal Abortion.'' Then Mr. Nader's photo, Mr. Bush's photo and the Supreme Court exterior and finally the words  ''It's your choice.''

 <textdata>
  ''If you're thinking of voting for Ralph Nader, please consider: This year, a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision narrowly protected Roe v. Wade. A single vote saved a woman's right to choose. As president, George Bush would reverse the Court with anti-choice Justices Scalia and Thomas in control. Bush's goal? Ending legal abortion. Voting for Ralph Nader helps elect George W. Bush. Before voting Nader, consider the risk. It's your choice.''

  ACCURACY -- Mixed. The 5-to-4 decision invalidated a Nebraska law on the late-term procedure that opponents call partial birth abortion, and some advocates of abortion rights have said this means that the underlying Roe v. Wade decision of 1973 is imperiled. But many students of the Court believe the Roe decision retains the support of six justices. Mr. Bush has said Justices Thomas and Scalia are the sort he would nominate. They believe Roe should be reversed, as does Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.

  Mr. Bush has called for a constitutional amendment banning abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life is threatened -- a policy that would prohibit almost all abortions. But he has also said he does not believe that an amendment will be enacted soon.

  Echoing a line of attack that Mr. Bush has used against Vice President Al Gore presidential race, he also said the nation's armed forces had been hurt by cuts in defense spending and by being deployed on what he said were too many ill-defined overseas missions.

  The George W. Bush who's ending this campaign is a different candidate from the one who started it. Temperamentally, he's always been very even. (Given the fact that he's gotten virtually everything he's reached out for since his 40th birthday, a certain degree of sunniness seems like the least he could do.) But he no longer keeps referring every topic back to how they do things in Texas, and he's finally figured out how to explain his tax plan. At long last, he has applause lines. This has him so pleased and proud he's practically levitating.

  Except for a new fascination with prescription drugs for the elderly, Mr. Bush's issues are still the ones he was hammering away at during the primaries. The tax cut for wealthy Americans is still a matter of morality. (''It's the right thing to do! It's the right thing to give people's money back!'') He still avoids the sticky social issues, although in Florida the Boy Scouts suddenly popped up in his examples of the ''vast army of compassion'' the government has to encourage. He's still promising to end gridlock in Washington, as if he were an emissary from another continent preparing to negotiate a truce between the Gegs and the Tosks. He still promises to let the young'uns invest their Social Security money, and he is still not telling how much the government will cut their benefits in return.

  On paper, the candidates offer a stark choice: Vice President Al Gore is a supporter of abortion rights, while Mr. Bush is on record supporting a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the pregnant woman was in danger.

  David J. Garrow, a historian at Emory University and a scholar of the abortion rights movement, said, ''Abortion rights groups should not be surprised in the slightest that their voters do not seem frightened, because Governor Bush has consistently, for many months now, worked very hard to seem unfrightening to pro-choice voters.''

  Mr. Bush's political adroitness on the abortion issue has also involved giving enough quiet reassurance to right-to-life advocates that they have not revolted when, among other things, he has said he would not have a litmus test on the issue for his federal court nominees.

  ''Here's someone who openly professes to be pro-life, and on those issues that are politically possible, he's with us, whereas we know Al Gore to be hostile,'' said Richard Lessner, vice president of American Renewal, the lobbying organization associated with the conservative Family Research Council.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the other hand, Mr. Lessner added: ''There's never a guarantee.  We have to remember that the previous President Bush appointed Justice Souter, so there's a certain risk there.'' Justice David H. Souter proved to be a bitter disappointment to conservatives after he took the bench, often voting with the liberal bloc.

  Each side is campaigning hard at the grass roots. For the first time in its 84-year history, Planned Parenthood has plunged into presidential politics, with a $7 million advertising campaign focused on women in seven close states. ''I don't want government in my private life, telling me what to do,'' a woman says in one of the group's television commercials.  ''And that's why I have a problem with George W. Bush.''

  And this week the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, or Naral, said it would begin running commercials in swing states where Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential nominee, is strong.

  Indeed, each candidate is a lightning rod to the other side. Mr. Gore has become an unswerving supporter of abortion rights, with the whole-hearted support of abortion rights groups. Although he opposed federal spending for abortions in his early years in Congress, he reversed his position after he entered the Senate and has supported such spending for many years. Anti-abortion forces assert he abandoned his principles because of his national ambitions.

  Governor Bush has engendered similar contempt from abortion rights advocates for embracing his party's anti-abortion platform plank.  ''I am pro-life,'' he said in a statement to the National Right to Life Convention in June 1999.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  With those moves, Governor Bush allayed most doubts on the right about his commitment to the cause.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush has also tried to allay the fears of more centrist voters by suggesting that a constitutional amendment is a very distant goal. (In fact, the last time such an amendment came to a vote in Congress was 1983.) In an interview on NBC last week, for example, he said, ''In America, it's not going to be outlawed until a lot of people change their minds. And there's going to be abortions, one way or the other.''

  In a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in early September, a fourth of Mr. Bush's supporters said they thought it was likely that he would appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would keep abortion a legal right. An additional 30 percent said they did not know what kind of justices Mr. Bush would appoint.

  For example, Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Governor Bush, said the candidate ''does not support the use of federal taxpayers dollars for abortion or abortion counseling in the United States or internationally.'' Mr. Sullivan declined to elaborate, but abortion rights groups say they expect Mr. Bush to push for a ''gag rule'' on counseling about abortion in federally funded family planning clinics. President George Bush's administration pushed for such a rule. There has long been a ban on the use of federal money to perform most abortions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is also advocating a much greater emphasis on abstinence; he argues that education programs urging sexual abstinence until marriage should get ''at least'' as much financing as teenage contraception programs.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The newly approved abortion pill, RU-486, would also be treated very differently by a Bush administration.  The pill was banned in President Bush's administration, but was approved by the Food and Drug Administration this fall. Governor Bush said that he thought the approval was ''wrong,'' but that he did not believe a president could overturn it. Mr. Sullivan said, however, that Governor Bush would support the new restrictions on the drug now being pushed by Republicans in Congress, which would substantially reduce its availability.

  In a 45-minute speech, Mr. Gore mentioned Mr. Nader's name only once, when he said that the big oil companies want people to ''vote for George Bush or in any case vote for Ralph Nader,'' a name he hesitated to utter then slid over quickly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''For 24 years, I have never backed down or given up on the environment, and I never will in my whole life,'' Mr. Gore roared to the crowd, which roared back its approval.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It won't be a symbolic act!'' Mr. Gore yelled. ''I'll fight like hell for it. Governor Bush is opposed to it. Once again, he's got his own proposal that's fuzzy and phony and does not do anything.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000

 <textdata>
  ''I want you to tell anyone who is undecided, anyone who is leaning toward supporting another candidate'' -- here the crowd chuckled -- ''about the issues that we have discussed here this evening,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I want you to tell them the facts. I want you to disabuse them of some of the fuzzy logic and confusion that the other side has been trying to stoke. I want you to tell them that I'm perfectly aware that I may not always be the most exciting politician, but tell them that I will work hard for you every day and I will never let you down. I will never give up. I will always fight for you.''

  In a feat of political organizing, the Gore campaign took over the streets around the Capitol. Gargantuan Gore pennants hung from towering construction cranes, and the last-minute addition of the singer Melissa Etheridge as a warm-up act helped turn out masses of supporters as the sun slipped behind the Capitol. Nader backers were kept at bay and out of the television shots by putting them in a separate ''protest area.'' Lt. Bill Housley of the Madison Police Department estimated the crowd at ''upwards of 30,000'' and said it was larger than the crowd that gathered to see Bill Clinton in 1992, although that was earlier in October.

  Recent polls in Wisconsin have ranged wildly, with Mr. Gore ahead in some and Mr. Bush ahead in others. But in either case, Mr. Nader is clearly a significant factor here in ''Madtown,'' one of the most liberal college towns in the country.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000

 <textdata>
  Wisconsin is one of six usually Democratic states -- the other five are Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington -- where Mr. Nader could win enough of the popular vote to throw the electoral vote to Mr. Bush, perhaps allowing him to win the presidency. That is attracting strong campaign activity to Wisconsin, where Mr. Gore is returning on Monday and Mr. Bush is scheduled to appear on Saturday.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Nader supporters here have so far spurned pleas from Democrats to stop promoting him. Mr. Bush is winning in Wisconsin, they argue, and so the state is no longer in the swing category and Mr. Nader's candidacy will not hurt the vice president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Four years of Bush wouldn't be an unmitigated disaster,'' he added, explaining that he had no qualms about voting for Mr. Nader even if it cost Mr. Gore the election.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Like Mr. Jahnke, much of the crowd here was under 30, and Mr. Gore sprinkled his speech with the youth-speak that he often uses to show a certain hipness. ''Hull-oh?'' he said at one point. ''Give me a break!'' he pleaded at another. Describing a Bush position, he said: ''What is that all about?'' And in a new interactive play with his crowds, he asked those here ''what kind of math'' Mr. Bush based his proposals on. ''Fuzzy!'' came the reply.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was accompanied to the stage by his daughter Kristin and an actor, Bradley Whitford, who plays Josh, the deputy chief of staff, on the television series ''The West Wing.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He proclaimed Mr. Gore ''the single most-qualified'' person to run for president and Mr. Bush ''the single least-qualified.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr Whitford added: ''With all due respect, Mr. Bush, your record in Texas stinks,'' and he said this election had real consequences. ''This ain't no stinking TV show,'' he declared.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That is the way Mr. Gore feels most comfortable in making his appeal, Mr. Shrum said, adding, ''He's not here to make a political argument.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000

  ''The big polluters are supporting Governor Bush and they are wanting to be in control of the environmental policies. In his state of Texas -- I've talked about some of the statistics there -- they're No. 1 in something. They rank No. 1 out of all 50 in industrial pollution. They rank No. 1 as the smoggiest state. Houston just solidified its title as the smoggiest city. He put a lobbyist for the chemical manufacturers in charge of enforcing the environmental laws. Made some of the environmental laws voluntary. And then the state sank in its ratings.

  In the downtown streets of the biggest city in Oregon, it is remarkably easy to find people who say they are truly struggling with how to cast their vote this year. But it is remarkably difficult to find people in that group who see the decision as a choice between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush.
 </textdata>
</textdata>

  Democratic leaders here and around the country have mounted a ferocious appeal to convince such people that a vote for Mr. Nader is tantamount to a vote for Mr. Bush. But while this argument weighs heavily on many minds here, there are also many voters who will have none of it. Oregon is the closest thing to Nader country, after all, where polls suggest his support is higher than in any other state.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'd like to vote for Nader, I really would,'' explained Kevin McGrorty,  31, the proprietor of Bad Kitty Koffee, a sidewalk stand. ''I like what he stands for. I like the questions he's raising. But I've got to vote for Gore. I'd feel horribly guilty if I woke up the day after the election and Bush won, and if I felt that my particular vote had in any way could have swayed things toward him.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But no such conflict troubled one of Mr. McGrorty's customers, Danielle DeDee, a sales clerk at a local gallery and a fiercely pro-Nader voter. She knows her candidate is an extreme long shot on Nov. 7, though she said that was no reason to withhold a vote for him. And though she firmly believes that Governor Bush, of Texas, is ''dangerous,'' especially on environmental issues, that does not mean that she would rather see Mr. Gore become president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If Bush gets in, I feel that it might bring things to a head much more quickly,'' Ms. DeDee said. ''Pollution's going to increase in the short term, but I think that will bring a lot more people into the environmental movement a lot more quickly. Sometimes you've got to hit bottom before you come back up.''

  But with plenty of support in the suburbs and rural regions of the state, Mr. Bush stands a very good chance of winning this state and its seven electoral votes if Mr. Nader drains away critical votes from Mr. Gore in cities like Portland and the college town, Eugene.

  Polls this year in Oregon have shown Mr. Nader with support ranging from 5 percent all the way into double digits. An American Research Group poll of 600 likely Oregon voters, taken Oct. 20-24 and released today, showed Mr. Bush with 45 percent, Mr. Gore with 41 percent, and Mr. Nader with 10 percent. (Of self-identified Republicans, just 1 percent said they were for Mr. Nader; among Democrats, the figure was 12 percent.) The margin of sampling error for the entire group surveyed is plus or minus four percentage points.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The advertisements are aimed at voters in states with significant percentages of people who have indicated they support Mr. Nader. They focus on issues such as the environment or the prospects that Supreme Court nominees under a Bush presidency would be far more hostile to abortion rights than those who would be selected if Mr. Gore wins.
 </textdata>

  The argument that a vote for Mr. Nader could help put Mr. Bush in the White House seems to be backfiring.  ''It's manipulative,'' said Joe Reinhorn, a shipping clerk for a computer parts company. ''Some of my friends are arguing, 'Well, Bush is really bad, and Gore is somewhat bad, so it's important to vote for Gore.' Whatever happened to voting your conscience?''
 </textdata>

  ''He loves Nader, but he does not want to see George W. Bush in the White House,'' she explained.

 <textdata>
  Tim Hibbitts, an independent pollster in Portland, has calculated that among those who indicate a preference for Mr. Nader in the polls, about half are unlikely to change their minds, in part because they view both major parties as ''two peas in a very corrupt pod.'' The other half, he said, are more up in the air, and may well decided to weigh in on the Bush-Gore match-up if the race looks to be very close in their state, which it certainly does now.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If it wasn't so close, I'd go for Nader for sure, just to show my support for what he's talking about,'' he said. ''But if it's close, I want to be realistic. If there's really a chance of Bush getting elected, I guess I'd like to have a say about that. I don't want that to happen.''

  But with polls in so many states within the margin of sampling error, the Bush and Gore operations are pumping resources and campaign time into states that they never expected to be in play.
 </textdata>

     10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Most of the shifting is occurring on traditionally Democratic turf. The Bush campaign has sought to wrest away states like Wisconsin, Minnesota and West Virginia, all of which went Democratic in the last three national elections. Democrats are making inroads in Florida, a state Republicans never expected they would have to vigorously defend.

  The ever-changing electoral puzzle has forced both sides to upend their closing game plans. Mr. Bush, sensing he can win Wisconsin, flew to Milwaukee for a rally on Monday and is returning to the state on Saturday. Mr. Gore popped up this evening in Madison. And he added more stops in the state for Monday.
 </textdata>

  ''There's just so much territory, too many places to visit,'' said Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, a Democrat. ''I wish for Gore that there were 48 hours in the day and it was daylight every hour of the day -- and that he could survive on two minutes of sleep.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000

 <textdata>
  Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican, who stumped in his state today with Mr. Bush, put it this way: ''I can't imagine a race since 1960 where there were so many places in play. It's pretty remarkable. Maybe it's a sign that the strength of party affiliation in this day and age isn't as strong as it used to be, and appeals to independent-thinking folks on either side may be attractive.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000

 <textdata>
  Because so many states are toss-ups, polls show that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are far short of the magic 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Mr. Bush has a slight edge in the state-by-state count, but the map is quite fluid. Adding to the uncertainty and trepidation on both sides is that many polls are far from infallible.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This was demonstrated just this week, when a poll published on Monday found that Mr. Bush was nine percentage points ahead here in Wisconsin. Today, another survey was published that said Mr. Gore was seven points ahead.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The race is so tight in these states that officials in both campaigns said they were braced for the unlikely, but certainly possible, prospect that Mr. Gore could reach the White House by capturing the electoral college while Mr. Bush could prevail in the popular vote. The last time there was such an outcome was in 1888, when Benjamin Harrison defeated Grover Cleveland.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Under that sequence of events, Mr. Bush would be more likely to win the popular vote because in many big states like Texas he is poised to win with larger margins than Mr. Gore is in the states where he is ahead.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000

 <textdata>
  ''It's a very serious question,'' said Mark A. Siegel, a Democrat who is an authority on the Electoral College and a fellow at American University. ''You could have a situation where clearly Gore can have 300 Electoral College votes and Bush could have a million more popular votes and lose significantly in the Electoral College. It would be a legal election. But we don't know whether a president elected that way could legitimately govern.''

  The principal reason the candidates ventured into Illinois was to go to Chicago to raise money -- or appeal to women nationwide by appearing on the ''Oprah'' program. But in a season of ever-changing calculations, even that could change. The Bush campaign, sensing that Mr. Gore could be newly vulnerable in Illinois, announced today that it would begin running commercials there.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Beyond the close race, the altered map reflects other factors in the campaign. Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, threatens to drain votes from Mr. Gore in states like Wisconsin, Minnesota and Washington, and that has contributed to the competitiveness. In other states, local issues have been engaged. In West Virginia, for example, traditionally a Democratic state, Mr. Gore has troubles in coal country because of his reputation as a champion of the environment.
 </textdata>

  Traditionally, Republicans built their electoral base on a clear swath down the midsection of the country, from the Dakotas to Nebraska to Texas. The party also has long been potent in western states, including Idaho, Utah and Arizona, as well as in the South. Mr. Bush has enjoyed strong support in all those states.

  ''If you think of this as a football game, we're on their 30-yard line,'' said Matthew Dowd, a Bush strategist. ''They're not contesting any of the Republican base states.

  Questioning polls showing that Mr. Nader has cost Mr. Gore support in Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold said: ''The Nader candidacy is helping energize the race for Democrats and progressives in a way that's going to help Gore. It's going to lead to a better turnout.''

  One state that is even more traditionally Democratic is Minnesota. The governor, Jesse Ventura, an independent, said the Nader candidacy and lack of enthusiasm for either Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore would probably help the Texas governor.

  BOY SCOUTS TAKE ISSUE -- The campaign of Gov. George W. Bush stirred up unhappiness yesterday on an unusual front: The Boy Scouts of America want the campaign to excise a 3 1/2-second image of scouts raising a flag from a new commercial, which talks about education and never mentions the scouts directly. Gregg Shields, national spokesman for the scouts, said their lawyer had told Bush campaign that ''it would be inappropriate to imply any endorsement by the Boy Scouts of America.'' Mr. Shields said such use of scout pictures in political ads happened from time to time, but the spots were ordinarily altered after complaints. Mindy Tucker, speaking for the Bush campaign in Austin, said no complaint had been received.

  IACOCCA SPEAKS OUT FOR BUSH -- Lee A. Iacocca, the former Chrysler chairman who became a household name in the 1980's by appearing in car commercials, is now appearing in a Republican television campaign in Michigan, contending that Vice President Al Gore's views on the environment are a threat to jobs in the state's automotive industry. ''Al Gore may see the car as our enemy, but in Michigan, it's our jobs,'' Mr. Iacocca says in the 30-second television commercials, designed to help Gov. George W. Bush steal some of the heavily Democratic auto union vote. He accuses Mr. Gore of holding extreme views on vehicles, the internal combustion engine and the effect of exhaust emissions on global warming. Democratic leaders in the state are already firing back at Mr. Iacocca, saying that he was never a true friend of auto workers.

  ELECTION GUIDE IS FOUND LACKING -- Third-party candidates do not agree on many issues, but in Denver they agree on one: The Rocky Mountain News has treated them unfairly, they say. The newspaper's 24-page election guide published last Sunday all but ignored them. The only third-party candidates mentioned were those running for president. They received a line each, compared with full reports on Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. The Denver Post, a rival, published a 52-page election guide, including information on all candidates who provided some. On Wednesday, representatives from Colorado's third parties -- Libertarian, Reform, Green, Natural Law and Constitution -- took to the streets, protesting in front of the newspaper's downtown offices.

  FUN WITH STATE CAPITALS -- In the end, it was hard to tell whether he had taught her so well after all. Vice President Al Gore's 23-year-old daughter, Kristin, a comedy writer for the Fox TV program ''Futurama,'' has been introducing her father at rallies in the Pacific Northwest. In her lighthearted speeches, she has credited him with teaching her to list the Beatles' albums in chronological order and with grilling her on state capitals. At a rally in Portland, Ore., on Sunday night, she demonstrated his pedagogical skill by announcing that the capital of Oregon was Salem, while admitting that she used to ''fall into the Portland trap.'' But at a rally later in the week in Everett, Wash., it was hard to know whether she was joking, or had fallen into another trap of the Pacific Northwest. ''He also was the guy,'' she said of her father, ''who helped me study for my third-grade state capital quiz. Seattle. Got it down.'' The crowd hissed loud enough to be heard in Olympia, the real state capital. Gore aides later insisted the line was just one of her standard jokes.

  ED ASNER ON THE LINE -- Democrats have begun making tens of thousands of recorded phone calls featuring the actor Ed Asner assailing George W. Bush's Social Security plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The calls, begun over the weekend in several battleground states, echo the message being delivered this week in more than $10 million worth of television advertising. A direct-mail blitz is to follow. Like the television commercials and the letters about to be mailed, the phone calls suggest Mr. Bush cannot maintain benefits for retirees and at the same time allow younger workers to divert some of their tax money into private accounts.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  ''George W. Bush has a proposal that would undermine Social Security, even threatening current benefits,'' warns Mr. Asner, an advocate of liberal causes who is best known for playing Lou Grant on ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' He says that ''intelligent changes'' are needed in the Social Security program ''but not at the cost of current retirees.''

  The presidential campaign is not a game or a publicity machine. It is supposed to give us a choice between candidates. Whoever wins will profoundly affect the lives of every resident of the United States. If Mr. Nader's efforts give us George W. Bush as president, we will suffer profoundly in ways every Democrat is aware of.

  Ms. Ehrenreich inadvertently confirms the case against the supporters of Ralph Nader. She says ''it is not clear that the poor would fare very well under another four years of Democratic rule.'' It is true that the differences between George W. Bush's campaign and the Clinton-Gore record on welfare and the minimum wage are marginal. But by definition, the poorest in society are those for whom marginal differences count most -- something clearly not understood by Mr. Nader's relatively privileged supporters. Ms. Ehrenreich should realize that politics is about real choices, not ideal ones.

  With its strong Republican voting tradition and the near certainty that it will go for Mr. Bush, Kansas might as well be in the South Pacific as in the middle of the country, for all the attention paid to it.

  But the region is by no means unique. The Bush and Gore campaigns and the two major parties have surgically sliced up the advertising map to a rare level this year, spending well more than $100 million thus far to run commercials in only about 20 states in which the polls show the contest to be close. Kansas is not one of them. Indeed, even though the presidential contest is the closest in decades, nearly half of the nation's top 75 media markets have not broadcast a single presidential commercial. As a result, the nation has been divided into electronic haves and have-nots.

  It is still possible that a spurt of spending could occur at the end of the race. Mrs. Clinton's aides, while acknowledging that these groups have not been a significant factor so far, say that they fear a sudden attack by an existing or little-known one. They note that just before the Republican presidential primary in New York in March, a newly created group that supported Gov. George W. Bush of Texas paid for commercials attacking Mr. Bush's opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona.

  ''In my administration, we will ask not only what is legal but also what is right, not just what the lawyers allow but what the public deserves,'' Mr. Bush told more than 1,000 boisterous supporters at the Soldiers and Sailors Museum here in Pittsburgh.

  Mr. Bush was accompanied today by a native of western Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Ridge. And, to bolster his theme that he would deal better than Mr. Gore with military matters, he  brought along to the Soldiers and Sailors Museum three Medal of Honor winners and Gen. Colin L. Powell, who introduced him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He understands,'' General Powell said, ''that the first responsibility of a president is to serve as commander of chief of the armed forces of the United States.'' Echoing Republican criticism of the Clinton administration's military policies, the general added that Mr. Bush would make sure American troops sent to fight overseas would go with ''clear missions'' and ''be given everything they need to win, to win decisively.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush touched only briefly on military issues, focusing instead on ''responsibility,'' a word he used in some formulation at least 25 times in a speech of roughly 20 minutes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>

  The governor, who afterward met privately with the Roman Catholic bishop of Pittsburgh, Donald W. Wuerl, set the moral tone of his address early by talking longer than usual about his wife, Laura, who was at home in Austin. ''We've got a great, great relationship,'' Mr. Bush said. ''As a matter of fact, our marriage is even stronger than it was before, after this campaign. Yeah, it was strong to begin with.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Though he frequently criticizes Mr. Gore as a negative campaigner, Mr. Bush salted his speech with not-so-subtle digs at the vice president's  personality, which some critics describe as pedantic or overbearing.

  ''Lectures don't replace leadership,'' Mr. Bush said at one point.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''A good leader is predictable; he doesn't try to be all things to all people, or change personalities, say, for different debates,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I believe when it is all said and done, America will realize my opponent's campaign is a fitting close to the Clinton-Gore years. They are going out as they came in: their guide, the nightly polls; their goal, the morning headlines; their legacy, the fruitless search for a legacy.''

  Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore candidacy, derided Mr. Bush's speech as evidence that his campaign was ''getting very, very nervous'' about what she described as his declining poll numbers, although  in fact most national polls continue to show the race too close to call.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000

 <textdata>
  ''George Bush,'' Ms. Spell said, ''is trying to divert attention away from the fact that he lacks the experience and judgment to lead this nation.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also used the themes of trust and responsibility to try to draw stark contrasts between his policy proposals and Mr. Gore's. He would trust taxpayers to invest part of their Social Security taxes in private investment accounts, he said, while Mr. Gore would not. He would give parents the freedom to use federal education aid for private schools or tutoring, while Mr. Gore would not. He would give all workers tax cuts, while Mr. Gore would give tax relief only to the ''right'' people, as determined by bureaucrats.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I believe government works best when it relies on the good judgment and the common sense of the people themselves,'' Mr. Bush said. ''In a responsibility era, government must trust the people. And in return, in a responsibility era, people should be able to trust their government.''

  The impasse poses a particularly acute problem for Vice President Al Gore, who supported granting China permanent normal trading rights over vociferous objections from unions, environmentalists and other core political supporters. Signs that China is backtracking means that ensuring compliance with the trade accord could become a problem for the next administration, keeping alive an issue that Mr. Gore had hoped was behind him.

  George W. Bush, the Review figured, spoke at a grade level of 6.7, showing a fondness for the the word fuzzy, whereas Al Gore, who liked the word squander, spoke at the 7.9 grade level. Because Dick Cheney tossed around words like convene and decimated, he came in at the 8.5 grade level.

  I wish I could say that this fable oversimplifies this year's Social Security debate in some important way. But it really is that simple, and George W. Bush's proposal -- which calls for putting part of Social Security contributions into individual accounts, without any replacement for the diverted funds -- really is that irresponsible. Because Americans live more than two years, the drama will take longer to play out. Social Security won't go broke for about 30 years, so the victims will be those who are currently middle-aged, not those who are already retired. But the crisis will come much sooner, as the impending disaster becomes obvious.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush has made an important political discovery. Really big misstatements, it turns out, cannot be effectively challenged, because voters can't believe that a man who seems so likable would do that sort of thing. In last week's debate Mr. Bush again declared that he plans to spend a quarter of the surplus on popular new programs, even though his own budget shows that he plans to spend less than half that much. (''No fuzzy numbers!'' roared the crowd -- but these are his own numbers.) And he insists that he has a plan to save Social Security, when his actual proposal, as it stands, would bankrupt the system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But aren't there good economists, even experts on Social Security, who support Mr. Bush's proposal? Think of it as a Faustian bargain -- selling their souls not for power or wealth (maybe that too, but that's not my department) but for reform.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For there is a good case for Social Security reform -- if we are prepared to pay the price. The current system in effect promises today's workers that future generations will take care of them, just as they are taking care of today's retirees. As a Bush adviser, Martin Feldstein, has pointed out, this makes people feel richer than they really are, leading them to consume too much and save too little.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But to fix this problem would take a lot of money -- money to pay off the system's existing obligations. Or to put it differently (making the same point from a different angle): Since the problem with Social Security is that it makes people feel artificially rich, any real reform has to make them feel poorer. But that, of course, is not what Mr. Bush is selling.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But it's hard to see how. Try to imagine a victorious Mr. Bush explaining that he has to slash benefits after all, or abandoning his tax cut so that he has enough money to pay for Social Security reform.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What is certain is that Mr. Bush's actual Social Security proposal would bankrupt the system. That's not a fuzzy number -- it's a cold, hard fact.

 </textdata>

  10-11-2000

 </textdata>

  In a ''Clockwork Orange'' moment, desperately trying to condition Mr. Gore against another such unbearable performance, his aides even made him watch the ''Saturday Night Live'' parody of the debate, in which the actor playing the vice president hogs the microphone for a sob story without end, delivered in punctilious tones, and wants to deliver two closing statements.

  We should have realized what a martinet Mr. Gore was when his own daughter, Karenna, told this story in the Spike Jonze documentary that aired during the Democratic convention: Whenever the family watches a video, Mr. Gore insists on rewinding to the beginning if anyone gets up to grab a snack or run to the bathroom, and misses so much as the F.B.I. warning.

  The problem with Al Gore is not only that he's a goody-goody, but that he's a bullying goody-goody -- an oxymoron that seems a total turn-off to the male voters that Mr. Gore badly needs.

  If voters are feeling good about bad boys, rascals and scamps, Mr. Bush may benefit. Mr. Gore is locked into the Good Son role, while Mr. Bush is the Prodigal Son.

The Prodigal Son, on his circuitous quest, putting his sins behind him, surprising the father who had not expected much, can seem more appealing.

  Bush campaign officials said the advertisements were part of a ''troubling pattern'' of distortion by Vice President Al Gore. With respect to the environment, the officials said, Governor Bush has strengthened enforcement of the Clean Air Act and helped reduce industrial emissions by 11 percent since 1994.

  ACCURACY -- The commercial accurately reports that Houston last year surpassed Los Angeles as the city with the most federal ozone health standard violations in the country. It alludes to the fact that Mr. Bush worked with industry leaders -- and not environmental groups -- to draft an anti-pollution law last year that allowed companies long out of compliance with state standards to pursue licenses voluntarily under relaxed terms.

  SCORE CARD -- Conservationists say Mr. Bush left himself open to attack by showing little interest in environmental issues until he became a presidential candidate. Mr. Bush, a former oil executive, is hard-pressed to distance himself from some of the state's heaviest polluters, but his supporters insist he has used his ties to reduce certain toxic emissions in a state that is largely skeptical of environmental regulations.

  On the face of it, school vouchers are a polarizing issue this election year, with George W. Bush and free-market conservatives backing them and Al Gore and supporters of public education vehemently opposed. But voucher proposals don't have to lead to partisan deadlock. Limited, moderate voucher plans have shown they can build powerful and unusual alliances.

  The first two voucher plans to gain approval, in Milwaukee and Cleveland, were limited to low-income families and passed with the allied support of white Republicans and African-American Democrats concerned about education in poor neighborhoods. In 1999 in Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush campaigned with a pro-voucher message designed to attract black votes; eventually, the State Legislature passed a voucher program. It was a major selling point that vouchers would go only to students in the most beleaguered schools.

  The race is now in a statistical dead heat and The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press has found in a new voter survey that recent events, including the first presidential debate, have taken a toll on Mr. Gore when voters are asked about the candidates' likability and honesty.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At the same time, the Bush campaign has begun using the charges  about exaggerating and embellishing to try to discredit Mr. Gore's policy proposals and fend off new Democratic television ads that criticize the governor's record in Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign today, for example, charged that Mr. Gore ''continued to exaggerate his proposal'' for universal preschool. It said Mr. Gore fails to say his proposal would not apply to 3-year-olds.

  Mr. Bush has long sought to make character a major issue in this campaign and to link Mr. Gore to the flaws of President Clinton. But Mr. Gore shook off questions about his personality and Mr. Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, by pronouncing himself his ''own man.''

  But in the last few weeks and the first debate, Mr. Gore gave the Republicans new openings. At one point in the debate he tried to one-up Mr. Bush by saying he had visited Texas fire victims along with James Lee Witt, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He later said he had made a mistake and had traveled to Texas but not with Mr. Witt.
 </textdata>

  10-11-2000

 <textdata>
  ''The grass has always been very dry under Al Gore when it comes to his habit of embellishing and exaggerating,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. ''He himself lit the fire when he did it before 35 million Americans.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said he thought the focus on Mr. Gore's misstatements was overblown and would ''fade into the ether.'' But he also said Mr. Gore and his aides needed to ''create a situation where they can move on to something else.'' Another Democrat who did not want to be identified said that in a case like this. it was useful to ''muddy the waters'' by echoing the charges of the opposition.
 </textdata>

  The Gore campaign is trying simultaneously to nullify the Bush attacks on credibility and focus on issues that they think favor the Democrats. ''Our focus is on their distortions of major issues that actually impact people's lives,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000

 <textdata>
  Today the Gore campaign put forward Mr. Klain and Alicia Munnell, a former member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, to argue that Mr. Bush is being misleading on Social Security. They said he was not telling the public that most experts believe a plan like his to put some Social Security payroll taxes into individual investment accounts would have to be accompanied either by cuts in the guaranteed benefit or huge infusions of new money into the program.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore camp also said that Mr. Cheney had overlooked many of Mr. Bush's own proposed new tax credits for things like health insurance when he said in the vice-presidential debate ''they like tax credits -- we like tax reform and tax cuts.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And one line of attack was personal. Two days in a row, citing news and opinion pieces, the Gore campaign said Mr. Cheney was ''not being fully honest'' when he joked in the vice-presidential debate that government had nothing to do with his financial gains after leaving Washington.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore camp said Mr. Cheney's contacts from his years in government made him attractive to the Halliburton Company, and they said Halliburton had benefited from financial guarantees from federal  agencies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides and some Republican pollsters said that any Gore attack would not take hold because it does not play into the perceived vulnerabilities of th Republicans. Mr. Fleischer dismissed the charges, saying ''the worse they are doing in the polls the more they exaggerate and make things up.''
 </textdata>

  10-11-2000

  White Ayres, a Republican pollster, said the Gore campaign should have tried another tack. ''The accusation isn't going to fly,'' he said. ''They would have been better off counterattacking on anything which voters already suspect is true.''

  New York created a program called Child Health Plus, to insure children whose families made too much to qualify for Medicaid but could not afford private insurance, long before the federal government devised just such a plan in 1997. New York has also already taken steps to extend that program to the parents of many of these children, something else Mr. Gore proposes. And the state does something with its program that most states have avoided: it insures children of illegal immigrants with a special pool of nonfederal cash.

  The vice president seemed to get the message. In a round of network television interviews yesterday, Mr. Gore took the unusual step of acknowledging that he made factual errors in the debate and pledged to control his reactions to Gov. George W. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I've learned from the first one, I guarantee you,'' Mr. Gore said in one of the interviews, with the Fox News Channel. He added, lightheartedly, ''I think I'll sigh a little bit less in this debate.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000

  Only a week ago, advisers to Mr. Bush were showering their boss with tips about how to conduct himself against one of the most vaunted debaters in politics. They fretted about Mr. Bush's potential to foster a goofball image of himself, and his coaches let it be known that one meaningless but dangerous gaffe could cause his campaign to unravel.
 </textdata>

  Now, the tables have turned. As the nominees prepare for their encounter in Winston-Salem, N.C., it is Mr. Gore who faces the most scrutiny as he tries not to say or do anything that will cement an image that he puffs up stories and is not to be trusted.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although the polls remain largely as they have been for weeks --  with the race a statistical dead heat -- the numbers have tilted ever so slightly in Mr. Bush's favor since the Boston debate. And while Mr. Gore preferred the traditional style of the debate last week, with two lecterns, the format tonight is one that Mr. Bush fought for: the two candidates and the moderator sitting around a table.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's aides, gathered at a resort in Longboat Key, Fla., for debate rehearsals, acknowledged yesterday to feeling considerable frustration about the news coverage and the polls. They say Mr. Gore demonstrated himself to be superior to Mr. Bush on policy in that first debate. And they complained that the press set a higher standard for Mr. Gore's performance.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As a result, they said the news media seized upon and inflated the significance of the exasperation he showed at Mr. Bush's comments and Mr. Gore's acknowledged misstatement about the details of a disaster inspection trip to Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While a week ago Mr. Gore went out of his way to portray himself as relaxed and confident before the first debate, yesterday the Bush campaign assumed that role.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''No new makeup, no new clothes, no new nothing,'' said Mark McKinnon, Mr. Bush's top media adviser. ''We're dancing with who brung us.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That does not mean all is smooth for Mr. Bush: Because he performed better than many expected in last week's encounter, now the expectations are higher for the Texas governor. And Mr. Bush still has to worry about a nagging sense among many voters found in polls that he is not as swift as Mr. Gore and not as steeped in policy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some Republicans said they were nervous because the debate was likely to delve into raging foreign policy matters like Yugoslavia and the Middle East in which Mr. Bush is less agile than Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a mock debate at Mr. Bush's Texas ranch on Sunday, there was a particular emphasis on foreign policy. The advisers who attended the prep session included three of his top foreign policy advisers, Paul D. Wolfowitz, Robert B. Zoellick and Condoleezza Rice. On Monday night, Mr. Bush held a session in the governor's mansion in Austin on foreign policy alone.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gore aides said they hoped that just as Mr. Bush had benefited from low expectations last week, Mr. Gore's shortcomings in the first debate may lower the bar for him on the remaining two. They maintained that it would be easier for Mr. Gore to correct his problems, which primarily concern personality, than for Mr. Bush to demonstrate a presidential command of the issues.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I think it's easier to stop sighing than to understand domestic and foreign policy,'' said one Gore aide, who added that the vice president ''is relaxed and knows what he needs to fix.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's advisers said they were optimistic that the round-table format, though requested by the Bush campaign, would work to Mr. Gore's benefit by discouraging the candidates from attacking and thus keeping the focus more on issues. ''Format does affect demeanor,'' one aide said. ''It's much harder to rip someone's lungs out when you're that close to them.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The aides said Mr. Gore was well aware of his weaknesses. They emphasized that their understanding from the producers of the first debate was that there would be no cutaway camera shots of the candidate who was not speaking at the moment.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''That doesn't excuse the breathing, but that's what we were told,'' said one aide. Indeed, some Gore aides have humorously taken to greeting reporters and each other with exaggerated sighs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To reinforce the point, Mr. Gore's aides have shown him selected excerpts of his performance in the first debate. And they showed him a tape of the ''Saturday Night Live'' skit, which surgically mocked Mr. Bush as well as the vice president. In the parody, Mr. Bush, asked to sum up his campaign with a single word, blurts, ''Strategary.'' Mr. Gore's character repeatedly used the word ''lockbox.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He thought it was hilarious,'' one Gore aide said. But the aide said Mr. Gore also recognized that the skit demonstrated that the image of his exasperation had taken root in the popular culture.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides said the governor did not watch the skit but that his aides joked about it with him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Since neither side declared outright victory after the first debate, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore may feel pressure tonight to be more aggressive. In the third debate there will be even less opportunity to point to each other's weaknesses because the format will include questions from citizens. The risk of attacking, of course, is that the candidates could appear mean-spirited.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is really the last opportunity they will have face to face to draw sharp comparisons,'' said Alan Schroeder, a journalism professor at Northeastern University who is an authority on presidential debates. ''They could go either way.'' Noting that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush will be sitting close to each other, he added, ''They could go negative or they might find themselves intimidated by their proximity into backing off in the way the vice-presidential candidates found themselves doing.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's advisers, acknowledging that there were points in the first debate when the governor could have responded more cogently to Mr. Gore's criticism of his proposals, said the governor was sharpening his rebuttals.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They made clear that Mr. Bush was not about to shrink from taking on Mr. Gore, if need be.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The governor will set the record straight,'' said Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist. ''But he'll handle it in an appropriate way.'' He added, ''the Gore campaign is clearly panicking here.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Gore needs to come from his heart and not his head, and stay away from stretching the truth even one inch,'' he said. ''Bush has got to dig down and search his soul to focus on what he truly believes in about issues he doesn't have experience with. He can't only talk about education.''

  The effect of the first presidential debate between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore is unclear. While the polls indicate that a plurality of voters said Mr. Gore won the debate, which was held on Oct. 3, that does not appear to have translated into any appreciable new support for Mr. Gore.

  The Pew Research Center began its poll on Oct. 4, the day between the presidential and vice presidential debates, and ended it on Sunday. In that poll of 722 likely voters, Mr. Bush had the support of 45 percent of the voters, Mr. Gore 44 percent, Mr. Nader 5 percent and Mr. Buchanan less than 1 percent. The poll was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates, which also conducted a poll for Newsweek.

  The Newsweek poll was also begun between the debates but ended before the weekend. The poll of 636 likely voters, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Mr. Bush at 43 percent, Mr. Gore at 44 percent, Mr. Nader at 6 percent and Mr. Buchanan at 1 percent.

  George Bush has the distinction of ordering the largest presidential limousine ever made. ''Bush wanted to be seen in the biggest car imaginable,'' Mr. Brinkley said.

  Despite a famous drunken incident in Washington in 1973, when he drove along the street late at night dragging a clanking garbage can, Mr. Bush is known as a sturdy, cautious driver with a penchant for nondescript cars.

  ''When he drove down to Midland, Tex., he was driving a 1970 Cutlass, which was really worn out,'' said Elizabeth Mitchell, who wrote ''W: Revenge of the Bush Dynasty.'' ''His friends used to make fun of him for it. There's actually no indication that he was a wild driver. He is a guy who was extremely spontaneous and wild in many ways, but driving was not one of the examples.''

  Mr. Gore, whose perceived stolidity and goody-goody nature plagued his presidential quest before he started to loosen up, is actually the wilder of the two drivers. ''In his early days in Congress, he had kind of a lead foot,'' said Bill Turque, a Newsweek columnist and author of ''Inventing Al Gore: A Biography.'' ''Tom Luken, the Ohio congressman, told me that they were at this event at the Four Seasons in Georgetown. They got word that they had 15 minutes to get back to the House for a vote. Well, Luken says, 'We have no chance to do this, there's rush-hour traffic.' Gore says, 'Watch me,' and jumps into the car, invoking the tradition that allows members of Congress to break traffic rules if it's on a vote.''

  But the new T-Bird may already be making its mark. Over the summer, The New York Observer commissioned the satiric artist Drew Friedman to caricature Vice President Al Gore and United States Senator Joseph I. Lieberman at the Democratic National Convention. He showed them both wearing sunglasses and in a red Thunderbird with the top down, the giant Hollywood sign in the background.

  Gov. George W. Bush landed on his opponent's doorstep today, at least politically speaking, to portray Vice President Al Gore as someone who had spent so much time in Washington that he had lost touch with voters even in his home state.

  Bolstered by a recent poll that showed Mr. Bush with a slight but statistically insignificant advantage here, he made a barbed joke about the fact that Mr. Gore might not be able to count on a victory in Tennessee, which he represented for 16 years in Congress.

  ''He used to call this state home,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But it seems like it was so long in the distant past, he forgot to trust the people of Tennessee. He forgot what it's like to be out here with the hard-working people.''

  As he did last week, when he traveled to West Virginia on the day before the first debate, Mr. Bush was again drawing attention to a state where the vice president seems to be performing below expectations. It was a way to cast Mr. Gore as an unappealing contender, even though polls suggest that the two candidates are running neck and neck.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To further rib Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush alluded to a June news report about tenants of Mr. Gore's in Carthage, Tenn., who said that their frequent complaints about overflowing toilets and clogged sinks had been ignored. Mr. Gore subsequently promised to have the necessary repairs made.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000

  ''Tennessee is a fine place to live,'' Mr. Bush told the crowd today. ''I guess it, though, depends who your landlord is.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, also roasted Mr. Gore as she talked about the debate, clearly seeking to direct voters' attention to some of the foibles and quirks that he exhibited in the candidates' previous face-off.

  Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said that the coach had been with Mr. Gore since the primaries. He added that Mr. Bush ''should bring in a magician'' to help him sell his claim that his policies would benefit Americans more.

  At the Tennessee rally, Mr. Bush offered his first public response to the newly aggressive Democratic campaign to dissect and disparage his record in Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I understand that my opponent is fixing to go down to Texas, or somebody on his team is, and kind of try to tear down our state,'' Mr. Bush said in a genial, what-else-would-you-expect voice. ''Come on down! We welcome the talk about the Texas record, because it's a state where both Republicans and Democrats have worked together.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush returned again and again to the promise that he would be able to find common ground for Republicans and Democrats. His campaign released a long list of Democrats from around the country who were supporting Mr. Bush, and several of them -- including Griffin B. Bell, who served as the United States attorney general under President Jimmy Carter -- appeared with Mr. Bush today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush hammered hardest at his sustained assertion that Mr. Gore's proposals favored federal mandates over individual autonomy, which he said reflected the fact that Mr. Gore was ''of Washington, for Washington and by Washington.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By contrast, Mr. Bush said: ''We want to free the people of this great country. And that's why things are going well in Tennessee, because we stand on the side of the people of this great state, whether they be Republican or Democrat or open-minded independent.''

  So it is not surprising that though abortion rights have been constitutionally protected for a generation, the political and cultural battle over this issue rages undiminished 27 years after Roe v. Wade. As Vice President Al Gore said in his first debate with Gov. George W. Bush, the issue of abortion rights ''is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.'' It emerged as a point of difference in the vice-presidential debate and the one on Sunday between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio in the Senate race in New York, and is animating Congressional and state legislative races across the nation.

  The two presidential candidates have starkly different positions. Mr. Gore, who early in his political career opposed federal funding for abortion, now supports federal funding and is resolutely pro-choice. Mr. Bush is pro-life, though he seems eager to avoid extended debate on this matter so as not to alienate moderate voters. Mr. Gore says he will appoint justices who will respect women's reproductive rights. Mr. Bush, who says he will not impose a pro-life litmus test on a Supreme Court nominee, cites Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas as his models. Both justices believe the Roe decision was wrong and should be overturned.
 </textdata>

  The president's power in this arena is not limited to Supreme Court appointments. Veto threats by President Clinton have killed several measures in Congress to limit abortion rights, and his pro-choice stance has also helped to curb efforts to restrict access to contraception. Just last week a bill was introduced in the House to severely restrict the use of RU-486, the abortion pill recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. Gore has said he fully supports the F.D.A. decision on the drug. Mr. Bush, however, has questioned the F.D.A.'s review process. Although he has said he cannot overturn the approval, he might have to decide whether to sign or veto a bill to deny vast numbers of women access to the drug.

  The Republicans, and Gov. George W. Bush, have a 2 to 1 advantage in cash on hand over the Democrats and Vice President Al Gore. Party officials said today that the Republicans had about $50 million in the bank and the Democrats had $25 million. The money will go to issue advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts between now and the Nov. 7 election.

  For their part, Democratic Party officials, who in the past have criticized the $100 million raised by Governor Bush's campaign, said they had actually narrowed the wide financial gap enjoyed in past election years by the Republicans.

  Joseph Ewing, 34, a firefighter, usually votes for Republicans. But after watching Gov. George W.

''He was having trouble even in the debate when they were asking him the Yugoslavia question.''

  The uncertainty is not unique to Circleville, a working-class community that is roughly split between Republicans and Democrats and is known far and wide for its annual pumpkin festival and the gigantic pumpkin-shaped water tower that looms over the roughly 12,000 residents. Even among the voters nationwide who support Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore, 4 in 10 have reservations about their candidate, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. Four years ago, only 3 in 10 expressed reservations about the nominees.

  In their second debate, in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Wednesday, the contenders will seek to allay the voters' lingering doubts. But judging from the interviews in this town about 30 miles south of Columbus, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have a tough sell.

 <textdata>
  When asked about Mr. Gore, the first response of voter after voter -- even some supporters -- was that he has trouble telling the truth. Voters raised the matter themselves with no prompting. They seemed to be reacting to the instances in last week's debate, or the news coverage of it, in which Mr. Gore embellished events.

  Toni Lewis, 44, a bus driver, said she would probably vote for Mr. Gore because as vice president ''he's already in the spot where he can take over.'' But she was deeply troubled by how Mr. Gore presented himself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Lewis's friend John Peele, 46, a prison worker, piped in, saying Mr. Gore would be more acceptable than Mr. Bush, who he said was ''not capable of taking over the country.''

 <textdata>
  Fred Brown, 65, a retired minister who backed Ross Perot four years ago, said he was so put off by Mr. Gore that he would probably back Mr. Bush. ''He's got his dad to lean back on,'' Mr. Brown said. ''I can't stand the lying man. I embellish, but I can get away with it. I'm not running for president.''

  Unlike the sentiments expressed about the vice president, not one overriding concern about Mr. Bush  stood out with voters. Still, many expressed reservations about him, the most common being whether he had sufficient depth of knowledge or experience to be president.

  ''I'll probably vote for Gore because Bush won't raise the minimum wage,'' said Walt Seymour, a warehouse worker in his 40's. ''But Clinton has more backbone.

  Ned R. Young, 80, a retired electrical engineer, said he was backing Mr. Bush because he was tired of paying high taxes. ''I've watched my taxes go from $340 a year to $1,400 a year,'' Mr. Young said. ''Bush will do a better job on leadership. Bush said in the debate he would be better able to work with Democrats and Republicans in Congress. I never heard Gore make that statement.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Without prompting, Mr. Young mentioned how Mr. Bush often mangled words. ''I'm not worried about how people speak,'' he said. ''That's a picky, picky thing.''

  Down the street, Mary K. May, 84, a retired geography teacher, who has lived in a white brick house at Franklin and Washington Streets for 76 years, sounded more lukewarm about Mr. Bush. Both candidates, she complained, were obsessed with soliciting voters for donations.

  At today's event, held in a minor-league baseball stadium in this town west of Green Bay, Mr. Bush was accompanied by Governor Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and his vice-presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, who asserted that eight years of neglect by the Clinton administration had left the military dispirited, overextended, poorly equipped and unprepared.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000

 <textdata>
  ''I don't think any future secretary of defense is ever likely to call Al Gore and Bill Clinton and thank them for what they did to the U.S. military,'' he said.

  In his remarks, Mr. Bush accused Mr. Gore of using Halloween tactics to scare senior citizens about the Republican's plans for Social Security and Medicare.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has called for allowing taxpayers to invest part of their Social Security taxes in private accounts, and for using federal subsidies to encourage private insurers to provide Medicare coverage. Mr. Gore contends that Mr. Bush's proposals would lead to cuts in Social Security benefits and inadequate health care for the elderly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also asserted that Mr. Gore had not fulfilled campaign pledges in 1992 and 1996 to fortify Medicare.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He says you ain't seen nothing yet,'' Mr. Bush said, mimicking one of Mr. Gore's favorite lines. ''And we say, 'You bet, Mr. Vice President, we haven't seen anything yet when it comes to Medicare.' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On several occasions, Mr. Bush mentioned President Clinton, drawing lusty choruses of boos each time. ''Make no mistake, my opponent is a formidable candidate,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He's got the president getting ready to campaign for him.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And in what clearly seemed like a reference to Mr. Clinton's affair with a White House intern, Mr. Bush told the crowd, ''The best ally a family will have is a president who behaves responsibly in office.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000

  Mr. Gore has repeatedly accused Mr. Bush of representing the interests of the rich and powerful, and Mr. Bush has responded by injecting a dose of populism into his speeches, as was evident again today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The governor described himself as ''standing on the side of the working people.'' He ridiculed Mr. Gore for having lived in Washington too long and thereby losing touch with common people.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And he derided Mr. Gore for saying that he would give ''targeted'' tax cuts to ''the right people'' -- a phrase Mr. Bush said demonstrated an arrogance and elitism on the part of the vice president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''That's not our vision for America, folks,'' Mr. Bush said. ''See, we're one nation under God, indivisible. We're all the right people in America.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In recent weeks, Mr. Bush has stopped holding news conferences and rarely walks to the back of his campaign plane for informal, off-the-record chats with reporters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Earlier this week, Mr. Bush light-heartedly traded hand signals with reporters, first flashing a ''V'' for victory sign with two fingers, then adding a third digit to form a ''W.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Today, Mr. Bush tried the three-fingered wave on his Wisconsin crowd, eliciting chants of ''W.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But as the campaign comes down to its last nine days, Al Gore and George W. Bush have reverted to a fundamental argument about the role of the federal government in everyday life that had Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson spitting at each other, and fueled the critics of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Not surprisingly, each candidate is now trying to depict the other in stereotypical terms. The Bush campaign desperately wants to cast the vice president as a Democratic caricature: spending big, promising big, regulating big and using the tax code to interfere with your life. Meanwhile, Mr. Gore's operation wants Americans to dismiss the Texas governor as a captive of big business, who will sacrifice the middle class in the name of cutting the government.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some of this fits; much does not. Al Gore is the first Democrat in memory with the luxury or the record to run on a platform of wiping out the national debt in 12 years. George W. Bush is the first Republican to try to reach the Oval Office by talking seriously about federal education standards and new prescription drug benefits.  Each candidate, in short, is striving to transform the traditional image of his own party.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Just listen to the stump speeches last week. There was Mr. Bush in Arlington Heights, Ill., on Tuesday, his hand chopping the air, explaining how he would save Social Security and Medicare -- programs that, more than a half-century ago, Republican nominees for president decried as ''creeping socialism.'' (Meanwhile, he was also telling the undecided that Mr. Gore ''wants to increase the size and scope of the federal government more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined. That's pretty big.'')
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Then there is the second kind of big government, the one that taxes and regulates, and uses those powers to reshape the nation. This is the kind Mr. Bush complains about most frequently, and what he says is music to tens of millions of ears. But it is also a dangerous game, because the goal posts keep changing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  SO Mr. Gore has a problem. The populist, old Democrat side of his brain wants to rail about the evils of all those chemical companies and oil firms that have, to listen to his television ads, turned Houston into the American version of Bhopal. On the other hand, he is surrounded by advisers, from former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to his own running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who visibly wince when the vice president takes his corporate-bashing rhetoric too far.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore, in short, wants it both ways. He wants to show he can be an old Democrat and a new Democrat. He has no problem bashing a few special interests one day, then talking up permanent research and development tax credits for them the next. He wants to preserve his environmental base -- that was the old Mr. Gore waxing eloquent about the dangers of global warming on Thursday -- while still reassuring the country that he won't put the environment ahead of economic growth.

  Mr. Bush, meanwhile, wants credit both as a traditional Republican and a compassionate one. So he mocks Mr. Gore's targeted tax cuts for owners of energy-saving cars, saying that under his plan, almost everyone gets a lower tax bill.

  BUT Mr. Bush has targeted tax breaks of his own, including one to bail out farmers from the effects of low prices for their goods, another to expand education savings accounts, and another to encourage more charitable gifts.

  So both men have shifted away from the traditional images of their party and -- perhaps -- the expectations of how they would govern. Mr. Bush's Republicans, as he describes them, envision themselves playing a more activist role in society. And Mr. Gore's Democrats say they want to promote entrepreneurial freedom, even while regulating the market's excesses. It's easy to imagine Teddy Roosevelt ridiculing both.

  The week had begun with the poll showing Governor Bush trouncing Vice President Gore by 9 points, about the same margin Bill Clinton dispatched Bob Dole by four years ago. By 5 o'clock Monday afternoon, however, the Bush lead had slipped to a mere two points. On Tuesday and Wednesday, it was dead even, and then came that 7 points on Thursday. To cap off the week, on Friday Gallup had Mr. Bush soaring toward a 52 percent to 39 percent landslide.

  This roller coaster ride is not confined to Gallup, still the polling brand name most familiar to the public. During a relatively uneventful eight days, ending Sept. 22, a 14-point Bush landslide in the first of a series of Newsweek polls melted away to 2 points at the end. And the variations on many days among the multitude of different polls -- in point spread and even in who is leading -- have become a subject of as much derision as the deceptive claims of the candidates in this year's election season.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Like the candidates, the pollsters naturally hold themselves blameless. Seldom in their accounting for day-to-day and poll-to-poll disparities do you hear a word about the inherent fuzziness (to borrow a word from Governor Bush) of their own numbers. The fuzziness, they imply, is all in the heads of an insufficiently attentive and caring public, especially this year's reigning suspect as the source of all volatility: independent women. ''They bounce around,'' says Frank Newport, Gallup's executive editor, ''depending on the last thing they heard on the news.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  How can this be true and still yield the wildly swinging results we are seeing? Well, there are, of course, those flighty independent women. But, much more to the point, there is sampling error. Plus or minus 3 or 4 percentage points are the figures commonly posted for this error in an overall sample of ''likely voters.''  What the public is seldom being told in this election season is that the potential range of error applies separately to the numbers for both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is in the tonier, ''in-depth'' analytical reporting in the press, even more than in the down-to-earth horse-race stories about the campaign, that you get the greatest exposure to sampling error. Take the incessant breakouts on the voting intentions of men and women. Here the size of each group is half of the full sample, and the sampling error on the Bush-Gore spread grows from, say, 8 percent to 11 or 12 percent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Out of that, and perhaps some other things as well, you get such howlers as the discrepancy at the close of the Democratic convention between Gallup's figures and those of Newsweek's Princeton Survey Research. In polls a day apart, Newsweek had Mr. Gore ahead of Mr. Bush among likely male voters, while Gallup had Mr. Bush ahead by 19 points. Or consider a recent USA Today story that attributed a sudden overall shift in its Gallup tracking poll to ''independent voters, mainly women.'' The sampling error on the Bush-Gore margin in that poll's sub-sample of independent women would be in the neighborhood of 16 points.

  Given that Bush 1 (self-made Midland bidnessman, Yale grad and sports enthusiast with a bookish, plain-spoken wife whose project is literacy) was fired by voters when the economy foundered, and given that the Bush name was anathema in the G.O.P. for years, it is surreal that we may be only moments away from Bush 2 (self-made Midland bidnessman, Yale grad and sports enthusiast with a bookish, plain-spoken wife whose project is literacy).

  Now comes another antsy President Bush who reads sporadically and prefers reports to be delivered orally. It just proves the staying power of the Establishment. The insiders simply call themselves outsiders and say they disdain Washington and big government, and then gullible voters send the inside-outsiders right back here to make government bigger, their resumes longer and their private-sector contacts wider for future ''self-made'' cashing-in.

As one of President W.'s favorite justices, and as someone touted by conservatives as a potential chief justice in a Bush regime, he will come into his own. Perhaps the Anita Hill episode won't be the thing Justice Thomas is remembered for; perhaps overturning Roe v. Wade will.

  THE newly altered landscape is precisely what makes Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush's recent promise to pull American soldiers out of Balkan peacekeeping duties so wrongheaded, says Ivo Daalder, a Balkans expert and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''Kosovo was an American-led war with an American-dominated outcome, so to pull out now, when the Albanians feel under the most pressure since the end of the war, is likely to increase the overall risk to all troops there,'' he said. ''It would be viewed by the Europeans and the Albanians as a betrayal.''

  That Minnesota is considered a tossup is evidence of the roiled nature of this campaign -- this is one of several states where Mr. Nader's candidacy is hurting Mr. Gore -- and the vice president seemed almost exasperated at having to make the case here. When his descriptions of Mr. Bush's proposals drew boos, he said: ''O.K., that is a logical and rational reaction. But, hey, you've got to spread the word.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. Gore did not mention Mr. Nader, the Green Party candidate, by name, but Mr. Wellstone did, in an impassioned speech that left him hoarse and red-faced. ''It would be a horrible, horrible irony if a vote for Ralph Nader meant that George W. Bush became president of the United States,'' he said. ''It is too dear a price to pay for our country.''

  Earlier, Mr. Gore sidestepped a fierce struggle between gun-control advocates and the National Rifle Association, saying he would neither promote nor oppose the trend by several of the nation's cities toward suing firearms manufacturers for health costs related to gun violence.

  Last year, Gov. George W. Bush, Mr. Gore's Republican opponent, signed legislation that prohibits Texas municipalities from suing gun makers without approval of the State Legislature. Enacting such bills in all 50 states is a priority of the gun industry and the rifle association. Mr. Bush has suggested he would sign similar federal legislation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You can get a feel for my position by looking at what I've done in office,'' Mr. Bush told reporters in May, ''and what I did in office was sign a bill that made it very difficult for local municipalities to sue manufacturers of a legal product.''

  Mr. Gore's comments, in an interview with WPVI, the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia, are in line with a general toning down of his previously aggressive antigun stance.

  Last summer, Mr. Gore joined President Clinton and other Democrats who attacked House Republicans over the failure of a gun-control measure, and Mr. Bush for signing the Texas bill. And shortly after declaring his candidacy in June 1999, Mr. Gore began warning audiences that Governor Bush would sign a bill that would ''protect gun manufacturers'' and that he himself would not.

  ''This week, Governor Bush's allies on Capitol Hill passed a brand-new health care bill,'' Mr. Gore said in a low-key address to a couple hundred people in a room at Wilkes University. ''But instead of H.M.O. reform, it's an H.M.O. boondoggle. This so-called reform bill that they pushed through gives H.M.O.'s $34 billion more in taxpayer money, but it doesn't have a dime's worth of patient protections. And it lets the H.M.O.'s drop seniors and leave them without coverage.''

  The matter of gun control is particularly touchy in Pennsylvania, another state that remains too close to call. Two important groups of voters in the state -- moderate women in the Philadelphia suburbs who favor gun control, and conservative, blue-collar white men in the western and rural parts of the state who oppose it -- have essentially neutralized the subject for both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush.

  Mr. Bush has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association, which gave his campaign nearly $1 million in September and has spent millions of dollars pounding Mr. Gore in television and radio commercials and direct mail. The message, that Mr. Gore poses a dire threat to the rights of gun owners, has been aimed at states like Pennsylvania, which has the largest membership in the gun lobby after Texas, and other big states like Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin, where the election is too close to call.

  The New York Times said in an editorial that Mr. Gore was best equipped for the White House ''by virtue of his knowledge of government, his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision-making, and his commitment to the general welfare.'' It said Mr. Gore was the preferred candidate on leadership, taxes and the economy, foreign policy, civil liberties, environmental protection and Supreme Court appointments.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, The Times said, was ''not without his strong points'' and Mr. Gore ''has his weaknesses.'' But it added, ''the vice president has struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the Clinton administration's ethical lapses, and we believe that he would never follow Bill Clinton's example of reckless conduct that cheapens the presidency.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Taking a sharply different view, The Orlando Sentinel endorsed Mr. Bush. ''Coarse behavior, infantile squabbling and naked greed at the top have undermined people's trust in their government,'' it said. ''That must change. The nation needs a leader who can bring people together, who can stand firm on principle but knows the art of compromise. America needs a president who is willing to serve as a role model for all its citizens. The Orlando Sentinel trusts Gov. George W. Bush to take on those weighty responsibilities.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000

  The Providence Journal endorsed Mr. Bush as more likely to strengthen national security and broaden prosperity. Governor Bush, it said, ''seems determined to rebuild America's defenses and reassert its power for peace.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Journal said Mr. Gore ''seems prepared to squander much of the current budget surplus on a new generation of federal programs, mandates and bureaucracies'' and asserted that he had ''jumped considerably leftward, running as the champion of bureaucracy, teachers' unions, tort lawyers and other assorted special interests.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Denver Post said that Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore ''may be equally matched in both strengths and defects'' in appealing to average voters or possessing the better character for the presidency. ''The election, then, should be decided on the issues,'' it said. ''And on the issues, Gore has made the better case.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Denver's other major daily, The Rocky Mountain News, endorsed Mr. Bush, saying that he has ''a practical, principled view that the federal government's role in American life should be restrained.'' The News said Mr. Bush intended to aid the poor, guarantee the future of Social Security and, by cutting taxes, ''further liberate the American people and make the government less like a shadow that follows everyone everywhere.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Philadelphia Inquirer endorsed Mr. Gore ''because his vast experience and earnest intelligence outstrip what Gov. George W. Bush has to offer.'' It said that Mr. Bush's resume was ''remarkably thin for a man at the threshold of the Oval Office,'' and added: ''His likable manner should not lead voters to gloss over the shaky grasp of policy and the petulance about criticism -- indeed, the general lack of depth -- that he has shown in the campaign.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Chicago Sun-Times said that Mr. Bush, its choice, had ''sounded a conciliatory tone'' in his campaign, ''avoiding the ugly culture wars of recent years and promising to work across party lines for unity.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Chicago Tribune, also endorsing Mr. Bush, said he would be ''far less patient with schools that persistently fail'' and would ''recognize that innovation is nurtured and achieved from the local level up, not dictated from Washington.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>

  It said that Mr. Gore would ''expand a failing Medicare system,'' while Mr. Bush ''would venture an overhaul.'' It also praised Mr. Bush for having ''not given the impression that he has the last word on every problem.''

  ''They may not have used the exact phrase, but both Wallace and Thurmond would certainly have referred to the two major parties as Republicrats, '' said Mr. Karabell, using the term Mr. Nader has repeatedly voiced in this campaign to persuade voters that there is little difference between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas (whom he has also  called ''Gush and Bore''). And Mr. Nader's construction that the major-party candidates are ''Tweedledum and Tweedledee'' is also not new in American politics.
 </textdata>

  Many Democrats, of course, are furious with Mr. Nader, and Vice President Gore went so far as to depict him as a pawn, unwitting or not, of big business. In doing so, Mr. Gore was trying to cloak himself in the purer-than-thou mantle that has often been worn by the third-party candidates.

  ''If the big oil companies and chemical manufacturers and the other big polluters were able to communicate a message to this state, they would say vote for George Bush or, in any case, vote for Ralph Nader,'' Mr. Gore told a crowd in Wisconsin last week.

  For what struck me about the dubious premise behind the AT&amp;T breakup is that a similar premise underlies many proposals for privatizing Social Security. George W.

Instead, he trusts the people: voters are not supposed to notice that the same pool of money is promised to two different groups of recipients.

  Mr. Bush's candidacy began like a rumor, evanescent and insubstantial but growing on thousands of tongues. Partly on its own, and partly orchestrated by Mr. Bush's political strategist, Karl Rove, the bandwagon began to move: governors dropped by to pay their respects, speaking invitations poured in, policy experts and Republican gurus came by to bless the noncandidacy, and abruptly he found himself under much greater scrutiny than ever before.

  When a right-wing friend reproached Mr. Bush for supposedly having said ''God damn,'' Mr. Bush erupted in a string of expletives. As the friend remembers it, Mr. Bush finally cooled down and gave examples of the obscenities and vulgarities he uses, but added fiercely that he does not take God's name in vain.

  In his first term of office, Mr. Bush deferred discussion of a presidential run, focusing first on his re-election bid in 1998.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''His basic point was, 'go ahead, we'll do reasonable things to keep open the possibility' '' of a presidential bid, Mr. Rove recalled. As a result, Mr. Bush did some travel out of the state, worked on fund-raising, and undertook a series of tutorials to learn more about federal and foreign policy. But Mr. Rove added, ''I wasn't confident at all that he would make the decision to run. I know him too well.''

  In the end, Mr. Bush walloped his opponent in 1998, winning 69 percent of the vote and becoming the first Texas governor elected to a second, consecutive four-year term. Once re-elected, Mr. Bush turned to the question of the presidency and began grappling with what friends say were his two main concerns: his family and his past.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Once in 1994, when Mr. Bush was running for governor, he went to pick up his daughters from a party. But they had forbidden him to go inside, and so, as he recalled it, he obediently waited in his car for a half-hour until they emerged on their own, even as other parents wandered in and out.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On another occasion, when he was already governor, Mr. Bush teased Jenna  about phone calls from a boyfriend, forgetting that a television crew was in the house filming the decoration of the governor's Christmas tree. The footage was broadcast,  and Jenna was mortified -- and furious.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  All this left his family wondering what a presidential bid would mean to their lives. In 1998, the Bushes invited their friends Bob and Jan Bullock to a Christmas Eve dinner, and Mr. Bullock turned to the two girls and said, ''Your dad needs to run for president, and you all got to support him in doing this.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Little Jenna Bush had tears in her eyes,'' Mrs. Bullock recalled. ''And the governor, too.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Friends say that Mr. Bush might have preferred to wait until 2004 before running for the presidency, to acquire more experience and give his daughters the chance to mature more. But he sometimes compared himself to a cork in a river, and he acknowledged that the currents were particularly auspicious for 2000 -- what with an open Republican field and a scandal-plagued Democratic administration -- and might not again give him the opportunity.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000

 <textdata>
  One insight into Mr. Bush's reasoning comes from a seven-page memo sent to him on Nov. 2, 1998, on the eve of his re-election as governor. It was already clear that he was going to win overwhelmingly.

  The memo acknowledges that ''the mud will come,'' but it adds that a remarkable alignment of factors made a run uniquely favorable in 2000. These included Mr. Bush being financially secure with the sale of the Texas Rangers baseball team; his high ranking in the polls; a sense among many Republicans that they needed a new leader; and a sympathy among some journalists toward conservative candidates after disenchantment with the Clinton presidency.

  Friends say that one of Mr. Bush's key reservations about a presidential bid was his past: he did not want reporters prying around in it.

  It is unclear just why Mr. Bush is so sensitive about his background. He has admitted having been ''irresponsible'' in a way that suggests he may have used illegal drugs, serious questions remain about how he got into the National Guard and whether he fulfilled his obligations, and chunks of his life remain rather mysterious. But plenty of journalists and Democratic investigators have been digging, and nothing particularly sensational has been proved.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Whatever his reason, Mr. Bush prefers to keep a veil over his past. He did not cooperate with his two principal biographers, Bill Minutaglio and Elizabeth Mitchell, even though both in the end wrote books that in many ways are quite sympathetic to him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He got it in his head that the Minutaglio book was going to be damaging,'' recalled a friend of Mr. Bush's who says he discussed it with him. ''All this stuff about drugs and women was out there and he thought it was going to be the focus.''

  Then along came a different opportunity. Mickey Herskowitz, a Houston Chronicle sports columnist and a longtime friend of the Bushes, called to propose a ghost-written autobiography of Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and his aides agreed, and Mr. Bush gave Mr. Herskowitz a series of interviews. But there were a series of collisions, according to a person involved in the project.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The first occurred when Mr. Herskowitz suggested that the book begin with Mr. Bush's sense of a family legacy. The campaign was horrified; the last thing it wanted was to remind voters that he was the scion of a political family.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The result was that in August, the campaign took over the book project from Mr. Herskowitz, and Ms. Hughes began to write the book herself. The deadline was exceptionally tight, and campaign aides say she wrote it based on Mr. Bush's speeches and her own knowledge of him. Ms. Hughes declined to comment on the book.
 </textdata>

  Just a single paragraph recounts how Mr. Bush's daughter Barbara lost her stuffed dog, Spikey, while visiting her grandparents. It adds that Vice President Bush spent the night roaming the residence looking for Spikey, even though it was the middle of his presidential campaign and he had a presidential debate the next day. The paragraph relates that Grandpa Bush persisted until he found Spikey, enabling little Barbara to sleep peacefully.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is a charming story. But it also seems to be riddled with about as many errors as a paragraph could contain. According to a 1990 account of the same incident by the governor's mother, Barbara Bush, Spikey was a cat rather than a dog, Vice President Bush gave up after a fruitless search, Spikey was not found until the next day, and the incident happened in 1987 rather than 1988. President and Mrs. Bush confirmed through a spokesman that they did not recall that Spikey's disappearance occurred on the eve of a debate.

  Much of the ''autobiography'' is so meager and bears so few of Mr. Bush's own fingerprints that to some reviewers it simply underscored his lack of depth. As the Amazon.com review said: ''George W. has been labeled a lightweight by some; 'A Charge to Keep' will do nothing to dispel that notion.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000

  Mr. Bush agreed to give two interviews for this series of biographical articles. And although he is normally charming, there were times when he bristled over questions about his past.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''I'm sure it's discouraging to you,'' Mr. Bush said later in the same interview, in April. ''But it's not my favorite deal to talk about myself. So I'm sitting here trying to figure out what the heck you're going to write. And generally it's not anything I like to read, so it's kind of an awkward moment for both of us.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush paused and added sourly: ''Not really.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000

 <textdata>
  While Mr. Bush may not always impress people with his depth, he does convey a certain solidity.

  A list of the 533 overnight guests in the governor's mansion during Mr. Bush's administration, obtained after requests through the Texas public information law, shows that the Bushes typically had 5 to 10 overnight guests a month. But overwhelmingly they were old family friends or relatives, like Laura Bush's Southern Methodist University sorority sisters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But many were people of modest means who clearly were treasured simply for their friendship. The most frequent visitors of all were people like Jenna Welch, Governor Bush's mother-in-law; Debbie Stapleton, Mr. Bush's cousin, and her husband, Craig Stapleton; Mike and Nancy Weiss, old friends from West Texas; Pam Nelson, a sorority sister of Laura Bush's and still one of her closest friends; and Joe and Jan O'Neill, old friends in Midland who introduced George and Laura Bush to each other.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush has been criticized for appointing buddies and financial supporters to important positions in Texas, and for going to bat on behalf of corporate tycoons who contributed to him. But while detractors argue that this is unseemly, it is not the stuff of conventional scandal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Moreover, Mr. Bush's speeches and correspondence -- obtained after requests under the Texas public information law -- suggested that Mr. Bush had core principles that went beyond political expediency. In speaking to Republican groups during the early primaries, for example, Mr. Bush routinely suggested that ''the hardest job in America'' was that of a single mother.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In early 1998, there was tremendous pressure on Mr. Bush to grant a reprieve to Karla Faye Tucker, a murderer who had later married a prison chaplain and become a born-again Christian. Mrs. Tucker appeared so remorseful and so pious that conservatives who usually supported the death penalty called loudly on Mr. Bush to grant a reprieve, warning that his presidential bid would suffer if he did not.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Among the correspondence obtained under the Texas law is a fax to the governor from Mr. Wead, the former aide who also wrote the memo urging Mr. Bush to run for the White House. Mr. Wead, who has been a link between Mr. Bush and evangelical Christians, began:
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A notation on the memo reports that Mr. Bush telephoned Mr. Wead after receiving it, but the content of the conversation is not disclosed. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush was getting similar pressure at closer quarters. A family friend says that Mr. Bush told him that two days before the scheduled execution, his daughter Jenna dropped her fork dramatically on her plate at dinner and announced that she was against the death penalty.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush did not bend. He refused to grant a reprieve, and Mrs. Tucker was executed by lethal injection.

 <textdata>
  What does Mr. Bush's biography add up to?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In almost six years as Texas governor, Mr. Bush is credited by most Democrats as well as Republicans with having been an effective leader who made good appointments. But these have been six smooth years when he has been able to ride a rising Republican tide and a strong economy; he has not been tested by crisis.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some of the nostrums on both sides do not seem to stand up to scrutiny. Mr. Bush is sometimes mocked as a dimwit, but this seems flatly wrong. On the contrary, those who have spent time with him, Democrats as well as Republicans, agree that he is smart -- even brilliant -- in those areas that are important to him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The fairer question about Mr. Bush is not whether he has the intelligence to be president but whether he has the intellectual curiosity. He seems exceptionally unreflective, impatient with the world of ideas, uninterested in some of the nation's key political debates. Characteristically, he does not believe in evolution -- he says the jury is still out -- but he does not actively disbelieve in it either; as a friend puts it, ''he doesn't really care about that kind of thing.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush comes across as someone with a personal rudder in life. His priority is his family, not his politics, and since entering public life he has avoided scandal and pandering.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet for all his personal rudder, Mr. Bush seems to have much less of a policy rudder. He has instincts -- a ''healthy distrust'' for government, as he puts it, and an inclination to support business -- but he does not really display a fully formed ideology. Partly for that reason, and partly because he steers away from controversy, he remains something of an enigma, a work in progress.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his speech to the Republican convention, Mr. Bush criticized the Clinton administration for failing to address any larger purpose or great goals. Yet his question about the present administration -- ''to what end?'' -- could also be asked of his own campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is sometimes compared to President Reagan, and there are strong parallels in their communication skills, in their detachment from details, in their optimism about America. Yet from the start it was evident that Mr. Reagan stood for something rock solid. It is much less clear just what Mr. Bush stands for.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some of Mr. Bush's friends are liberals who would normally vote Democratic but who are making an exception for him. They say they are confident that Mr. Bush's conservative positions reflect simply his Texas background and the need to get through the Republican primaries. If he were elected, they insist, Mr. Bush would appoint Supreme Court justices who would preserve the legal right to obtain an abortion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There is some evidence to support each  belief. In Texas, Mr. Bush has appointed moderates to the state supreme court, and they say he did not ask them about abortion. A friend remembers Mr. Bush ridiculing  campaigners against abortion in a conversation two years ago, and other family friends say that Laura Bush privately favors abortion rights.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the other hand, Mr. Bush has praised Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas as his models, and both support overturning the landmark Roe. v. Wade decision that led to legal abortion. Moreover, an adviser to Mr. Bush says that the governor has privately praised Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri as potentially a great Supreme Court justice. Mr. Ashcroft, a lawyer who is one of the Senate's most conservative Republicans, takes the position that ''the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's correspondence offers few clues to resolve these kinds of uncertainties about his policies. Fundamentally, this is because the letters tend to reveal not so much policies as a person -- a governor who focused on setting a tone rather than puzzling through the thicket of issues.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A striking proportion of the correspondence, for example, concerns exchanges of good wishes, suggested appointments and invitations to dinners or golf tournaments, and few of the letters evince any particular interest on Mr. Bush's part in policy. The letters -- indeed, Mr. Bush's entire life -- conjure an image of Mr. Bush's possible presidency as a gala celebration on a cruise ship, everyone convivial and happy and, indeed, no child left behind.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the larger uncertainty is simply in which direction this cruise ship of state would steer. Mr. Bush has always seemed focused more on bringing everyone together and raising their spirits than on navigating the ship itself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000

 <textdata>
  In September 1995, for example, Vice President Al Gore sent a ''Dear Governor'' letter to Mr. Bush, enclosing a report on reinventing government. Since Mr. Bush also embraced the idea of streamlining government, and since Mr. Gore was the likely Democratic nominee in the year 2000, one might have expected Mr. Bush to show at least a bit of interest.

  There is much information about the presidential candidates available to American voters, if they choose to use it. For instance, last week came news that Vice President Al Gore has a habit of chewing his fingernails to the quick. This was reported in an article in The New York Times about the vice president's health, which is quite good, except for some concern about his cholesterol level.

  The drive has both a partisan wing, run by the Gore campaign and the Democratic Party, and an ostensibly nonpartisan wing, run by the N.A.A.C.P. in conjunction with several other civil rights organizations. But both are clearly drawing on the tradition that about 90 percent of black voters usually support Democrats, and they hope to transfer Mr. Clinton's enormous support among African-Americans to Mr. Gore. With enough money and enthusiasm, experts say they may break some records this year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To help reach that goal, the N.A.A.C.P. is spending $9 million -- from a handful of large donations -- on an enormous effort, known as Operation Big Vote, to boost black turnout in a dozen swing states, buying advertising and conducting bus tours with prominent political and entertainment figures urging people to vote. The tours are for the most part hitting the states the Gore campaign needs to win. Rural areas are not being neglected either; the nonpartisan Black Leadership Forum is distributing handbills in hundreds of barbershops and salons in small black communities.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the campaign by the N.A.A.C.P. and related groups, which is not supposed to be partisan, has at times veered toward such strong criticism of the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, that it has drawn fire for its tone.

  One television commercial features Renee Mullins, the daughter of James Byrd, the man who was dragged to death in Jasper, Tex., in 1998. In the commercial, Ms. Mullins says that when Mr. Bush refused to support a hate crimes law after her father was killed, ''it was like my father was killed all over again.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  (Texas does have a hate crimes law, but Mr. Bush did not support a bill increasing the penalties for crimes based on race or sexual orientation.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, a black Republican, said the advertisement was out of bounds in suggesting an equivalency between Mr. Bush and Mr. Byrd's killers, and predicted it would backfire.
 </textdata>

  10-29-2000

  Another advertisement, which the organization placed in The Atlanta Daily World and other black newspapers, urges voters to call Mr. Bush to complain that he has not sufficiently supported the prohibition of racial profiling.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But many Republicans say the group's drive is the equivalent of soft-money advertising for Mr. Gore and the Democrats. The Republican National Committee is also beginning an unusual advertising campaign on black radio stations, urging listeners to consider the party's position on education and taxes, but the attempt is not considered likely to change the overwhelming preference of African-Americans for Democratic candidates.

  Georgia, where Mr. Bush has consistently been several points ahead in the polls, is not considered a battleground this year, and neither candidate is running television ads here. But the techniques used here and in other states in 1998 are being used in this election's most contested states. Late last week, Mr. Clinton began recording telephone messages that make points on behalf of Mr. Gore similar to the points he had made on behalf of Democrats candidate two years ago.

  ''The thing that really energizes black voters is the presence of a candidate who is seen as adversely affecting their interest,'' said Mr. Holmes, a Democrat who teaches political science at the historically black college. ''This year, we don't seem to have the same sort of demon or enemy on the ballot. Bush comes across superficially as a good guy, so many people aren't bothering to look closely at his record.''

  If only everybody wore campaign buttons. More buttons are on costumes in ''Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man' '' than on city streets these days, it seems. Jim McManus at the McManus Democratic Club said only a dozen of his 1,500 members wore buttons to club events. Activists, he calls them. He suspects few New Yorkers today even own one.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Alan and Robert Slater are content to run the only button-making factory in the Northeast. This week, they will churn out thousands of Gore and Bush buttons, including one with Mr. Gore kissing his wife, Tipper, because they think a few people still believe in the symbolic, if not persuasive, power of the campaign button. For now, it keeps them busy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet the collectibles market for buttons has never been bigger. People who would never wear a Gore or Bush button will spend hundreds of dollars for a Goldwater or Eleanor Roosevelt button. On Friday, 1,132  presidential campaign buttons were up for bid on eBay, including one that promoted an Al Gore-Dianne Feinstein ticket (for $1,000).

  The diner sits on the border of two adjacent but vastly different neighborhoods: Bushwick, in Brooklyn, and Ridgewood, an interborough area that lies partly in Brooklyn but mostly in Queens.

  But what is our response to this? We complain about the price. According to polls, the cost of medicine is one of the hottest issues in this election. Vice President Al Gore has warned of price gouging by ''powerful forces.'' In a move intended to lower drug costs at home, Congress has passed a bill that will let anyone reimport American prescription drugs sold more cheaply overseas. Both major candidates have pledged to do something to subsidize or pay for medicines under Medicare. Whoever wins the election, the federal government's bargaining power with major drug companies is almost certainly going to be ratcheted up, forcing prices -- and profits -- down.

  George W. Bush has a dismal record on the environment, health care and judicial rights. Al Gore has furthered big-business control in America, letting companies decide whether we eat genetically engineered food, letting big agribusiness destroy family farms, and supporting concentration in the financial, telecommunications, cable and health care industries. Mr. Gore's actual record on many environmental issues, in one industry after another, has been one of surrender.
 </textdata>

  10-29-2000

  My candidacy not only provides the sole competition on these issues, but  also prevents Mr. Gore from cornering votes on the environment simply by not being as bad as Mr. Bush.

  Last week, Vice President Al Gore's campaign acted as if it was conceding this state's 21 electoral votes to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. The campaign's own spending on television commercials here was cut from $500,000 to $400,000, and for the second week in a row, the Democratic National Committee spent nothing. Mr. Gore, who has not been in Ohio since Oct. 4, resisted pressure from his backers to return.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the signals were mixed. David Leland, the state Democratic chairman, whose rank-and-file organization is considered dangerously shaky by many local politicians, insisted that ''a citizens' army is in place'' to deliver the state for Mr. Gore. Tim Hagan, a former Cuyahoga County commissioner prominent in Democratic politics in Cleveland, said the Gore strategists were shifting their dollars to ''those states that they have a clean shot at winning, and I don't think Ohio is on the list.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After Ed Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said ''reports of the Gore campaign's demise in Ohio are greatly exaggerated,'' Chris Matthews of MSNBC quoted Todd Webster, a spokesman for Mr. Gore's national campaign, as saying, ''Bush is going to win Ohio'' -- the kind of thing that is just not said in big-time politics, even if it is true.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This week, to confuse things further, Democratic money poured back into the state. According to officials in both parties, the Democrats earmarked $895,000 for advertising here, compared with the Republicans' $803,000. Much of it went for tough, negative television commercials, with Mr. Gore accusing Mr. Bush of promising the same trillion dollars to both young and old people, and Mr. Bush asking why Mr. Gore says ''one thing, when the truth is another?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000

  On the other side, one of Mr. Bush's top managers had expressed confidence not too many days ago that ''Ohio is a Republican lock this year,'' and Mr. Bush had not been here for weeks, either. But suddenly he shifted gears, hurriedly scheduling an appearance in northwestern Ohio, a swing region. At an airport rally in Toledo on Thursday evening, which had some of the electricity of a rock concert, he ridiculed Mr. Gore's recent assertion that he was an enemy of big government, despite proposing costly new programs.

  Speaking in a state where fiscal discipline is considered a cardinal virtue, Mr. Bush said of his rival, ''I know the man is prone to exaggeration, but this takes the cake.''

 <textdata>
  In an interview, Gov. Bob Taft commented, ''The Bush people are taking no chances here. No Republican has ever been elected president without carrying Ohio, and they take that seriously. He may even come back for a final visit just before Election Day.''

  ''We can be competitive here, especially if Gore comes back into the state,'' said James Ruvolo, a former state Democratic chairman who is now a political consultant. ''I'm pushing that; they haven't told me yes and they haven't told me no. I'm convinced people here are taking a second look at Bush now. No question that they like him better than Gore, but they're asking, Is he smart enough for the job?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000

  ''George Bush needs Ohio a lot worse than Al Gore,'' Mr. Ruvolo said. ''If nothing else, we should spend enough money to make those other guys pay for this state.''

  A Columbus Dispatch poll published on Oct. 1 gave Mr. Bush a five-point lead, 48 percent to 43 percent, with 9 percent for other candidates or undecided. A Cleveland Plain Dealer poll published on Oct. 21 put Mr. Bush ahead by four points, 45 percent to 41 percent, with 14 percent for other candidates or undecided.  And a University of Cincinnati Ohio Poll, released today, gave Mr. Bush an eight-point margin, 50 percent to 42 percent.

  With few officeholders and little patronage at its disposal, the Gore campaign is relying heavily on organized labor, whose enthusiasm for the vice president appears spotty.  Government employees' unions,  teachers and the United Auto Workers seem solidly in his corner, but the Teamsters, as one senior union official remarked, ''aren't all that involved in this election.''

  Branding Mr. Gore ''a coward'' and defying Democratic efforts to convince the faithful that a vote for him is a vote for Mr. Bush, Mr. Nader drew lively crowds at Cleveland State University and the City Club. A student at Cleveland State held up a placard that said, ''A vote for Gore is a vote for Bush,'' echoing Mr. Nader's contention that the major-party candidates are indistinguishable.

  One Gore strategist, specifying that he was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the campaign, said he would ''like to see Bill Clinton at 71st and Cedar in Cleveland, walking the walk and talking the talk.''  Worried about African-American turnout, Mr. Ruvolo said that he had told the White House as long as two weeks ago that the president should spend part of the last weekend of the campaign in black churches. That, he said, ''would do more to energize our base than anything.''

  In the Plain Dealer poll, about a quarter of the voters said they were conflicted -- they approved of the policies of the Clinton administration but not of Mr. Clinton as a man.  About half of those said they planned to vote for Mr. Gore, and about 15 percent said they were undecided. If Mr. Clinton were to emerge as a major factor in the climactic days of the campaign, several politicians suggested, it might hurt Mr. Gore among those undecideds.

George W. Bush. They were so upset at being confronted with the evil of two lesser candidates, they said, that they refused to vote again for the lesser of two evils.

  ''This year the choice is between George W. Bush and a Democrat who is to the right of Bill Clinton,'' complained Ed Fallon, a Democratic state representative who introduced Mr. Nader. ''I don't begrudge my friends and constituents who plan to vote for Al Gore. I understand their fear of George W. Bush. But voting against somebody isn't enough anymore. If I had three hands maybe I could hold my nose, my gut and my mouth and vote for Al Gore. But in good conscience, I can't, I won't, and you shouldn't either.''

  I asked Gingrich if the shutdown had been the G.O.P.'s Waterloo, as conventional wisdom has it. ''I run this game film in my own head constantly,'' he said. ''If we had come in more reasonable, we would have been sucked into the city, we would have been negotiated into normalcy, like George Bush in 1990. You could see them gradually being absorbed into the Democrats, into 'This is reality; how can you fight reality?' ''But was the shutdown necessary? Gingrich conceded that it was a disastrous miscalculation; but it was a halfhearted concession. He added, ''It was really important to take a former minority party that did not have the habit of leading and get it really intense about taking on the president and forcing the budget and forcing him on welfare reform.'' Gingrich told me that when he related our conversation to John Kasich, head of the House Budget Committee and a key negotiator in 1995, Kasich said that he believed the president would never have signed a balanced-budget bill in 1997 if the Republicans hadn't already proved their willingness to jump off a cliff over the issue. In other words, it wasn't a mistake at all.

  Would a victory by George W. Bush consolidate the legacy of 1994? Bush p re was the embodiment of the anodyne country-club conservatism that Gingrich and his allies abhorred. But Gingrich insists that the son would be a worthy carrier of the ''opportunity society'' vision, and he reels off the elements of the conservative credo in George W.'s platform -- school vouchers, Social Security privatization, tax cuts, faith-based volunteerism. On the other hand, Bush avoids the use of the ideologically loaded word ''voucher,'' and his proposal for a deep tax cut has seemingly aroused no more enthusiasm than the one that the Republican right more or less forced on Bob Dole in the 1996 campaign. A Bush spokesman confirmed that Bush's campaign strategist Karl Rove has known Gingrich for many years, and ''occasionally visits with him'' to discuss matters of policy. But Bush himself never mentions Gingrich's name, and is practically running against his own party's Congressional leadership, as Clinton pretty much did in regard to the House Democrats in 1996.

  A STAR-STUDDED revival of Gore Vidal's 1960 stage comedy aobut a presidential convention opened at the Virginia Theater last month to some lovely reviews. The movie version of THE BEST MAN (1964), directed by Franklin Schaffner, has won its share of praise, too. Henry Fonda is the good guy, an intellectual liberal with integrity. Cliff Robertson is the bad guy, an ultraconservative Communist-hunting ''man of the people'' who will sink to any depth for votes and endorsements. One of these men is going to win the nomination. Mr. Vidal's screenplay is witty, literate and deadly, which is no surprise. But it is a little jolting to see how the game of politics was so completely a man's world 40 years ago. The actresses in the film (Margaret Leighton, Ann Sothern, Edie Adams) are fine, but their characters are memorable mostly for their hairstyles. A lot of French twists - Friday at 10 p.m. on TCM.

  After pulling copies of the past few months' magazines off my shelf, I noted that most of the pictures in What They Were Thinking were of typical Americans caught in their daily activities -- over all, an absorbing portrait of American life in 2000. Imagine my puzzlement, then, when on Oct. 8, we were treated to a 1997 shot of Bill Clinton and several of his advisers in the Map Room. And lo, there are Al and Tipper, engaging in their now familiar conjugal kiss. Was this to ensure that no one is unaware of Al's acclaimed uxoriousness? I hope to see a similarly touching portrait of the Bushes in the coming weeks.

  Despite all the complaints about the difficulty of falling in love with either Al Gore or George W. Bush, these two very different men have delivered a clean, well-argued campaign that offers a choice between two sharply contrasting visions of the future. Even though Vice President Gore is a centrist Democrat and Governor Bush has presented himself as the most moderate Republican nominee in a generation, they have sketched very different pictures of the role of government and how actively the president should help families secure adequate education, health care and retirement. This is also the first presidential campaign in recent history centered on an argument over how best to use real, bird-in-the-hand resources to address age-old domestic problems while also defining the United States' role in a world evermore dependent on it for farsighted international leadership.

  Having listened to their debate, we today firmly endorse Al Gore as the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his knowledge of government, his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision-making, and his devotion to the general welfare. We offer this endorsement knowing that Mr. Bush is not without his strong points and that Mr. Gore has his weaknesses. But the vice president has struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the Clinton administration's ethical lapses, and we believe that he would never follow Bill Clinton's example of reckless conduct that cheapens the presidency. Like Senator John McCain, Mr. Gore has been chastened by personal experience with sleazy fund-raising. He has promised to make campaign finance reform his first legislative priority, whereas Mr. Bush is unwilling to endorse the elimination of special-interest money from American politics.

  We commend Mr. Bush for running a largely positive, inclusive campaign. He has not reviled government like Ronald Reagan in 1980 or played on divisive social themes as his father did in 1988. But on women's rights, guns and law-enforcement issues, he has a harsh agenda, and the centerpiece of his domestic program is a lavish tax cut for the rich that would negate the next Congress's once-in-a-century opportunity to move the country toward universal health care and stabilization of Social Security and Medicare.

  Mr. Bush has asked to be judged by something more than his positions. He offers himself as an experienced leader who would end the culture of bickering in Washington and use wisdom and resoluteness in dealing with domestic social problems and international crises. But his resume is too thin for the nation to bet on his growing into the kind of leader he claims already to be. He does have great personal charm. But Mr. Bush's main professional experience was running a baseball team financed by friends and serving for six years as governor in a state where the chief executive has limited budgetary and operational powers. His three debates with Mr. Gore exposed an uneasiness with foreign policy that cannot be erased by his promise to have heavyweight advisers. John F. Kennedy, as a far more seasoned new president, struggled through the Cuban missile crisis while his senior advisers offered contradictory advice on how to confront a Soviet military threat on America's doorstep. The job description is for commander in chief, not advisee in chief.

  Preserving the nation's remarkable prosperity  must be considered the thematic spine of this election. Mr. Gore helped stiffen Mr. Clinton's resolve to maintain the budgetary discipline that erased the federal deficit, stimulated productivity and invigorated the financial markets. Now, Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, promise to maintain fiscal rigor while using the surplus on spending programs and tax breaks for the working families that profited least from the biggest boom in American history. More specifically, Mr. Gore would seize this opportunity to improve the environment and spend more money to hire teachers and build schools. We like his capitalism with a conscience more than the trickle-down sound of Mr. Bush's compassionate conservatism.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To be blunter, Mr. Bush's entire economic program is built on a stunning combination of social inequity and flawed economic theory. He would spend more than half the $2.2 trillion non-Social Security surplus on a tax cut at a time when the economy does not need that stimulus. Moreover, as Mr. Gore has said repeatedly and truthfully, over 40 percent of the money would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. Mr. Bush would expand some programs for schools, but he also embraces the Republicans' ideologically driven approach of using vouchers to transfer money from public to private schools. There is nothing compassionate or conservative about blowing the surplus on windfalls for the wealthy instead of investing it in fair tax relief and well-designed social programs.

  The nation's biggest domestic need remains universal access to health care. Neither candidate would move as fast as we would like. But Mr. Gore has outlined steps that would start us down the road to covering the 45 million uninsured Americans. He would expand Medicare, guarantee prescription drugs for seniors and provide more opportunity for the uninsured to obtain coverage. Mr. Bush favors a bipartisan approach on these issues, but his proposals have seemed reactive rather than driven by an inner passion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's commitment to Social Security is deeply rooted, too, and more responsible. His proposal to supplement the system with personal investment retirement accounts is superior to Mr. Bush's plan to privatize part of the system. The governor's scheme would siphon money out of Social Security at the very moment when both seniors and younger taxpayers want to see long-term fixes to ensure its solvency.

  Upon his arrival in Washington more than two decades ago, Mr. Gore set out to master the intricacies of arms control and foreign policy. He broke with his party to support the war against Iraq in 1991. He was an advocate of military force in the Balkans, and today he calls for a more muscular approach to using American forces to protect the country's security interests and prevent genocidal conflicts abroad.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  We have expressed concern here that Mr. Gore might sometimes be too eager to project power overseas. But it is also true that Mr. Bush's repeated objections to using troops for peacekeeping and nation-building do not add up to a mature national-security vision. Neither does his promise to rely on his running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick  Cheney, and his likely secretary of state, the retired general Colin Powell.

  Mr. Gore will have advisers, but he will not need a minder. He understands that in order to influence the allies an American president must lead from the front. He has already been eye to eye with the world's leaders. While Mr. Bush has a contracting definition of national security, Mr. Gore has been in the forefront of redefining it to include issues of health and environment and the containment of regional conflicts that can metastasize into threats to world peace.

  Mr. Gore has said that abortion rights are on the ballot in this election. So are other issues such as civil liberties, environmental protection and gun control. The next president may appoint up to five Supreme Court justices and thereby exercise a lasting impact on the daily lives of Americans. A court tilted by conservative Bush appointees could overturn Roe v. Wade and assert a doctrine of states' rights that would take environmental protection out of federal hands. Ralph Nader and his supporters are not simply being delusional when they say there is no real difference between these candidates. They are being dishonest, and dangerously so.

  Mr. Gore brings a lifelong record of protecting basic rights for women, minorities and gays, while  Mr. Bush has almost no record at all. The vice president has been the driving force in this administration's environmental successes, and he understands the need for federal regulation for environmental tasks like saving the Everglades and for American leadership to combat global warming. Mr. Bush is for an unrealistic regimen of negotiating with industry on air and water problems and for letting the oil companies loose in sensitive areas.

  Most citizens know that Mr. Gore wins any comparison with Mr. Bush on experience and knowledge. Yet many voters seem more comfortable with Mr. Bush's personality and are tempted to gamble on him. We do not dismiss this desire for someone who they feel does not talk down to them and would come to the White House free of any connection to Mr. Clinton's excesses. But it is important to remember that the nation's prosperity, its environmental progress and its guarantees of civil rights and reproductive freedom took years to build. They could be undone in a flash by a pliable and inexperienced president driven by a highly ideological Congress.

  Mr. Gore does have a tendency to be patronizing and to exaggerate. But he has a career of accomplishment that can stand on its own without exaggeration.

Voting for him is not a gamble on unknown potential.

  We support Albert Gore Jr. with the firm belief that he will go just as far in bringing ''honor and dignity'' back to the White House as Mr. Bush, and that he will bring an extra measure of talent and conviction as well.

  Did you believe that your message was subtle? Yes, you documented that Al Gore has kissed his wife in public on another occasion. It's not surprising what the photo archives will uncover. It's even less surprising that Bill Clinton took full advantage of this opportunity to skewer the Republican Party, to assert his ''close personal'' relationship with a foreign leader and to tout his economic agenda. Samuel Berger fell into line, too, by suggesting that the Gores will warm our nation with their devotion. For years the news media have informed us that Bill Clinton's marital infidelity (in the office, with an employee, while on the job) was unrelated to his performance as our president. Now you want us to believe that Al Gore's loving marriage (which I admire) will be an asset to his performance as president. You can't have it both ways.

  But the Democratic state legislators contend that Mr. Bush bears some of the responsibility.

  In the debate, Mr. Bush acknowledged that the Children's Health Insurance Program ''got a late start'' in Texas. The reason, he said, is that the State Legislature ''meets only four months out of every two years.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  But the legislators said Mr. Bush had resisted their efforts to make coverage available to children in families with incomes up to twice the poverty level (up to $28,300 for a family of three).
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bartlett confirmed that Mr. Bush had initially wanted to limit eligibility to families with incomes up to 1.5 times the poverty level. He said Mr. Bush was concerned about the cost and the ''spillover effects'' on other programs, particularly Medicaid.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush ultimately accepted the more generous eligibility criteria favored by the State Legislature, but Democratic legislators said he had helped delay coverage for needy Texas children.

  The high price of oil has dominated political discussion around the globe in recent months, with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreeing to increase crude oil production by 3 percent, or 800,000 barrels, in September in an effort to decrease prices, which reached more than $37 a barrel earlier this year. President Clinton released 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve a week and half later to further dampen the price of oil after Vice President Al Gore injected the issue into the presidential campaign.

  A review of Mr. Bush's daily schedules, correspondence and other documents, obtained after requests made under public-information laws in Texas, underscores that he has devoted himself remarkably little to policy details -- including whether to go ahead with executions -- and instead spent most of his time wooing legislators, the public and the news media.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet this may have made him more effective as governor, not less. Even many Democrats in Texas praise Mr. Bush, saying he has appointed unusually well-qualified people, avoided disabling scandals or controversies and succeeded in getting a popular agenda passed into law.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is impossible to know clearly what a Bush presidency would be like from his years as governor, in part because Mr. Bush has held office for just five years and has never been tested by a recession or other crisis. But his experience here in Austin can help form some tentative ideas about how he might operate as president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The 900-page stack of Mr. Bush's schedules and correspondence obtained from the governor's office portrays a governor who works short hours and spends little time studying specific issues or working on executive matters. The schedules show that Mr. Bush typically had his first office meeting about 9 a.m., took two hours of ''private time'' at lunch for a run, and then wrapped up his last meeting by about 5 p.m.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides acknowledge Mr. Bush's impatience with long meetings and briefing papers. But they praise this as a Reagan-style assertion of a chief executive's responsibility to dictate broad principles and then delegate minor matters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The detachment from policy details may arise in part because Texas law gives a governor very limited powers -- he cannot commute a death sentence, for example, but only delay its implementation for 30 days. And it may partly arise because Mr. Bush shows great trust in those to whom he delegates authority, such as the people he appoints to the board of pardons and paroles. He almost always follows the board's recommendations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Linda Edwards, said he might spend more than 15 minutes reviewing a death penalty case -- the meeting might go longer than scheduled, or he might make a follow-up call later -- and that the time schedule reflected Mr. Bush's confidence in his legal advisers. Ms. Edwards said the advisers might have spent hours reviewing a death penalty case before discussing it with the governor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The schedules examined were for 1997, because that was a year in which the Texas Legislature met (there is no legislative session in even years) and thus gave Mr. Bush the chance to be more involved in policy, and he had not yet begun traveling widely in pursuit of the presidency. These days, Mr. Bush is rarely in the governor's office.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The schedules do not, of course, tell the full story. Long chunks of time were left blank, and just because nothing was scheduled does not mean that Mr. Bush was playing solitaire on his computer (although he sometimes did). Aides say that during periods when his schedule was blank, Mr. Bush made phone calls, read and answered correspondence, talked to staff members, met visitors and dropped in on legislators.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  These visits with legislators -- which Mr. Bush made much more frequently than past governors had -- have generated enormous good will for him and helped increase his effectiveness in getting legislation passed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was George W. Bush, then the Republican candidate for governor, and he was making a secret visit to a legendary Democratic kingmaker, Bob Bullock. They had never met, and even their aides did not know of that first meeting.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It would have been natural for them to sit down together after the election, but it was extraordinary for Mr. Bush to reach out in this way in the middle of a campaign that many thought he would lose. Yet Mr. Bullock, a craggy, explosive man, a Rodin statue come to life, invited Mr. Bush into the kitchen and sat down at the table.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Jan Bullock, Mr. Bullock's widow (he died last year), recalled that Mr. Bush first walked to the counter and, without invitation, poured himself a mug of coffee. Then he sat down at the small table and made a plea for a truce instead of a political war.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That meeting, recounted by Mr. Bush's aides as well as by Mrs. Bullock, helped lay the groundwork for one of Mr. Bush's proudest achievements as governor -- the spirit of bipartisan cooperation that hugely multiplied his effectiveness. Many politicians and consultants say that so far, at least, Mr. Bush has not left any fundamentally new imprint or legacy in Texas, but that he did succeed in uniting Republicans and Democrats behind an agenda that took Texas several steps toward bolstering schools and creating a more pro-business environment.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One of Mr. Bush's campaign themes has been his boast, which many Texas Democrats say is justified, that as governor he worked particularly closely with Democrats. Thus a central question about Mr. Bush is simply how transferable his style would be to Washington.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As a result, the two parties were divided by rivalry and distrust in Texas, but not by their positions on the issues, as is true in most of the nation. Mrs. Bullock, for example, says there were no ideological differences between her husband and Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet while there are doubts about whether Mr. Bush could achieve a similarly harmonious relationship in Washington, this bipartisanship remains a real and unexpected achievement in Texas. No one would have anticipated his partnership with Mr. Bullock, and the two men's cooperation became a reason Mr. Bush could get things done and a source of his tremendous popularity.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000

 <textdata>
  His critics accuse him of being a terrible governor on the issues -- keeping poor children off the health insurance rolls, backing polluters as they destroy the air and water, doing little to improve the quasi-third world conditions in the communities known as ''colonias'' close to the Mexican border. But few critics try to argue that Mr. Bush has been ineffective or unpopular.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Professor Buchanan said Mr. Bush would be remembered as an incrementalist who had achieved modest progress on his own limited agenda -- more progress than his Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards -- but that he would leave a much smaller imprint on Texas than such predecessors as John B. Connally, who helped build the state's university system, or Mark White, who worked with Ross Perot to begin an overhaul of the state's education system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Back when Mr. Bush began his campaign for governor, just about everybody thought he was crazy. Ms. Richards was a national figure and media star with high popularity ratings. Even Mr. Bush's own mother, Barbara, urged him not to run against her.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet Mr. Bush was determined, and he ran a shrewd race while keeping his hot temper in check. Ms. Richards tried to aggravate Mr. Bush into self-destruction by needling him and belittling him as a dull-witted daddy's boy who had never accomplished anything on his own.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If Mr. Bush had detonated in front of a television camera, such an explosion would have been particularly costly because it might have been seen as confirmation of what many Texans suspected: that he was running against Ms. Richards partly for personal reasons, to seek revenge. Ms. Richards had made a famous speech to the Democratic National Convention in 1988, ridiculing Mr. Bush's father as ''born with a silver foot in his mouth.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet Mr. Bush, whose temperament in the past had resembled a string of firecrackers popping, simply grinned amicably when Ms. Richards goaded him over the course of the campaign as a ''shrub'' and a ''jerk.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His cousin Elsie Walker said she watched Mr. Bush and Ms. Richards debate on television, periodically cowering behind a bathroom door as she waited for Mr. Bush to blow up. But he had matured, and he came across as the cooler candidate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One of Mr. Bush's insights was that while Texans liked Ms. Richards, they did not much agree with her and regarded her as too liberal. And so he ran an exceptionally focused, tight campaign that hammered home his themes day after day: better schools, a tougher juvenile justice system, tighter restrictions on welfare and new limits on tort lawsuits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's greatest asset in life, with the possible exception of his name and connections, has been a winning personality, and he used it to great effect in the campaign. On the opening day of dove season, Sept. 1, Mr. Bush went out -- with 30-odd reporters in tow -- to shoot a dove. A bird flew up, he blasted away with his shotgun, he held up the bird proudly for the news photographers. Then the reporters pointed out that he had shot not a dove, but a protected songbird known as the killdeer.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush promptly confessed, paid a $130 fine and began a news conference that afternoon by saying: ''Thank goodness it wasn't deer season. I might have shot a cow.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The humor and discipline of the campaign worked: Mr. Bush defeated Ms. Richards with a healthy 54 percent of the vote.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  During the campaign, Mr. Bush had told a reporter of his belief that the path to heaven comes from acceptance of Jesus as one's personal savior. Mr. Bush later recalled: ''It was, of course, picked up and politicized -- you know, 'Bush to Jews: Go to Hell.' It was very ugly. It hurt my feelings.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It hurt me,'' Mr. Bush recalled saying. ''It hurt to think that you think I've condemned you to hell, because I would never do that. That's not my role in life.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush later explained that the Rev. Billy Graham had helped him reach this position. As he recalled in a 1998 interview, the issue arose when he was visiting his parents in the White House and the discussion turned to religion: he argued that only Christians had a place in heaven, while his mother disagreed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I said, 'Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New Testament says,' '' Mr. Bush recounted. ''And she said, 'Well, surely God will accept others.' And I said, 'Mom, here's what the New Testament says.' And she said, 'O.K.,' and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to the White House operator, 'Get me Billy Graham.'
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I said, 'Mother, what are you doing?' '' Mr. Bush said. ''Seriously. And about two minutes later, the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the phone with Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy says: 'From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is saying; the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The issue reflects Mr. Bush's penchant for holding to views whose implications some might find offensive, while doing all he can to avoid giving any offense. The logical conclusion of Mr. Bush's theology may be that non-Christians cannot enter heaven, but he consciously steps aside before reaching that conclusion and insists that it is not his role to be gatekeeper.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A similar pattern arises on gay issues. While campaigning in 1994, Mr. Bush opposed an effort to repeal an anti-sodomy law making homosexual acts a crime in Texas. The effort to repeal the bill failed very narrowly, and it remains on the books, apparently with Mr. Bush's support.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet Mr. Bush has avoided trumpeting his views about homosexuality.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Glen Maxey, a gay Democrat in the Texas House of Representatives, recalled an occasion when Governor Bush was visiting the House floor to support a bill that would have banned adoption by gay couples. ''We had a short talk on the House floor,'' Mr. Maxey said. ''He said, 'Glen, I value you as a friend, and what I say about gay people doesn't apply to you personally.' And I said: 'Governor, when you say you're against gay adoption, you're talking about me. And I take that very personally.' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''George Bush was totally comfortable with me,'' Mr. Maxey added. ''But it's all those other gay people out there. I think that mentality runs through him, whether it's race or sexual orientation. Up front, he's a great guy. But when you move to policy things, it's a great danger.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's Bush, and he's very friendly,'' recalled Mr. Naishtat, a liberal who is the chairman of the House committee that was then considering welfare legislation. Some Capitol police officers were nearby, and Mr. Naishtat jokingly called out to them for help, but they did not interfere. So the governor walked Mr. Naishtat down the steps, keeping him bent over and in the headlock.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This aggressive bonhomie is very much Mr. Bush's style, and it has been very effective in Texas. Mr. Naishtat, for example, admits that it was ''seductive'' to be mugged by the governor, although he quickly adds that this aggressive approach did not work: he did not allow the welfare bills out of committee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, what is striking in talking to Texas politicians, even Democrats, is how much they like Mr. Bush. He invites them to the governor's mansion, he drops by their offices, he praises them in the press, he puts them in friendly headlocks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Sadler worked very closely with Mr. Bush on changes in the education system, and when the new school law was signed in June 1995, Mr. Bush scheduled the ceremony in Mr. Sadler's hometown, Henderson, and then praised him for his work. It would be difficult to imagine such an event at the federal level, with a president traveling to the hometown of the other party's congressman to thank him for his work on a bill.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One result of this gesture is that Mr. Sadler describes himself as a friend of Mr. Bush and is not taking sides in the presidential race. That is remarkably common: many Texas Democrats are steering clear of Vice President Al Gore and remaining on the sidelines.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet the Texas Democrats are sometimes also a bit irritated that all the credit for bipartisanship goes to Mr. Bush. They emphasize that Mr. Bush's success was in large part a consequence of his extraordinary partnership with Mr. Bullock, who was the lieutenant governor and arguably held more power under the Texas system than Mr. Bush. The two men developed almost a father-son relationship, with Mr. Bullock doing much of Mr. Bush's heavy legislative lifting. And while it was Mr. Bush who reached out, Mr. Bullock responded with equal enthusiasm.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Likewise, Democrats say Mr. Bush's agenda was partly drawn from measures that were already bubbling up in the Legislature, which would have been passed even under a different governor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Was he significant?'' Mr. Sadler said, referring to Mr. Bush's role on the education bill. ''Absolutely. But were the ideas his? No, that's not the way it happened. There were a whole bunch of people, Democrats and Republicans alike, working to get it done, and he was a part of that team. He was no more significant than any member of my committee or of the Senate committee.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000

 <textdata>
  A Texas governor's main powers lie in making appointments and using the bully pulpit. On both counts, Mr. Bush gets high marks from many Democrats as well as Republicans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  State records show that Mr. Bush has appointed many fewer members of minority groups than Ms. Richards -- 80 percent of his appointees have been white, compared with 66 percent of Ms. Richards's and 55 percent of the Texas population as a whole. In addition, 63 percent of Mr. Bush's appointees have been men.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While Mr. Bush's appointments have been less diverse over all, his choices have mostly been well-respected moderates rather than hard-line ideologues (although a couple of appointees have aroused criticism because of their remarks about blacks and Hispanics). And Mr. Bush's judicial appointees say they were never asked about their positions on issues like abortion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In contrast to this traditionally political approach, Mr. Bush appointed an old friend from the business world, Clay Johnson, to head the appointment process. Many of his appointees are financial contributors or cronies, but many others are simply experts in their field who are not politically active, or even Democrats.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's one effort to leave a major legacy in Texas showed just the kind of vision that critics often said his father lacked in the White House. It was a far-reaching tax proposal that would have addressed weaknesses in public finance in Texas by reducing property taxes, raising the sales tax and levying a new tax on partnerships of professionals like doctors, lawyers and accountants.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was a bold move that reflected a measure of political courage: Mr. Bush, not surprisingly, was promptly denounced for trying to raise new taxes. The proposal failed ignominiously, for while there was widespread agreement that Texas' emphasis on property taxes was outdated, reflecting an era when most wealth came from the land, Mr. Bush could not build a consensus on how to replace the lost revenue.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush never mentions the proposal these days, perhaps because it failed, or perhaps because it could remind voters that he had once favored raising the sales tax. He said afterward that the failure demonstrated how hard it was to achieve dramatic change without a crisis to force it.

  ''Guess what?'' said George W. Bush, whose home state is already the champion of the Western world when it comes to executions. ''The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them? They're going to be put to death.''

  But if Vice President Al Gore is elected president and Mr. Lieberman vice president, he will resign from the Senate, and Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, will doubtless appoint a Republican to hold the Connecticut Senate seat until the 2002 election. And if Mr. Lieberman does not become vice president and remains in the Senate, then there will be a Republican vice president, Dick Cheney, to cast the tie-breaking vote if the Senate is evenly divided.

  And what of George W., whose tax plan, decentralization approach and retirement reforms I embrace? ''As a page that has generally been reluctant to endorse military intervention,'' says the editorial of the newspaper I revere (especially for inventing the Op-Ed page), ''we like Mr. Bush's cautious attitude.'' It likes his position that ''any foreign involvement must be based on a strict definition of vital national interest.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Those qualifiers -- ''strict'' and ''vital'' -- strike me as words used often to excuse or justify inaction. Bush's most impressive moment in the campaign came when he parted company from impatient Republicans in Congress who, using such severe-sounding weasel words, wanted to exit-strategize our troops out of the Balkans before our intervention helped the Serbian people free themselves.
 </textdata>

  It's undeniable, though, that Bush --  whose foreign experience is second-hand -- is using the language of caution. This is designed to persuade voters that his inexperience would not lead him to reckless action. Bush's rhetoric of restraint is supposed to insulate him from the charges of ''that damned cowboy,'' leveled first by Mark Hanna against Teddy Roosevelt and by others at Ronald Reagan.

  A review of Mr. Bush's daily schedules, correspondence and other documents underscores that as governor he has devoted himself remarkably little to policy details and instead spent most of his time wooing legislators, the public and the news media. Yet this may have made him more effective as governor, not less.

  Both presidential candidates also agree that Medicare needs an overhaul and appear headed toward roughly similar solutions, except for prescription drugs. However, Mr. Gore's proposals are more generous, and more costly, than Mr. Bush's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush proposes adding a drug benefit to Medicare, with large subsidies for low-income families and about a 25 percent subsidy for everyone else. He also proposes to cap each enrollee's annual out-of-pocket costs for all Medicare services, including drugs, at $6,000. He has embraced the broad outlines of the commission's original proposal and his advisers say privately that the Breaux-Frist-Clinton revision is consistent with his principles.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also proposes a drug benefit with large subsidies for low-income families and about a 50 percent subsidy for everyone else. He would limit out-of-pocket drug costs to $4,000 a year, but he has not proposed a cap on non-drug spending. He embraces Mr. Clinton's proposal for overall reform.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The chief area of disagreement -- and it is a major one -- is the mechanism for delivering drug coverage. Mr. Gore proposes that every enrollee be offered an identical drug benefit. Coverage would be administered by a single private benefits manager in each region. Republicans reject this idea because, they say, it turns health coverage over to a government-created monopoly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush would first establish an interim plan in which drug coverage would be left to the states for four years, with Washington contributing subsidies to encourage state action. After that, Medicare would involve the private sector in providing drug coverage. Mr. Bush would not create a uniform benefit, nor specify what premiums, co-payments or deductibles the elderly would pay. Every health plan serving Medicare would simply be required to offer drug coverage costing about $800 an enrollee. He would rely on competition to make sure the elderly were offered affordable options. But the Bush subsidies look small, raising fears that many enrollees would find no affordable coverage.

  Small wonder that by late Friday afternoon, as Mr. Bush's week on the campaign trail ended, he jittered across the tarmac in Pontiac, Mich., like a human pinball machine, juiced by electricity, lit from within, beaming and bopping.

  With little more than three weeks until Election Day, Mr. Bush and his aides are exuding a mood as helium-buoyant as at any other point in the 16 months of his campaign.

 <textdata>
  And there is some wisdom and potential benefit in that: many political scientists say that late-deciding voters often break in favor of the candidate who is perceived to be on the surest path to victory. But there is danger, too, in all of the Austin ebullience, because the Bush campaign has fallen prey to overconfidence in the past.

  In the days immediately before the Republican primary in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush went sledding, bowling and snowmobile riding, obviously unprepared for the landslide victory Senator John McCain of Arizona ended up posting. Just weeks later, the Bush campaign was surprised again when Mr. McCain beat the Texas governor in the Michigan primary.

  Indeed, the Bush campaign is in some ways beginning to pull out all the stops. This week, it is sending Mr. Bush's mother, Barbara Bush, out to campaign in the crucial swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania, and next week, it is putting 28 fellow Republican governors in four airplanes to spend several days crisscrossing the country for Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  But the adviser acknowledged that Mr. Bush has a tendency toward excessive optimism, citing as an example his selection in July of Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary and a longtime Bush family friend, as a running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many Republican officials still see that choice as an indication that Mr. Bush felt so serene atop the polls that he put emotional preference before political strategy. Mr. Cheney, after all, is from Wyoming, a solidly Republican state with only three electoral votes, and his conservative voting record in Congress would seem to have little appeal to moderate swing voters.
 </textdata>

  But several political analysts said that what Mr. Bush and his campaign may be doing now, with their constant trumpeting of recent polls that show Mr. Bush edging ahead of Mr. Gore, is trying to weave an aura of imminent triumph. It could make a difference.

  On Saturday, the Bush campaign produced a news release with the headline that Mr. Bush was ''leading Al Gore among the next generation of women voters,'' and Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, drew reporters' attention to this development in a conference call today.

 <textdata>
  Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, insisted on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' this morning that Mr. Bush was ''ready'' for the presidency, which happened to be the same locution Gov. John Engler of Michigan repeated several times at a Bush rally on Thursday night.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That same evening, aboard his campaign plane, Mr. Bush had an exchange with the press corps that revealed a keen awareness of the disparaging questions about the depth of his knowledge and a keen interest in putting that chatter to rest.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A reporter jokingly asked Mr. Bush if she could leave the plane through the less crowded front door, which Mr. Bush uses, instead of the back door, noting that the rear exit was ''separate'' but not ''equal.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Plessy v. Ferguson!'' Mr. Bush exclaimed, showing off his familiarity with the 1896 Supreme Court decision that instituted a separate-but-equal doctrine to permit racial segregation in public facilities. His grin was gargantuan.

  First, his note became a tidbit by Mr. Gore in a televised debate with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Oct. 3. Kailey thought it was cool that it made national television, and Mr. Ellis was proud he had called the problem -- part of a larger national issue -- to the vice president's attention.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Fueled by indignant reaction from the school's principal, Dan Kennedy, and other school officials who resented having their highly rated high school used on national television to make a point about education problems, Bush campaign workers said Mr. Gore's statement showed that he would embellish a truth for political gain.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It makes Mr. Ellis, who happens to be a Republican himself, shake his head. ''It was nonpolitical,'' said Mr. Ellis, a general manager at a Sarasota restaurant, of his decision to send the note to Mr. Gore while he was helping prepare lunch for the vice president during a campaign stop before the debate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I had an opportunity to get a message to Washington,'' Mr. Ellis said. If he had been catering Mr. Bush's lunch instead, he would have done the same, Mr. Ellis said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It was verb tense,'' Mr. Ellis said of Mr. Gore's mistake. '' 'She has to stand,' Gore said, instead of saying she had to stand. We've been asked if Gore stretched the truth. In my view, he used it to drive home a point, and it was a good point.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The national media, pundits and talk show hosts, Mr. Ellis said, seized on comments by Mr. Kennedy, whom he said he respects, and other school officials, who said Mr. Gore exaggerated the overcrowding problem.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The schools superintendent, Ms. Hamilton, also said politics played no role in her decision to strongly rebut the image of the school Mr. Gore put forth.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Everyone, Mr. Ellis said, seemed to miss the point. It was not that Mr. Gore made what he called a small mistake in recounting the problem, but that the problem exists.

  Beginning the final phase of the presidential campaign, Gov. George W.

  They then plan to split onto seven planes and crisscross the country for Mr. Bush, making 45 stops in 24 states. Altogether the states represent 316 electoral votes, and 22 of the states voted for President Clinton in 1996.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000

 <textdata>
  The effort, in many ways, brings the Bush campaign back to its origins. The initial groundswell for Mr. Bush's candidacy began with the recognition inside the Republican Party that its governors were winning elections even as the Congressional branch of the party was falling into disfavor and losing seats. And from the moment Mr. Bush won re-election in 1998, he drew on his fellow governors as a mainstay of his candidacy and as his base of support in the Republican primaries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said the governors would lend emphasis to Mr. Bush's campaign theme that he is not a creature of the nation's gridlocked capital. ''It's a strong reminder that Governor Bush is cut from a different cloth from most of the Washington politicians,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''He's an outsider to Washington and comes from the more reformist, bipartisan wing of our party.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides said the governors would showcase their ideas and records in education and tax-cutting. The one Republican governor who will not be participating is Cecil H. Underwood of West Virginia, who is in a tough re-election fight. Mr. Fleischer said the effort would cost the Bush campaign about $500,000.

  Vice President Al Gore also is stepping up his use of campaign surrogates. Tipper Gore and Hadassah Lieberman are campaigning for their husbands. And this weekend, the former federal housing secretary Henry G. Cisneros, who was once the mayor of San Antonio, began an effort for the Gore campaign to lead surrogate campaigners in criticizing Mr. Bush's record in Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign is trying to use Mr. Bush's record in Texas to underscore its argument that Mr. Bush puts the interests of the wealthy and corporate interests before those of average Americans. Mr. Gore has been citing in particular statistics that show Texas last among the 50 states in families with health insurance coverage.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000

 <textdata>
  ''Maybe they can do a better job than he did of explaining his failed leadership in Texas,'' Mr. Hattaway said. ''Many Republican governors have managed to expand children's health care,'' he said, arguing that Mr. Bush had not followed their lead.
 </textdata>

  Even before the governors begin their campaign swing, Mr. Bush will send a team of women to the hotly contested states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The group includes Bush's wife, Laura; Lynne Cheney, the wife of his vice-presidential running mate Dick Cheney; and Barbara Bush, the former first lady. Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, and Cindy McCain, the wife of Mr. McCain, will also join the effort.

  Mr. Gore is leading among women, but Mr. Bush has been making inroads. Mindy Tucker, an aide to Mr. Bush, said the women would talk about issues important to women such as education, health care, safety and violence.

  The region in eastern Wisconsin is rich in undecided voters. The candidates know it. They apparently think that women hold the key to the valley vote and that women care most about education. Mr. Bush came to Appleton on Oct. 5 for an event at McKinley Elementary, a public school with a charter school on the second floor; he favors charter schools, which are independently run institutions paid for with public funds. Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, is due here on Monday for a visit to an all-public school.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And when the candidates and their surrogates are off campaigning somewhere else, there are endless commercials on Green Bay television stations to ensure that Appleton does not forget the campaign and its role. Mr. Gore alone ran 2,322 spots in this region between June 1 and September 30, and one of Mr. Bush's education commercials appears several dozen times every week.

  Numb they may be, but they, like other people in Wisconsin, are expected to vote heavily next month.  New registrations are up, and crowds -- like the throng of 6,000 to 8,000 that turned out for Mr. Gore in Milwaukee on Thursday -- are full of enthusiasm.
 </textdata>

  The state still seems there for the taking. Jeff Mayers, a veteran political reporter in Madison, Wisconsin's capital, said the last month had ''seen a lot of action but not much change.'' The most recent statewide public poll, showing Mr. Gore up by five percentage points, was completed for The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Sept. 20 -- more than three weeks ago, and well before the two presidential debates and the recent intensification of violence in the Middle East.

  Republican strategists say they sense movement in their direction, and private polls taken by Democrats here before Wednesday night's debate showed Mr. Bush taking the lead in the Fox River Valley and cutting into Mr. Gore's lead in Milwaukee. Two additional factors cheer the Republicans: they have more money for the stretch drive, and Mr. Bush seems to many in Wisconsin to have bested Mr. Gore in the second debate.

  Mr. Green argued that Mr. Bush, a governor preaching compassionate conservatism, would benefit from Mr. Thompson's innovative style of politics, which voters have grown accustomed to in electing him to four four-year terms.

  The valley has prospered during the Clinton-Gore years, others note, and there seems to be no particular reason for people here to want to change administrations. Taken together, the three area counties -- Brown (Green Bay), Outagamie (Appleton) and Winnebago (Oshkosh, Neenah and Menasha) -- voted for Mr. Bush's father in 1988, but supported Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996.

  Ken Harwood, the mayor of Neenah, listened to Mr. Bush struggling and said: ''He has to be prepared to answer that question over and over again. He needs to say, I understand business and industry, and I can create a balance that will sustain this economy.''

  So far, however, no issue has taken a dominant role, and a number of imponderables remain. One of the most important is Ralph Nader, the nominee of the Green Party, whose Wisconsin headquarters are prominently located on State Street, the funky pedestrian mall in Madison that links the State Capitol and the University of Wisconsin. Most politicians here thought that Mr. Nader would begin to lose strength as the campaign progressed, but he has held steady at 4 percent to 5 percent, which could cost Mr. Gore the state if it holds up at the polls.

  Few here will risk a guess, and the candidates are taking nothing for granted. Mr. Bush will return to the state next week, on the day after the final debate, probably to visit La Crosse, on the Mississippi River, and Eau Claire in western Wisconsin.

  The issue of capital punishment has been a recurrent theme during the presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.

  But the Gore campaign, to which the president has granted final say on his political travel schedule, has told him to concentrate on efforts to motivate black and Hispanic voters to get to the polls, and to limit his travel to states that the vice president is likely to win, including New York, where Mr. Clinton will appear at a rally on Tuesday for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

  In addition to traveling to New York, Mr. Clinton will go next week to Kentucky, where the Gore campaign has approved a visit to help a Democratic candidate for the House, and to California, for two public rallies and fund-raisers for three House candidates.

  Aides to Mr. Gore have studied polling data in deciding how Mr. Clinton might help, and Michigan is a prime example of the mixed reactions that they have determined a presidential visit would bring.

  The Gore campaign has also determined that Mr. Clinton would be a liability in other parts of the state, like Lansing, a relatively cosmopolitan college town, where he would discourage swing voters that the Gore campaign is counting on. And in Grand Rapids, where there are more conservative Republicans, he would likely energize Bush supporters.

  ''When you encounter an undecided voter, tell them the facts but then give them the passion in your hearts,'' Mr. Gore pleaded at a rally here at Carnegie Mellon University. ''Give me your help and give me your votes and give me your heart so I can fight for you, and I'll fight for your future.''

  Faced with polls that show his lead in Pennsylvania narrowing, Mr. Gore spent much of the day reiterating parts of his economic plan, pledging to eliminate the national debt, target tax cuts to certain middle-class voters and provide tax deductions for college tuition.

  Here and during a morning rally in West Virginia, Mr. Gore also cast himself as a friend of coal miners, lambasted the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush for television commercials that Gore aides said went over the line, and relied on leaders of the steelworkers union and the mine workers union to help promote his candidacy.

  And as he traveled through the industrial heart of the old economy, Mr. Gore spent a significant part of his day talking about the new one.

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said his approach to the economy could add 10 million high-tech jobs over the next decade. He said that over the next five years he wanted to double the federal government's spending on research in information technology, and over the next seven years double the amount spent on medical research.

  Tuesday will see Mr. Gore in California, the most important state and one where Mr. Gore's once commanding lead has also thinned somewhat. He is to tape an appearance for the ''Tonight'' show with Jay Leno. Mr. Bush is appearing on the Leno show the night before.

 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Madonna said that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush were both moving gingerly around two big issues here, abortion and gun control, and how they affect two important groups in this state -- Republican women in the suburbs who favor abortion rights and white Democratic men in the western part of the state who favor gun rights.

  ''You want somebody who understands coming from part of Appalachia,'' Mr. Gore said. ''My home in Tennessee is on the edge of Appalachia and my Congressional district that I started representing 24 years ago includes a big part of the district that is in Appalachia, with coal miners. I have spent many a Saturday night in a small courthouse filling out forms related to black lung.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000

  Mr. Gore and others noted that Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's running mate and a former member of Congress, voted 18 times against increasing federal benefits for victims of black-lung disease.

  The vice president also said essentially that the Bush campaign was distorting his positions in television commercials because it was in the grip of special interests.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The other side won't say to you plainly that they're in it to fight for the special interests,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Of course not. They fuzz it up, like the math. They will try to use all of the special-interest contributions to put misleading advertisements on the TV screen every few minutes to try to make you think that up is down and black is white and outside is inside.''

  In West Virginia Mr. Gore was joined by Cecil Roberts, national president of the United Mine Workers, who said the coal operators were for Mr. Bush while the coal miners were for Mr. Gore. He was also joined by Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and former president of the mine workers union. Mr. Trumka made a plea for Mr. Gore, and concluded by yelling, ''We know that Nov. 7 is the day that we take back the country!''

  Mr. Gore was introduced by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, who also vouched for Mr. Gore's devotion to coal. ''When Al Gore says that West Virginia is blessed by an abundance of coal,'' Mr. Rockefeller said, ''he knows the importance of coal, and he knows the importance of that to our future, doing it responsibly but doing it, mining it.''

  How eager are the national parties to win control? When a special election for a vacant seat in Scranton was held in June, Vice President Al Gore campaigned in the district; President Clinton recorded radio commercials; and Governor Ridge, along with other notable Republicans, made local appearances. With nearly 17,000 people voting, the Democratic candidate, Jim Wansacz, won by 752 votes over the Republican, Tom Parry.

  TEXAS SENATE -- A victory by Gov. George W. Bush could actually help the state's Democrats increase the party's 17-to-13 advantage in the Washington delegation. If Mr. Bush wins, his lieutenant governor, Rick Perry, a Republican, will become governor for two years until the next election. But the Texas Constitution provides that Mr. Perry's successor will be chosen by the Senate, in which Republicans hold a one-seat margin, with 15 of 31 seats up for election this year. The competition is so intense that in the race for the only open Senate seat, the Democratic and Republican candidates say they have raised a total of $3.3 million.

  Were I a politician, I would forcefully state that the vibrancy of the American economy for our children and grandchildren depends on our investment in basic science today. I would insist that the science budgets of the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense be strengthened. The only budget keeping up with the opportunities is that of the National Institutes of Health, and I would pledge -- as Al Gore did for cancer research -- that the momentum would be continued.

  Mr. Franks also taped a television interview for the program ''Inside Trenton.'' Like Mr. Corzine, he acknowledged public concerns about spending, and he did so by distancing himself from the large tax cuts proposed by his own party's presidential candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.

 <textdata>
  As he has barnstormed through Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan in recent days, Mr. Bush has succeeded in firing up huge rallies of dyed-in-the-wool Republicans, energetically conveying conservative ideas without using conservative buzzwords that might turn off the centrist Democrats and independent voters he also needs to win.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has called for big tax cuts, but he has spent almost as much time strongly defending two Democratic programs, Social Security and Medicare. He has endorsed the idea of school vouchers, but talks much more passionately about helping low-income students. He has praised the work of anti-abortion organizations without uttering the word abortion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In part, Mr. Bush's ability to rally his conservative base has stemmed from the potent combination of his personal charm and his supporters' gnawing hunger to put a Republican in the White House after eight years of the Clinton administration. But it also comes from choosing his words carefully.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Rather than mentioning abortion, which he opposes, Mr. Bush praises the work of crisis pregnancy centers, organizations typically staffed by abortion opponents, who counsel pregnant women against having the procedure.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''These are places of deep compassion,'' Mr. Bush said in Kalamazoo, as the audience whooped its approval.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Political scientists contend that Mr. Bush has little choice but to sidestep many of the contentious issues that divide Republicans from Democrats because the race is so close and he is competing in several states that have voted Democratic in recent years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000

  In Pennsylvania, Mr. Bush's positions on abortion, gun control and school vouchers all play well in the conservative western end, where he campaigned yesterday. But they turn off many moderate Republicans and centrist Democrats, particularly women, in the suburbs outside Philadelphia. So he barely mentioned them, or mentioned them only obliquely, in his most recent visit on Thursday.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is Bush's way of raising morality issues without going down a road that offends suburban Republican women,'' said G. Terry Madonna, a political scientist at Millersville University in Pennsylvania.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush's message has clearly been getting through to its intended audiences. At each of his stops in recent days, Mr. Bush has been drawing huge, enthusiastic audiences, usually of several thousand people. They have stamped their feet, waved little flags and stood in wild ovation for their candidate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He doesn't have to talk about abortion,'' said Anna May Conelley, 65, who heard Mr. Bush in Kalamazoo. ''We know where he stands.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's ability to communicate his conservative message to conservative voters has also been greatly abetted by the work of independent groups that support him, like the National Right to Life Committee, the National Rifle Association and Americans for Tax Reform. All have financed commercials, mailings, Web sites and newsletters to their members, which have praised Mr. Bush's positions on the military, tax cuts, abortion or gun control.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has also avoided directly attacking President Clinton, who won in both Pennsylvania and Michigan in 1996.
 </textdata>

  Both candidates realize they may be helped by politicians higher up on their tickets, though those benefits may cancel each other out. Mr. Lazio  remains very popular in the district, but Democratic polls show Mr. Gore running ahead of George W. Bush by 5 to 8 percentage points in the presidential race.

  From inflammatory telephone calls to voters by allies of Vice President Al Gore, to incendiary new television spots by supporters of Gov. George W.

  In Michigan, the state Democratic Party placed calls to thousands of voters, with recorded messages from two women relating stories of death and illness in Governor Bush's Texas. In Wisconsin and the Northwest, a Republican group planned to begin running commercials showing footage of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, attacking Mr. Gore's environmental record.

  Attack advertisements from outside groups are multiplying, and the automated phone campaigns are reported to be spreading to states like Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania. One phone message, recorded for the Democrats by the actor Ed Asner, warns listeners that Mr. Bush's plans for reforming Social Security could threaten ''current benefits.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In one recorded call, a Texas woman, Ann Friday, implies that Mr. Bush's failure to improve nursing home care in Texas contributed to the death of her husband, who died ''from an illness that his nursing home attendants failed to notice.'' In another, a woman from Houston, Charlotte Cherry, says of Mr. Bush's ''terrible record on the environment'': ''Governor Bush has accepted $1.3 million from corporate polluters, and he's allowed them to keep polluting while my kids suffer.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Republicans denounced the Michigan messages as ''despicable,'' and Karen P. Hughes, the Bush campaign communications director, said of the Ann Friday message, ''It is wrong for Vice President Gore to try to use a tragedy involving an elderly woman for his own political purposes.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Democrats countered that the spot by the Republican Leadership Council using Mr. Nader's words against Mr. Gore was the true low blow. In the advertisement, which begins running on Monday in Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin, states in which Mr. Nader has substantial support, a sound bite is played in which Mr. Nader says, ''Al Gore is suffering from election-year delusion if he thinks his record on the environment is anything to be proud of.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Nader campaign did not think much of the commercial, either. ''The ad fails to mention that George W. Bush also has an abysmal environmental record,'' said Laura Jones, a Nader spokeswoman.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The new moves came as criticism mounted of a Texas group backing Mr. Bush that began running an anti-Gore commercial yesterday modeled on the notorious ''Daisy'' spot that the Democrats ran against Barry Goldwater in 1964. The spot, which ran in small and medium-sized cities in swing states like Florida, Missouri and Ohio, shows a young  girl counting the petals of a flower and then switches to the countdown to a missile launching. Its message is that the United States is vulnerable to a nuclear attack from China because the Clinton administration traded away national security in return for campaign contributions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The commercial drew a furious condemnation by the Gore campaign. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the vice-presidential nominee, described the spot as ''the kind of sneak attack that we adopted legislation to stop, where moneyed interests come in at critical moments.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even Mr. Bush's advisers distanced themselves from the commercial; Ms. Hughes called the spot an ''anonymous attack ad that is in no way associated with our campaign'' and the kind the governor would seek to have abolished.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Hughes added that Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, called the group sponsoring the ''Daisy'' commercial, Aretino Industries, yesterday to ask that it be pulled.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cramer said Aretino's members, whom he has declined to name, decided to withdraw the spot because ''they did not want to hurt the Bush campaign.'' He added that the news media's reporting on the spot was drowning out its message.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Despite the modest size of the advertising ''buy,'' the Gore campaign went to great lengths yesterday to spread the word about the spot. In e-mail messages to reporters, the campaign identified Mr. Cramer as an executive of the Meridian Group, ''a consulting firm with ties to Newt Gingrich.'' The message continued,  ''Cramer is a follower of Machiavellian principles.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''These are real people leaving a message that is not scary,'' said Jennifer Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, adding that they follow the Democrats' established practice of questioning Mr. Bush's record.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Cherry, whose voice is heard in the phone call warning about pollution in Texas, said in an interview yesterday that she taped her message for the Democrats on Wednesday, but that partisanship was not her motivation. A secretary who lives in Houston, Ms. Cherry said that she and her neighbors had long been trying to get Mr. Bush to address their concerns about emissions from chemical plants near her home.

  On Thursday, Vice President Al Gore in Madison, Wis., a Nader stronghold,  suggested that oil companies wanted people to ''vote for George Bush or in any case vote for Ralph Nader.''

  O.K., fine. But how would she feel if she helped elect George W. Bush? Three times, the question was asked. Three times, she shrugged.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000

 <textdata>
  ''I'm really not focused on Bush and Gore,'' came the unflappable response. ''I'm focused  on the Nader campaign.''

  Push-polling usually arises in frenzy at the end of campaigns, when politicians hope their tactics will not draw scrutiny. Just before the Republican presidential primary last March in South Carolina, Senator John McCain accused the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of using this strategy, which Mr. Bush denied.

 <textdata>
  A leader, he tells crowds, does not pit one group of people against another. To lead, he says, is to stand firm on convictions, wrap one's fingers around even the thorniest problems and take the long view, no matter what the short-term impact. Variations on those words and themes course through almost every one of Mr. Bush's speeches.

  ''We're a government of the people, by the people, and for the people,'' Mr. Bush said in Knoxville, Tenn., on Tuesday. ''We're not a government of Washington, for Washington and by Washington.''
 </textdata>

  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush addresses specific issues, too: tax cuts, Social Security, Medicare, education. But what is most striking about his stump speech in this final, mad dash toward the finish line of the presidential race is the way in which almost every subject he discusses, almost every claim he makes, bolsters a more diffuse argument about character and tone.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The current iteration of Mr. Bush's stump speech, which has evolved considerably in the 16 months since he began his presidential campaign, provides a perfect window into the fundamental questions that dog his bid for the White House and his chosen strategies for answering them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The pundits have been saying, you know, that people don't want tax relief,'' Mr. Bush told the crowd in Knoxville, defending his tax-cut proposal, which many political analysts consider a liability. ''You know what my answer is?'' he continued. ''I really don't care what the polls say. I'm standing before you because I do what I think is right.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He also insists that the choice before voters is not between jeopardizing prosperity and continuing it, as Mr. Gore claims, but between a shepherd of that wealth whose leadership they can respect and one whose methods are manipulative.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I want to remind you of what my opponent said in Los Angeles, California, in his convention speech,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He said to the people out there he is going to make sure the 'right people' get tax relief.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I want you to think about that for a potential president of the United States,'' Mr. Bush added, then liberally translated Mr. Gore's remarks. ''He said, 'Put me in Washington and I'm going to decide who the right people are.' That's not the way we think. That's not the American way.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's stump speech also reflects his considerable growth as a candidate. In the beginning, he delivered virtually the same remarks, in the same order, with the same intonation, wherever he went, as if clinging to a life line. Now he confidently rearranges the pieces.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One aspect of Mr. Bush's speech has proved timeless, and its stamina underscores how firmly he believes that if the election turns on values and character, victory will be his.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Always, at the close, Mr. Bush envisions his inauguration and the act of putting his ''hand on the Bible.'' He says he will be pledging not only to uphold the laws of the land, but also ''to uphold the honor and the integrity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.''

  It's time to knock down that toll booth on the road to the middle class. I've heard all the talk about rich people versus poor people. That's class warfare that Mr. Gore likes to put onto people. That's not how you lead. That's not what this nation needs. This nation needs somebody to bring us together. This nation needs a healer, not a divider. This nation needs somebody, somebody, who's going to stop the bickering and fighting and name-calling in Washington, D.C. . . .

  In his quest for that percentage, Mr. Nader could drain enough votes from Mr. Gore to hand victory to the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and the Republicans are now trying to capitalize on that possibility.
 </textdata>

  One group, the Republican Leadership Council, has prepared a television commercial in which Mr. Nader attacks Mr. Gore and is ready to broadcast it in Oregon, Washington and and Wisconsin, where the Green Party has made significant inroads among Democrats.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The commercial features a clip from a speech Mr. Nader made earlier this week. ''Al Gore is suffering from election-year delusions if he thinks his record on the environment is anything to be proud of,'' Mr. Nader is quoted as saying.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign reacted angrily to that advertisement, noting that Mr. Nader also had some choice words for Mr. Bush in the speech (calling him ''nothing more than a corporation running for president disguised as a person'') that the Republicans had left out of the commercial.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000

 <textdata>
  ''They've given up all hope of selling Mr. Bush,'' said Kym Spell, a Gore campaign spokeswoman, ''so now they're selling Nader.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Nader had his own suggestion. ''Why don't the Democrats take my comments on Bush and do the same?'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Lieberman confronted the Nader dilemma head-on, arguing that voting for Mr. Nader would only help Gov. George W. Bush, by draining votes from Vice President Al Gore.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'd urge you to think about how you'll feel on Nov. 8 and you wake up and George Bush has carried Oregon and is president because a lot of people voted for Nader,'' he said to Mike Manning and Bob Anderson, a pair of Nader supporters eating breakfast in the Bijou Cafe, an organic food restaurant.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said he found Mr. Bush repellent, but added: ''I will vote for Nader. I've got to think about my conscience.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Meanwhile, at a rally here tonight, Mr. Nader and his supporters continued to talk about their sense that the Democratic Party has betrayed its liberal roots, pointing out its support for the death penalty, the war on drugs, strict new limits on the welfare system and a host of other causes. There was less mention made of the possibility that, by taking votes away from Mr. Gore, Mr. Nader could deliver the election to Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Democrats, alarmed at the possibility have mounted an aggressive campaign to try to reclaim the votes of people who are leaning Green. Advocates of abortion rights have bought television advertisements warning that a vote for Mr. Nader is as good as a vote for Mr. Bush and could therefore endanger legal abortions. Environmentalists warn about Mr. Bush's record in Texas. And liberal Democrats have been sent to rally the faithful.

  Joseph E. Mann, a Democratic district leader in South Norwalk, is a party loyalist who has never considered voting for George W. Bush. But he disagrees pointedly with Mr. Gore's support for the death penalty. ''I happen to not be for it,'' Mr. Mann said. ''I think there are too many problems associated with it, especially for minorities.'' He added, ''I just don't think it's a deterrent and I don't think it's civilized.''

  Cassandra Eaton, a private music instructor, said that as a black woman, she might not see eye to eye with Mr. Gore on all issues, but she considered his policies appealing to the middle class. ''Right now he is offering more for us in the middle class,'' she said. ''I am looking for someone to identify with. Obviously, the racial thing I can't identify with him. But there is something there, I am hoping. He has that edge for me.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For this reason, Ms. Eaton said she could put aside her differences with Mr. Gore on school vouchers. As a 60-year-old grandmother of two young boys, 7-year-old Eric and 3-year-old Anthony, Ms. Eaton said she would like to see private school available to them. ''If I could get them in private school through vouchers, I would,'' she said. ''I would want that option.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The voucher issue is far less crucial in Connecticut, a state that is firmly in the grasp of Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, than it is in Michigan, a swing state. There, a statewide ballot referendum on vouchers has drawn attention to a philosophical disagreement between Mr. Bush, who supports vouchers, and Michigan's Republican governor, John Engler, who opposes them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Robert E. Burgess, the director of Norwalk Economic Opportunity Now, a local nonprofit social service organization, said he was more concerned about the economy and Social Security but that he did agree with Mr. Gore on vouchers. ''The majority of kids in this country are in public school, and public school will always be needed,'' he said. ''So the voucher will be counterproductive to helping the majority of the children.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although he parts ways with Mr. Gore on school vouchers, he says he understands Mr. Gore's criticism of them. ''It's a Band-Aid,'' he said. ''But Band-Aids stop bleeding and they stop infection one day at a time. The true battle is about making the school systems equal. The quick fix-'ems are vouchers, obviously busing, etc.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Those are just Band-Aids and any person worth his or her salt recognizes that,'' Mr. Farrison said, adding that Mr. Gore has the right long-term idea. ''He is saying exactly what I am saying. He is saying, 'Let's not use the Band-Aid, let's fix the system.' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Rev. Albert D. Tyson, pastor of Bethel A.M.E. Church, said he agreed with Mr. Gore on vouchers and planned to vote for him because he favored the Democrats' economic proposals. Mr. Tyson, who is 73, said that his vote for Mr. Gore would not be deterred by his passionate disagreement with the vice president on the death penalty. After all, Mr. Tyson and other voters noted, Mr. Bush's home state of Texas has carried out more executions than any other state.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, Mr. Tyson said he wished that Mr. Gore had a different view. ''Once a person's life is taken, you can't give it back to them if you have made a mistake,'' he said. ''And the justice system is not perfect, and that disturbs me.''

  If George W. Bush is elected, one probable result will be to put meaningful campaign finance reform off indefinitely. That is not only because Governor Bush is opposed to serious change in the system. It is because of the appointments he is likely to make to the Supreme Court, which has the last word on whether and how campaign spending can be limited.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That reality poses a hard question for Ralph Nader and his supporters. Mr. Nader has quite rightly called for an end to the obscene race for money that now marks political campaigns in this country. Yet he tells his rallies that there is no real difference between Governor Bush and Al Gore, ignoring the profound impact a Bush-appointed Supreme Court would have on the chance for reform.

  But conservative legal theory advanced by judicial appointees of Presidents Reagan and Bush is a forbidding obstacle to national environmental regulation. Some of those judges, in the Federal Courts of Appeals, have found regulations invalid either because Congress delegated rule-making power to administrative agencies -- which is the only way regulating gets done -- or because the rules went beyond federal power over interstate commerce.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Campaign finance reform would be impossible if the views of Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -- whom Governor Bush has called his models -- prevailed. They wrote last January that any limits on either campaign spending or contributions violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
 </textdata>

  Nor do I believe that George W. Bush has fixed, extremist views on the law. He does not seem to have thought deeply about the kinds of questions that go into the appointment of Supreme Court justices. In Texas, judges are elected. Governor Bush has filled vacancies, however, and his appointees on the whole are respected judges, conservative but eschewing the extreme.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the realities of the Republican Party these days -- the highly conservative party it has become -- will severely limit a President George W. Bush's choices if and when Supreme Court vacancies arise. The right will expect nominees who reliably embrace its views.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush is surely aware of the bitterness on the right about one of his father's choices, Justice David Souter. In the primary campaign Steve Forbes, opposing Governor Bush, said, ''America simply cannot afford another Supreme Court justice like David Souter.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000

 <textdata>
  Abortion is the prime issue for the right. Mr. Bush has said he would not make it a litmus test that his nominees would overrule Roe v. Wade. But in practice that will surely be a consideration. A leading anti-abortion figure, Gary Bauer, said on NBC's ''Today'' show the other day that if Mr. Bush became president and had more than one vacancy to fill on the Supreme Court, it was likely that ''Roe v. Wade would be overturned.''
 </textdata>

  All this makes Ralph Nader's performance cynical. He knows better than most people what a difference a Bush or Gore presidency could make in the Supreme Court. Yet he gives the impression, as a Wall Street Journal report put it, that ''he would be happy to cause a Gore defeat.'' And Mr. Nader is campaigning hard in states where his support could cost Mr. Gore the electoral vote. Yesterday he was in Iowa, a toss-up state.

  Muslim Group Backs Bush

 <textdata>
  Earlier this week, a Muslim political action committee, affiliated with the American Muslim Political Coordinating Council, which represents four Islamic organizations in the United States, said it was endorsing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential candidate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Coincidentally, that decision followed by less than a week the publication of a broad, though unscientific, survey of political opinion among American Muslims, a group that may number as many as six million. The survey, undertaken by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy organization that belongs to the coordinating council, found Mr. Bush ahead of the pack.
 </textdata>

  With time running out, here is how things stand for Al Gore in heavily Democratic West Virginia: Even among a crowd that had  gotten up extra early to stand in line for his rally on the statehouse steps this morning, a surprising number of people said they were either wobbly in their choice or had already decided to vote Republican.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A steady trickle of those who came began leaving shortly after Mr. Gore started talking. And when Senator John D. Rockefeller IV told the crowd that Mr. Gore was especially in sync with West Virginians because ''He's an Appalachian, just like us,'' there were groans.

  West Virginia is a place where Mr. Gore should not even have to show up. But with only 10 days to go, he is in a statistical dead heat nationally, and trailing here. Today's banner headline in The Charleston Daily Mail read: ''Bush Leads in New State Poll,'' over an article that showed the vice president down by 10 points in one survey.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Gore's environmental record has been cast as a negative, a threat to coal miners, though the vice president has in fact pushed for increased health benefits for miners. Neither Mr. Gore nor his critics mention that his own father, Senator Albert Gore Sr., ran a coal company, Island Creek, after he was voted out of office in 1970 and that the company was heavily criticized by environmental groups.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, some here who are not supporting the vice president said they had not been turned off only by these tactics. And the crowd waiting to see Mr. Gore seemed not so much scared as bored.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Over and over, even people who said they supported Mr. Gore gave this as their sole reason: ''I'm a Democrat.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Tom Daugherty, a Realtor, sighed and said, ''He's better than Bush.'' His wife, Chris, a state worker with the division of environmental protection, was even less enthusiastic. ''I don't like any of them,'' she said. ''I want another choice.''
 </textdata>

  Rebecca Willis, who was there to chaperone an elementary school class, said of Mr. Bush, ''I think he's for all the people, where Gore stresses middle class, middle class.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Standing next to him, a co-worker, Jason Crowder, said he would definitely vote for Mr. Bush. ''I just want his values,'' he said, adding, ''I just came here to see the vice president. You never get a chance to see that.''

  Bob Wise, the Democratic candidate for governor, cried, ''Let the word go forth from every hill and hollow: 'Al Gore for president.' ''
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers, was both more dire and more colorful. ''George Bush has been here saying coal miners are for him. They're confused. Coal operators are for him,'' he yelled. He told the crowd that Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, had voted 18 times in Congress to cut benefits for coal miners. Then, in the biggest applause line of the day, he thrilled groups of schoolchildren in the crowd by crudely describing the dimensions of Newt Gingrich's backside.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Mr. Gore took the microphone, rolling up his shirt sleeves as he began, he laughed and offered special thanks to Mr. Roberts. ''He'll probably be hearing again from Newt Gingrich,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore left no doubt that he was fully aware of his predicament here, telling the crowd that Republicans ''tremble at the thought that all their efforts at confusion won't work and you'll see all their fuzzy-ness.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The line drew applause, but one local Democrat suggested that in the most backhanded possible compliment to the Clinton-Gore administration, maybe West Virginians had gotten too comfortable to care. ''They can't stand prosperity,'' said Charlie Hodge, a retired steel worker.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And on the way out, Mrs. Willis, a Bush supporter coming and going, gave this assessment: ''It ran a little long and my back hurts. I'll have to go home and do a hot tub.''

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I don't think I ever got caught speeding on my motorcycle,'' Mr. Gore answered. ''Certainly I got caught speeding in my car when I was younger. But that wasn't to say I wasn't speeding sometimes on my motorcycle. I look back on those days and I feel like I'm very lucky to have survived.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Actually, there was a blue light,'' Mr. Gore answered. ''And I can't say for sure that they were coming after us, but just on the chance that they were, we cut through an alleyway.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And finally: ''On a woman, leather or lace?'' Mr. Gore mulled for a moment, then answered: ''Lace.''

  ''How many of you own a rooftop photovoltaic system?'' Mr. Bush asked crowds at several campaign rallies this week, ridiculing Vice President Al Gore's proposal to give tax credits to homeowners who install solar panels for electricity. His message was that the vice president's approach to tax cuts was convoluted and, to many voters, irrelevant.

  What Mr. Bush did not note was that he included essentially the same proposal when he outlined his energy policy last month. It was on the final pages of a long document, but it was there: a promise, like Mr. Gore's, to give a tax credit of up to $2,000 to homeowners who decided to harness energy from the sun.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And while Mr. Bush frequently tears into Mr. Gore's ''targeted'' tax cuts for voters who, for example, put money into certain kinds of investment accounts, there are targets in his own proposals.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000

 <textdata>
  Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that to draw any such similarity was to  miss Mr. Bush's larger point: that what Mr. Gore is trying to sell as widespread tax relief comes almost entirely in the form of deductions and credits, leaving many Americans without benefit.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, by contrast, would reduce tax rates in every income bracket, in an effort, Mr. Bartlett said, to make sure everybody who pays taxes gets a break.  Mr. Bartlett said the Bush campaign's tax incentives for specific purposes were simply icing on the cake.

  Secluded at a sprawling wooded resort 50 miles west of St. Louis, Mr. Gore brought together 10 of the average citizens who helped prepare him on his first two debates and 13 other citizens from Missouri as he sought to repeat the best of his earlier performances and eliminate the worst.

  The final debate, at 9 p.m. on Tuesday -- the candidates' last sure-fire way of reaching millions of voters in what may be the closest election in four decades -- will be in the style of a town meeting, in which citizens selected by the Gallup organization  will ask the questions. A third of the participants are undecided; a third favor Mr. Gore and a third prefer Mr. Bush.

  Mr. Daley also said that Mr. Bush's Texas record was fair game. And the vice president can be expected, as he did in the second debate, to play down his views on gun control. Mr. Daley said that the National Rifle Association had effectively spent millions of dollars on television commercials scaring sportsmen and hunters into believing that Mr. Gore wanted to take away their guns.

  ''Voters have seen too many Al Gores in the last two debates,'' he added. ''He's got to be the person he's going to be in the next four years.'' Leaving aside the question of whether Mr. Gore knew who he was, Mr. Hart said of the differing personas he had presented in the debates: ''The voter gets confused.''

  Mr. Gore found his first session this morning with the real people so valuable that instead of rehearse in the afternoon with his political advisers, he held a second session with the unpaid advisers.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  At the opening of the first, which reporters were allowed to attend for just a few minutes, Mr. Gore said that if he is elected president, ''I will have regular open meetings all across the country with citizens from all walks of life to help shape the agenda of the Gore-Lieberman administration.''

  Unusually for a presidential candidate just three weeks before an election, Mr. Gore is spending three full days out of the public eye, with no campaign events Sunday, Monday or Tuesday. Some of this is in deference to the Middle East crisis, which is dominating the news. And Mr. Gore does not plan to travel Wednesday until after the memorial service for the American sailors killed in Yemen is conducted.

  But it also gives him a chance to focus intently on how to repair the damage he seems to have done to himself in the first two debates.

  But it remains unclear what role Mr. Pitofsky will play in the Chevron-Texaco deal, because it is by no means certain he will remain at the agency. The chairman of the F.T.C. serves at the pleasure of the president, and if Vice President Gore wins the election, there is a broad expectation that Mr. Pitofsky would continue in his post. On the other hand, if Gov. George W. Bush were to prevail, it is not known who would lead the agency. Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's foreign policy adviser, is a Chevron board member.

  If there has been a low point for the press following the Bush-Gore campaign, surely it has been the mass rush to judgment that because George W. Bush was able to tick off world hot spots in the last debate, he understands foreign policy enough to be president. In fact, Mr. Bush uttered a stunning howler during that debate. When asked by Jim Lehrer which of the recent U.S. interventions abroad he would approve of, Mr. Bush said he did not approve of Haiti, but he did approve of Lebanon in 1982. Oh, really? Too bad Mr. Lehrer did not have time to ask him: ''Governor Bush, what was it about Lebanon that you liked?''

  The devil in this region -- and the solution -- is in the details. Foreign policy problems rarely come packaged in your ideal way. They always come messy, spurred as much by the fecklessness of allies as the mendacity of enemies. And they can be solved only by some combination of military might, detailed, patient diplomacy and, yes, some cautious optimism. When you approach them with superficial cliches, an unwillingness to master details and an over-reliance on military power, you end up with America in Lebanon in 1982 -- one of George W. Bush's preferred foreign policy moments. Scary.

  ''Our opponents in this campaign, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, have sometimes argued when I raise issues about the status of the U.S. military today, they sometimes argue that you shouldn't talk about it, that somehow it's unpatriotic to have this conversation,'' Mr. Cheney, a former defense secretary, told a rally at Evangel University here.

  In recent days, both campaigns have cautiously sought to use the attack on the Cole and the crisis in the Middle East to support their positions.

George W. Bush.

  The confluence of the playoffs with the presidential and vice presidential debates probably skimmed some viewers from baseball on Oct. 3, 5 and 11. Fox did not pre-empt baseball for the debates, while NBC gave its affiliates the option of doing so when it had a game. On Oct. 11, when the cumulative rating for the debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas reached a 26.8 on seven broadcast and cable networks, Fox recorded a 6.8 for Game 1 of the Mets-Cardinals National League Championship Series. Four years ago, Game 6 of the N.L.C.S. on Fox generated an 11.9 rating compared with a 26.1 cumulative rating for the Bill Clinton-Bob Dole presidential debate.

  No one doubts that both Al Gore and George W. Bush want to make this country greater. Does it really matter if Mr. Bush stumbles on his words? Dwight D.

  The Democratic Party, with much smaller cash reserves, is less concerned with expansion than with refining its strategy, fashioning television and radio attack advertisements for specific states and specific issues: the Everglades piece in Florida, for example; a pollution spot directed at voters in Washington State; an advertisement about the minimum wage in West Virginia; and a radio spot about children in Iowa asserting that ''George Bush's priorities are wrong for Iowa's kids.''

  However, some $5 million that has been spent on behalf of Mr. Gore by outside groups like the Sierra Club, Handgun Control and Planned Parenthood has brought the two sides to temporary parity. In fact, the study found in the two weeks that ended on Oct. 8, Planned Parenthood's expenditure of $1.46 million actually exceeded the amount paid out for commercials by the Democratic National Committee. Groups allied with the Republicans, like the National Rife Association, have only just begun advertising.

He found that while the number of statements in the spots attacking the opposing side have been rising in recent weeks, the level of vitriol remains relatively mild. About 29 percent of the statements in Mr. Gore's spots and 17 percent in Mr. Bush's could be interpreted as attacks, Mr. Benoit said.

  Ms. Sanchez and several other union members from Texas -- a sheet-metal worker, a corrections officer and a retired cafeteria worker -- have spoken to labor audiences in 15 cities.

  They have repeatedly portrayed Mr. Bush as indifferent to working families, hostile to unions and cozy with corporations and the rich. Alex Flores, the sheet-metal worker, attacked Mr. Bush for not pushing to change his state's $3.35-an-hour minimum wage, which is paid to many Texas farm workers not covered by the $5.15-an-hour federal minimum. And Irenier Ford, who retired last year after working for 28 years in a school cafeteria, criticized Mr. Bush's Social Security proposals, saying he would push up the age for full benefits to age 70 and hurt struggling retirees like herself.

  Mr. Sweeney said, ''We're the reason he won the nomination, and we will be the margin of victory on Nov. 7.

With the exception of trade issues, they have been there for us when we needed them.''

  COME AGAIN? -- Last week Al Gore and his aides were quick to deride George W. Bush for tripping over his own numbers while trying to explain his tax cut proposal at a rally in Florida. In the second debate, Mr. Gore pointed out that he ''wasn't the one having trouble explaining'' his plans.

  But Mr. Gore does at times have that trouble. Last Tuesday during a forum in Florida, on Wednesday during the debate and again on Friday in Milwaukee, he misstated his proposal for a tuition-based tax break by saying he would help parents ''send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition, per child, per year.'' In fact, as ABC News pointed out on Thursday, the proposal calls for a $10,000 deduction per family per year, not per child.

Others said they were pleased that he had mentioned two issues important to Arabs during the second presidential debate: racial profiling and the government's use of secret evidence in deportation cases. And still others said they were concerned that the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, is Jewish.

He said he had written a letter to the local police a year earlier but had received no response.

  Mike Jones, a spokesman for Governor Bush's office, confirmed that the letter arrived in 1998 and remains on file. Mr. Jones said about 1,400 letters from inmates were received by the governor's office every year, and standard policy calls for forwarding them to the appropriate law enforcement agency. But, he said, Mr. Marino's letter fell into a different category because it indicated that a copy was also being sent to Mr. Earle. In such cases, Mr. Jones said, a letter would not be forwarded, to ''avoid duplication.''

  Austin police also said an investigator visited Mr. Ochoa in 1998 after his department received Mr. Marino's letter that was addressed to Governor Bush. An official said Mr. Ochoa was questioned about the case again and continued to maintain that he had committed the crime. Mr. Scheck, however, said that Mr. Ochoa was simply fearful that investigators were trying to implicate him in another crime.

  ''If you had a moderator who was trying to accentuate the differences, that would have been a fabulous debate,'' said Senator Bob Kerrey,  Democrat of Nebraska, who blamed Mr. Lehrer for not pressing the candidates, especially Gov. George W. Bush, on the issues in the debate last week. ''You could have picked 10 people off the street who didn't know Jerusalem from Georgia,'' Mr. Kerrey said, ''and they would have had better questions.''

  Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, suggested that Mr. Lehrer did not adequately rein in Vice President Al Gore during the first debate. ''Gore kept interrupting and violating the rules, and Lehrer must have clearly been taken aback,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''Let me say this: I think that Lehrer did a better job in the second debate.''
 </textdata>

  Gore supporters, on the other hand, have been especially vociferous in their criticism. Among their complaints is that in the second debate Mr. Lehrer said, incorrectly, that there were Gore commercials depicting Mr. Bush as a bungler. They also noted that in several of the exchanges at the end of the debate Mr. Lehrer allowed Mr. Bush to get the last word.

  Some Gore campaign advisers said they now regretted that they prevailed when, in pre-debate negotiations with the Bush organization,  they pressed for Mr. Lehrer as the moderator. Bush campaign officials had proposed Tim Russert of NBC,  according to people involved in the talks, although at one stage they suggested Larry King of CNN and perhaps Mr. Lehrer for one debate each. In the end, Mr. Lehrer got all three, and Bernard Shaw moderated the vice-presidential debate.

  Part of Mr. Lieberman's shift in tone meant softening the criticism of Gov. George W. Bush that has been a standard part of his stump speech, though that criticism was hardly absent. He belittled Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts and his prescription drug plan for retirees. The Bush drug plan would give money to the states in the early years to cover only some of the elderly poor, and would then rely on vouchers to help people buy private insurance coverage -- coverage that Mr. Lieberman said the insurers would not be willing to sell.

  For several reasons, the contests here between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are being fiercely fought and are ranked as tossups right now. To some degree, of course, the closeness of the race in the Pacific Northwest reflects the same dynamics at play in much of the rest of the nation. But other factors are more specific to the region, such as the relatively high popularity here of Ralph Nader and perhaps even the resentment widely felt in the Seattle area over the Clinton administration's antitrust case against Microsoft.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In Seattle, more television advertisements have been run for the candidates than in any other metropolitan market in the nation, except for Philadelphia -- a total of 5,921 (3,037 for the Gore campaign, 2,884 for the Bush campaign) from June 1 through Oct. 8, according to a tracking survey conducted by the Brennan Center at the New York University School of Law. The survey ranks the Portland metropolitan area No. 7.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's not that there is any great shift of political ideology going on this year'' in the region, said Robert E. Gogerty, a political strategist in Seattle who generally works for Democrats. ''It's that Gore has just not bonded with people in the Northwest, at least not yet. And if he can't do it here, he's going to have trouble in a lot of places.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Were Mr. Nader not in the race, it is possible that the Gore-Lieberman campaign might, if not take the Northwest for granted, at least not have to worry so much about it. But Mr. Gore seems to be suffering from political leanings among many here that are so solidly on the left that discontent with him runs very strong in some places.

  The other half, he added, might well decide in the end that the race between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore is so close that they want to have an impact on it. But even here, Mr. Hibbitts added, those voters will not necessarily vote uniformly for Mr. Gore, though he should claim the lion's share. In interviews, some pro-Nader voters have suggested that they would prefer Mr. Bush to Mr. Gore because they believe a Bush presidency is more likely to inspire the kind of anger and opposition that truly ignite what they describe as a progressive, third-party movement for future years.

  Mr. Bush has taken a stand opposing plans to breach the dams.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''People have been able to make a living off rivers and at the same time coexist with nature,'' he said at a rally in Spokane last month at which he vowed: ''If George W. Bush becomes president, the dams will not be breached.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And, he added, to more applause, as if he were addressing Mr. Gore directly: ''These dams are important to a way of life, Mr. Vice President.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Such a stance, at a minimum, has strengthened Mr. Bush's support in a conservative region that would be likely to side with him regardless and that Mr. Gore has visited just once in recent years. It may even bring out some voters who otherwise might not make it to the polls, analysts say.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In many ways, the debate crystallizes the region's tensions between economic development and ''livability'' concerns such as sprawl and stronger environmental protection. But as energy costs have mounted and the specter of electricity shortages looms, the idea of doing away with dams supplying about 4 percent of the region's electric power has become more controversial, and Mr. Gore is trying hard not to alienate anyone on the matter. Still, some voters here may simply be irritated at their perception that he is waffling.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The dams are one of those issues that kind of adds to a cumulative level of frustration with Gore, and continues to cause people to look at Nader,'' said Bill Arthur, the Northwest/Alaska regional director of the Sierra Club. ''On the other hand, as an organization, we certainly have endorsed Gore. Our members recognize there's a Grand Canyon's worth of difference between Gore and Bush on the environment.''

  And then there is the Microsoft case. Many people who work in the high-tech industry region in the Seattle area classify themselves as politically liberal. But lingering anger over the Microsoft case seems to have blunted some of the potential enthusiasm for Mr. Gore. (Microsoft itself and its employees have given more to Mr. Bush and the Republican National Committee than to Mr. Gore and the Democratic committee, finance records show.)

  ''I can't wait to remind people that the day of the New Democrat is evidently over,'' he said to a cheering crowd that had gathered despite a drizzle.

  Arkansas is one of the states that Mr. Gore is counting on to avoid a shutout across the South. It voted twice for its favorite son, Bill Clinton, and was only one of five states that Mr. Gore won in the Democratic primaries in 1988 when he made his last presidential bid.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the state has been leaning more toward Republicans in recent years. Gov. Mike Huckabee and Senator Tim Hutchinson, both Republicans, shared the stage with Mr. Bush, as did Representative Asa Hutchinson, the senator's brother, who had been one of Mr. Clinton's prosecutors in his Senate impeachment trial.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And while Mr. Gore has been running a barrage of television advertisements here, he has not been able to establish a lead. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in Little Rock conducted a poll two weeks ago that  had the race in a dead heat.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was introduced today by Erma Hendrix, a former Little Rock board member who switched from Democrat to Republican in 1980 after a run-in with the Democratic Party over a race for the State House of Representatives. Mr. Clinton was the Democratic governor at the time.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You've had a history of dealing with those folks up in Washington, D.C.,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to her dispute with Mr. Clinton and the Democrats when she was not allowed into a primary runoff in her bid to become representative even though a court said she was entitled to the spot in the runoff because of a dispute over uncounted ballots.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Hendrix praised Mr. Bush for his stand on ''empowering the people and the pro-life issue,'' and he gave her a big hug.
 </textdata>

  Later this evening, Mr. Bush arrived here in St. Louis where he was endorsed by the National Troopers Association, which represents 35,000 state troopers and highway patrol officers. As he accepted the endorsement, Mr. Bush criticized Mr. Gore, who noticeably changed his style between the first and second debates.
 </textdata>

  With the race in a dead heat, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore will seek to press an advantage in the final debate Tuesday night, which for the first time will feature audience questions and comes at a time when violence in the Middle East has put foreign affairs at center stage. The governor practiced for the debate this morning in Austin, Tex., and was expected to conduct another run-through on Tuesday.

  These are all open questions. But there are still two more debates for Mr. Bush to regroup in. The place he must improve most tomorrow is on foreign policy. Mr. Bush's answers to the foreign policy questions were so deeply, deeply shallow that you could only wonder: Is he that unfamiliar with the material and uncomfortable with the issues, or have his foreign policy advisers simply not prepared him because they themselves are unprepared for this world? I think it was a little of both.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-10-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Consider the moment when Mr. Bush was asked how he would respond to another sudden global financial crisis. He said: I would call Alan Greenspan and I would gather the facts. Wonderful! So would my mother. But she doesn't think she should be president. This is the essence of Mr. Bush's foreign policy. I would call Colin Powell. I would call Alan Greenspan. But what will he ask those advisers, and what happens if they disagree? For that Mr. Bush actually has to know something himself, and he appears to be a man with little intellectual curiosity. Mr. Bush seems to believe that by simply mentioning the name Colin Powell on foreign policy, he has a foreign policy. Had Mr. Bush listened to Mr. Powell on Kosovo, there would probably never have been a U.S. air war against Slobodan Milosevic and he would still be in power.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush's non-answers were a reflection of the shallow level of thinking about foreign policy generally in the Republican Party today. The fact is, the mainstream of the Republican Party, which for decades had the cold war and anti-Sovietism to guide it abroad, has simply gone brain dead since the cold war ended. It has lived off Clinton gaffes and a kind of drive-by foreign policy, in which Republicans drive by the White House, shout some insult at the Clinton team and drive on. The only original efforts to come to terms with the end of the cold war in the Republican Party have been the hyper-isolationist American nationalism of Pat Buchanan or the hyper-interventionist American nationalism articulated by William Kristol and Robert Kagan. Since Mr. Bush is not interested in either, it is not surprising that when pressed on foreign policy he falls back on name-dropping or on neo-cold-warism, such as his vow to ''rebuild military power,'' which ''starts with a billion-dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform.''

  The best you can say about Mr. Bush is that he has thought about the world and decided that it's still the 1980's, and therefore he plans to solve the problems of his father's era with his father's old advisers. The worst you can say is that deep into this campaign he still hasn't been able to master his briefing book on foreign policy and has evinced zero interest in thinking about the world afresh.

  Asked by reporters why Texas voters had re-elected Mr. Bush by a margin of 38 percentage points in 1998 if he had done such a bad job, Mr. Andrew laid the blame at the campaign run by his own party's candidate that year, Garry Mauro.

  Mr. Andrew also said it was ''fair game'' to attack Mr. Bush's verbal gaffes, which he said demonstrated that Mr. Bush ''simply does not have the experience we believe to be up to a presidential standard.''

Mr. Bush plans to attend a rally on Tuesday in Tennessee, Mr. Gore's home state, where a recent poll showed Mr. Bush leading. After the debate, Mr. Bush plans to travel to Pennsylvania and Michigan, while Mr. Gore plans stops in Milwaukee; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Detroit.

  Investigators are seeking a list of employees of the Bush campaign and Maverick Media, the campaign's advertising firm in Austin, Tex., who may have had access to the debate videotape and other internal briefing papers.

  In the current New Yorker, the magazine's Washington correspondent, Joe Klein, recounts an exchange from a 1992 campaign debate in which President Bush gave a fumbling answer to a question from the audience about how the national debt affected the ''economic problems of common people.'' Because the woman who asked the question was black, Mr. Bush noted that he had been to an A.M.E. church recently. Then he veered awkwardly to the subject of teenage pregnancies. When Bill Clinton's turn came, he stepped toward the woman and said, ''Tell me how it's affected you again.'' In Mr. Klein's view, this demonstration of Mr. Clinton's superior empathic ability was a pivotal moment in their competition. The observation touches on the perennial questions of what voters look for in the candidate debates and how they process what they see and hear.

  In our view, the history of televised debates since John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon met in 1960 demonstrates that mastery of facts is seldom decisive. Kennedy exaggerated the ''missile gap,'' and many contemporary observers famously thought that Nixon had won. In 1980, Jimmy Carter outpointed Ronald Reagan on substance. Last week Vice President Al Gore demonstrated a superior grasp of every aspect of domestic and foreign policy, but his presentation apparently set the stage for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to leap past him in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.

  The point, we hope, is not that intelligence does not matter, but rather that voters are not looking only for the smarter contestant or the more articulate or the more experienced, as the elder Mr. Bush was in 1992. The act of political bonding that must take place between a candidate and the voters is more complex than that. A certain level of intelligence is required as table stakes, so to speak. But the examples of Mr. Reagan and -- so far -- Governor Bush show that the public cannot be spooked by jokes and commentary to the effect that a given nominee may not be the brightest bulb on the tree.

  But no conceptual model fully covers the odd drama that will have its second act when Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have their next meeting tomorrow night. The vice president believes that the voters will succumb to a relentless reading of the facts on his inner teleprompter. The Texas governor thinks he can charm them into overlooking the manifest gaps in his knowledge and experience. In the end, the outcome could well be decided by some symbolic moment that inspires swing voters to a leap of faith.

  There were four generations of Gores and two generations of Gore in-laws at a party at the West Village loft of the artist JENNIFER BARTLETT the other night. By the time VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE and TIPPER GORE arrived from Florida, their daughter, KARENNA GORE SCHIFF, and her 15-month-old son, WYATT, had cruised through the living room, the terrace and the white-walled studio downstairs. Mrs. Schiff's husband, DREW, was there, too, as were his parents, DAVID and LISA SCHIFF; his sister ASHLEY; and his brother SCOTT. So was Mr. Gore's mother, PAULINE LAFON. It was her 88th birthday.

  Wyatt stole the show, rolling, clapping, gurgling and toddling his way through Mr. Gore's talk. Karenna Gore Schiff tried to distract him with a book. Wyatt would not be distracted, but the vice president was only too happy to let himself be.

  At one point, he turned to the little boy and said, ''Wyatt, would you like to show these people how you can walk backwards?''

  Florida, with three Republican seats in play, exemplifies most of the factors that have improved Democrats' chances. Few states have seen as much unexpected strength from the ticket of Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I.

So wealthy are the town's residents that Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman have been here recently for fund-raisers held by residents with deep pockets.

(Substituting food for sports metaphors suits the cozy Oprah-to-Regis circuit the candidates have been prancing through, but they are no improvement.)

  Though most commentators gave the edge to Vice President Al Gore, their wait-and-see caveats showed that they had learned something after the first debate, when pundits declared Mr. Gore the easy winner but Gov. George W. Bush gained in the polls. Yet the longer view points to a more fundamental question: why have debates diminished as major television events?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ratings were weak and the three debates failed to galvanize viewers because television itself has changed. Debates are now simply one part of a process that includes snap polls and focus groups, clips and interviews on morning shows the next day and pundits dissecting each camp's spin for days. Unless a candidate makes a catastrophic blunder (the flub-prone Mr. Bush might have but did not, everyone agreed) it is hard to argue for a debate's singular importance when viewers are bombarded with 24-hour cable news and candidates popping up in daytime, prime time and late night.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Over the next 24 hours, the debate's true significance revealed itself, as clips and interviews demonstrated the difference between watching in real time and seeing the debate shaped by repeated snippets. One clip instantly became the most frequently shown: Mr. Gore marching into Mr. Bush's space as if he were a bull ready to charge. In context, the sudden move reeked of contrivance, begging to be the clip of the day. Snipped out of context, the contrivance disappears and the visual image of strength takes over, as was intended.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The reverse happened with Mr. Bush's closing statement, when he raised his hand and mimed taking the presidential oath. The gesture was also clearly planned, an image meant to be lifted as a news bite. But each time it was replayed afterwards, Mr. Bush looked less presidential and more like a Star Trek character offering a greeting.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both candidates appeared on the ABC, CBS and NBC morning shows, in separate interviews taped soon after the debate. Each man reinforced the night's message in miniature.  Mr. Bush's code words were ''smaller government'' and Mr. Gore's ''fight for you.'' And on both CNN and ABC, Mr. Gore repeated what he called his Goldilocks interpretation of his debate performance. In the first he was too hot, in the second too cold and this time just right, he said. (It is a solid assessment but not original; after the second debate Ted Koppel had wondered how Mr. Gore could find a ''Goldilocks solution.'')
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Tuesday night's so-called Town Hall format was not really that. The candidates could not engage each other in conversation or address the questioners in the audience. Though Mr. Bush once chastised Mr. Gore for breaking the rules and speaking out of turn, it was when the candidates stepped outside the lines that the debate came to life.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet in the end, the format seemed less influential than the campaign strategists' orders. ''They came out fighting,'' as Bill Plante reported on the CBS ''Early Show'' the next morning. Mr. Gore's energetic display was meant to counter criticism that he had been too timid last time; Mr. Bush's demeanor, which several commentators called ''sleepy,'' seemed intended to play it safe and protect his slight lead.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The debates were lackluster, yet the Bush campaign's rejected proposals would have been worse. Imagine those meetings, moderated by Larry King (the king of softball questions) and Tim Russert (whose self-aggrandizement at the Hillary Clinton-Rick Lazio debate made him a performer rather than a moderator.) With Mr. King too cool, Mr. Russert too hot and Mr. Lehrer too lukewarm, where is Goldilocks when you need her?

  ''For Al Gore and me, this begins, if you will, by our faith,'' Mr. Lieberman told more than 1,000 people in a park here. ''If you believe in God, I think it's hard not to be an environmentalist, because you see the environment as the work of God.''

 </textdata>

  10-19-2000

 <textdata>
  With a lake as a backdrop, Mr. Lieberman spoke of a long list of environmental successes over the last generation and the role Mr. Gore has played in many of them. And he attacked Mr. Bush's environmental record in Texas, a regular theme of his speeches.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''When it comes to the environment and so much else, do we want to keep moving forward, or are we going to move backward?'' Mr. Lieberman asked. ''The record makes clear that George Bush and Dick Cheney will take America backwards.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He noted that Texas has the highest rate of toxic industrial air emissions of any state, the worst smog, and the third-highest rate of toxic water emissions. ''Given the chance to stand with people, families, or side with the polluters, Governor Bush has too often chosen to side with the polluters,'' Mr. Lieberman said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign has noted, in response to such criticism, that Texas' environmental problems predate the governor, and has argued that he is making headway on them. Environmental groups say that Mr. Bush's record on the issue is weak, and that he had little to do with the advances that Texas has made.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Lieberman's statement that belief in God should lead to environmentalism could be taken as a dig at Mr. Bush, who is avowedly religious, but who the senator and other Democrats say is no friend of the environment.

 </textdata>

  10-19-2000

  The former first lady's appearances today -- the first time that the Bush campaign had marketed her so aggressively -- dovetailed with a theme built around the middle initial in the Texas governor's name and an effort to bridge the gender gap.

  The governor's wife, Laura Bush, was side by side with her mother-in-law. Michelle Engler, the wife of Gov. John Engler of Michigan, played tour guide. Condoleezza Rice, the Bush campaign's foreign policy adviser, and Lynne V. Cheney, the wife of Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, were also part of a morning rally in Grand Rapids, then took off in their own bus for their own events before reconnecting with the Bushes in Southfield tonight.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And they returned time and again to the issue of integrity, until one of Barbara Bush's principal purposes came into focus: She was out here to remind voters of an administration without the stain of sexual scandal and to vouch for the character of the Republican presidential nominee.
 </textdata>

  Barbara and Laura Bush seemed to be enjoying it, but then they were also still basking in evident satisfaction over Tuesday night's debate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In an interview on their bus, they made clear that they thought that Vice President Al Gore had gone several paces too far, especially when he moved to within a few inches of Mr. Bush to stare him down.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I thought he literally was going to hit him,'' Barbara Bush said, adding that her husband, who had watched the television broadcast with her, had exclaimed, ''My God!''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They were not the only Bushes disturbed by Mr. Gore's stratagems. Laura Bush said that one of her twin 18-year-old daughters felt insulted by Mr. Gore's overt reference to his four children being at the debate. The Bush daughters, Barbara and Jenna, were not there.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They have always maintained a careful distance from the campaign, to the occasional dismay of their father. But Laura Bush said the couple's daughters had tuned in to every debate, and she said that when Jenna, who is more difficult to impress, gave her father a rave review, he cried.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Part of today's project was to talk about the softer side of the Texas governor, and the two Mrs. Bushes at times preferred that to policy.
 </textdata>

  After fielding several questions about abortion, Barbara Bush interjected, ''Is there any other subject you're interested in?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Barbara Bush hinted that her son is no ideologue on the matter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''George has said he's not going to have a litmus test,'' Mrs. Bush said, referring to her son. ''By coincidence, neither did his father.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  She went on to note that one of the two Supreme Court justices whom President Bush appointed, David H. Souter, turned out not to be so conservative after all.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Laura Bush said there were issues above and beyond abortion that women cared about, a point she emphasized at news conferences. In Lansing, she said that her husband's proposals would help women care for elderly parents in need.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Barbara Bush took mock offense, dramatically muttering, ''I'll never speak to her again!''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was a fleeting star turn on a day when, in some senses, the torch was being passed. Laura Bush got the featured speaking position and last word at joint rallies. She also conducted the news conferences.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Not that Barbara Bush lacked for adoration. People lined the hallways or streets she walked, dazzled to be near her. Mrs. Cheney introduced her in Grand Rapids as ''the most admired woman in the entire United States.'' Mrs. Engler introduced her in Lansing as ''the greatest first lady of the United States so far.''
 </textdata>

  Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush entered the three presidential debates with strikingly different objectives. For Mr. Bush, it was to persuade Americans that he was no slacker but a leader of presidential stature, a Washington outsider and a fresh alternative to the Democrats' tax-and-spend tradition.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For Mr. Gore, the goal was more ambitious: to score a knockout. He wanted to demonstrate that he towered over Mr. Bush in his command of the issues, that he was independent of the Clinton administration and that he was a fighter for the middle class. And he was determined that questions about his personality not distract voters from the issues.

  Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush entered the three presidential debates with strikingly different objectives. For Mr. Bush, it was to persuade Americans that he was no slacker but a leader of presidential stature, a Washington outsider and a fresh alternative to the Democrats' tax-and-spend tradition.

  After four-and-a-half hours before tens of millions of Americans, the initial reading of many strategists and academics is that Mr. Bush,  whose campaign tried mightily last month to limit his exposure in the debates, met more of his objectives.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Candidly, I think Bush gained the most of them just by surviving,'' said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist in Chicago who sometimes advises the Gore campaign. ''There was an unrealistic expectation among some Democrats that Gore would just grind him in the dust and that Bush would be tongue-tied and tearful.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even so, many analysts said Mr. Gore finally seemed to find his voice in the last debate, while Mr. Bush was more halting and less articulate than in earlier performances. It is no accident that Gore officials yesterday said they wanted to deliver videotapes of the third debate -- not the first or second -- to cable television stations around the country.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So now that the voters have seen the strengths and weaknesses of both candidates, this is the question as the campaign enters its final stretch: Will Americans come away from the three debates remembering Mr. Bush's more assured performances in the first two? Or will Mr. Gore's more sure-footed showing in the last debate take hold? Or will the events leave the voters more confused and unsure about their choice?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While the debates may have further muddled the contest, it is undeniable that Mr. Bush, for whatever reason, is in a better position than he was before the first debate in Boston three weeks ago. At that time, Mr. Bush was veering downward in the polls and drawing harsh publicity for pressing a debate proposal that seemed more favorable to him than the three prime-time debates planned by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It could be that by the time voter sentiment settles out, Mr. Gore may have gained from the last debate. But, for now, Mr. Bush can claim to have stemmed his dip in the polls -- and even inched ahead of Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush can declare the debates a success for his candidacy if for no other reason than that he showed he could go up against Mr. Gore -- who was regarded as a vaunted debater.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The big consideration in peoples' minds was, 'Is Bush up to the job?' And I think the debates basically answered that for a lot of people,'' said Morris P. Fiorina, a professor of political science at Stanford University. '' 'O.K., he may not be a genius, but he's O.K. on that dimension.' On the part of Gore, there were personality questions, and concerns, and the debate served to magnify those in the eyes of some.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  In the end, Mr. Gore found himself in the uncomfortable position of competing against his own performance, bowing at first to the initial critiques that he was too aggressive and then to the conclusion that he was too meek. Comparing himself to Goldilocks, Mr. Gore said yesterday on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' program: ''The first was too hot. The second was too cool. The third one was just right.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One reason that the debates, thus far, do not seem to have shaken the fundamental dynamics of an extraordinarily tight race is that neither Mr. Gore nor Mr. Bush was inclined to toss off one-liners or make any dramatic moves, probably out of fear that they could backfire.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I can't find any moments in these debates that are memorable,'' said Don Hewitt, the creator of ''60 Minutes'' who was a producer of the first televised presidential debates in 1960. ''We went in with the idea that Bush ain't the smartest kid in the class. And I don't think we knew that Gore was quite so boring. That may be the sum total of what happened in these debates.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The candidates, perhaps, could have differentiated themselves even more, perhaps, had they not passed up opportunities to be more bold. On Tuesday night, for example, Mr. Bush was handed a perfect opening after Mr. Gore, speaking of the disaffection with politics among young people, criticized Mr. Bush for opposing the McCain-Feingold campaign finance measure. The governor could have reminded viewers about the Buddhist temple fund-raiser and other questions about his opponent's fund-raising practices.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Gore passed up an opportunity to try to portray Mr. Bush as an extremist on guns. Rather than remind viewers that Mr. Bush backed legislation in Texas that would permit the carrying of concealed weapons in churches, hospitals and nursing homes, Mr. Gore presented himself as a defender of gun owners. ''None of my proposals,'' he said, ''would have an effect on hunters or sportsmen or people who use rifles.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''What you saw in Bush was a geniality and accessibility but not great mastery or strength, for that matter,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''In Gore, you saw strength and leadership and mastery, but not warmth.'' Though he hardly sounded enthusiastic, Mr. Axelrod is backing Mr. Gore, in part because warmth is low on his list of requirements.
 </textdata>

  Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist, insisted personality was important. ''My view is that the country did get to know both guys better and that helped Bush,'' he said.

  In their three debates, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore have waded deep into the thickets of tax policy, Social Security and the budget surplus. The numbers they have thrown around have often been confusing and conflicting -- and sometimes wrong.

  In the debate on Tuesday, Mr. Gore used the audience to illustrate his argument that Mr. Bush's tax plan favors the rich.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If all 130 audience members were ''dead on in the middle of the middle class,'' he said, their combined tax cuts under the Bush plan would be less than the cut enjoyed by ''just one member'' of the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers, which he defined as people making more than $330,000 a year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In assessing the Bush plan, the Gore campaign relies on an analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal-leaning research group that uses a well-respected computer model. The group defined the top one percent as as people who make $319,000 or more, with the average being $915,000. The average annual tax cut for members of that group under the Bush plan would be $46,072, Citizens for Tax Justice said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There are a number of credible definitions of middle class. In this case the Gore campaign relied on one at the low end of the spectrum -- a range of $24,400 to $39,300 per household, with an average of $31,000, which Citizens for Tax Justice described as the middle 20 percent of incomes for tax purposes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The average tax cut for that group would be $453 under the Bush plan, the group said. Multiplied times 130, the total is $58,890 -- $12,818 more than the average tax cut for the top one percent. (The vice president's example would have worked only if there were no more than 101 people in the audience.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore seemed to imply in the debate that his assertion applied to anyone making more than $330,000 a year. Asked to explain Mr. Gore's statement, campaign aides said he had in mind someone making $1 million a year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even at that income level, the Gore campaign had to compare apples and oranges to make the math work. It used the Citizens for Tax Justice figures for the middle income tax cut, but estimated the tax cut for a $1 million earner by combining figures from The Wall Street Journal's online tax calculator and Citizens for Tax Justice.
 </textdata>

  In the second presidential debate last week, Mr. Bush said that ''most of the tax reductions'' in his plan would ''go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In assessing his plan's effect on different income groups, Mr. Bush relies on an analysis by the nonpartisan staff of Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The analysis shows that in 2005, after the Bush plan is fully phased in, it would reduce taxes on households making $200,000 or more by $32.2 billion, or 26.8 percent of the total tax cut in that year of $120.1 billion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Moreover, the analysis does not consider Mr. Bush's proposal to repeal the federal estate tax. Economists differ about how much of the benefits of an estate tax repeal would go to the wealthy, but there is no disagreement that they would reap most of the benefit.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has said in all the debates that his plan would require people at upper-income levels to pay a greater share of federal income taxes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Joint Committee on Taxation's analysis shows that households making $200,000 or more in 2005 would pay 27.4 percent of total federal income taxes under Mr. Bush's plan, just as they do now. Households making $100,000 or more would see their share of the total income tax bill tick up to 25.2 percent, from 25.1 percent under current law. The calculations do not consider the effects of the estate tax, which would benefit people at upper-income levels the most.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  In the debate on Tuesday, Mr. Gore said that Mr. Bush intended to take $1 trillion out of the Social Security trust fund over the next decade to establish private investment accounts within the retirement system. The vice president said that in doing so, Mr. Bush had promised the same money twice -- once for the private accounts and once to pay benefits to retirees -- and that he would have to break one of those promises.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was right to say that Mr. Bush's Social Security plan will require $1 trillion to get started, and the governor acknowledged as much. Mr. Gore was also right that the money would come out of Social Security payroll taxes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Social Security is currently taking in more money from payroll taxes than it needs to pay in benefits to current retirees. That surplus is projected at nearly $2.4 trillion over the next decade, and the system will probably run surpluses until around 2015, when it will begin running huge deficits. Mr. Bush's $1 trillion would come from the Social Security surplus.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has a point in this sense: It is possible to think of debt reduction as a way of saving for the day when Social Security will need to call on general tax revenues to help pay for benefits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To the extent that Mr. Bush's plan would leave less money for debt reduction, the government might find it harder, or at least more expensive, to come up with the money needed for Social Security benefits in the long run.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said that under Mr. Bush's proposal, Social Security would be bankrupt in 20 years. If nothing is done, Social Security will have run through its trust fund -- promises by the government to pay back to itself the Social Security surpluses that over the years have gone to government spending and tax cuts -- by 2037. Using $1 trillion of the surplus for private accounts would move that date up by around 15 years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Starting in the first debate, Mr. Bush said Mr. Gore was a big spender -- bigger than any of the three previous Democratic presidential candidates -- whose proposals would bust the budget. And he said electing Mr. Gore would mean the return of big government.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's budget has less of a buffer than Mr. Gore's does. By Mr. Bush's own accounting, his budget would use all but $265 billion of the surplus, and that is without paying for some of his campaign promises, like an expanded national missile defense system. Mr. Gore says he would set aside $660 billion of the surplus for a reserve fund and higher levels of debt reduction.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said Mr. Gore is proposing three times as much spending as President Clinton did when he was running in 1992.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That assertion rests on an analysis by a conservative research group, the National Taxpayers Union, which concluded that Mr. Gore's spending would total $2.9 trillion in the next decade. The Gore campaign says it would spend a little over $1 trillion and offer tax breaks of less than $500 billion. Mr. Clinton's 1992 proposals were made a time of record budget deficits; Mr. Gore's were made at a time of large and growing surpluses.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said he had helped slim down the federal bureaucracy through his work on the administration's Reinventing Government initiative. Since 1992, the civilian government work force has fallen by 400,000 people, to 1.82 million, although nearly three-quarters of the reduction has been the Pentagon.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some analysts measure the size of government by looking at total spending relative to the size of the economy. By that measure, government outlays have declined steadily in recent years, to 18.7 percent of gross domestic product this year. Mr. Gore said his plan would push that figure down to 17 percent by 2008.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000

 <textdata>
  In the first debate, Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush is refusing to treat surplus Medicare revenues in the same way that the two parties have agreed to treat the surpluses in Social Security -- by putting them in a ''lockbox,'' where they would be unavailable to either party for new spending or tax cuts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was largely correct.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president has proposed that the entire Medicare surplus of $360 billion over the next decade go to debt reduction. Mr. Bush needs that same money in his budget to pay for his $1.3 trillion tax cut and his spending initiatives. Without the Medicare surplus, Mr. Bush's budget would be in the red by $95 billion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There is a loophole available to Mr. Bush. Most lockbox proposals allow the money to be used for Medicare reform, and Mr. Bush has nearly $200 billion in his budget for Medicare-related proposals, including the establishment of a prescription drug benefit for retirees.

  About 37.7 million people saw the debate on the major broadcast and cable news networks, Nielsen reported. The Oct. 11 meeting between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush was watched by 37.5 million people, the second-smallest audience on record for a televised presidential debate. Their first debate, on Oct. 3, was watched by at least 46.6 million people, Nielsen said.

  THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VIEWERS  Correction:  October 20, 2000, Friday  A headline yesterday about television ratings for the three debates between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore misstated viewership for the last one, on Tuesday. It drew more viewers than the Oct. 11 debate, but not more than the one on Oct. 3.

  A headline yesterday about television ratings for the three debates between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore misstated viewership for the last one, on Tuesday. It drew more viewers than the Oct. 11 debate, but not more than the one on Oct. 3.

  The plan is based on the premise that Mr. Gore's debate performance was unusually strong and provided the vice president ammunition both to make the case for himself as the best steward of the nation's economy and to make the case against Gov. George W. Bush as someone who would bankrupt Social Security and give most tax cuts to the rich.
 </textdata>

  The campaign began broadcasting three new television commercials today that underscored these themes. The commercials are running in 12 swing states and will be reinforced by three major speeches in the next few days -- an economic speech on Thursday in New York and speeches on Saturday in New Orleans and on Sunday in Dallas about his priorities and how they reflect his values. Except for a brief stop on Saturday in Washington to watch his son play football, Mr. Gore is expected to be on the road continuously until Election Day, Nov. 7.

  Virtually crowing about Mr. Gore's performance, Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager, said: ''Last night allayed a lot of concerns.'' He said that the debate had fortified Gore representatives today as they met with Democrats on Capitol Hill who had been worried about Mr. Gore's previously weak  debates and sagging poll numbers.
 </textdata>

  Gore officials contend that Mr. Bush made two major blunders in the debate. The governor agreed that ''of course'' most of his tax cut would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, because, as Mr. Bush said, they are the ones who pay the most taxes. And he said that his plan to privatize part of Social Security would cost $1 trillion, money that would come from the Social Security trust fund -- an admission that Mr. Gore said today essentially conceded that Mr. Bush would bankrupt Social Security in 23 years, 14 years sooner than was now projected.

 <textdata>
  ''Social Security is on the ballot this fall,'' Mr. Gore told about 200 people in Des Moines. As if speaking to Mr. Bush, he added: ''Don't promise it away. Don't use fuzzy math. You promise the same trillion to two different groups. That's fuzzy math. You want to talk about fuzzy math, that's plenty fuzzy.'' Mr. Bush had accused Mr. Gore in the first debate of using ''fuzzy math.''

  At an outdoor rally here tonight,  Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of being in the pocket of the big drug companies. ''He does what they want,'' Mr. Gore roared to the crowd of thousands. ''That's just the hard truth.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore was well aware that he also had to battle negative impressions that Mr. Bush sought to raise about him during the debate --  one, that Mr. Gore was an advocate of big government and, two, that he did not understand that younger entrepreneurial-minded voters wanted to invest part of their Social Security taxes in the stock market.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore sought to reassure his audience that he did not want to expand government. ''I'll make our government smaller and smarter,'' he pledged. He said he would do this in part by putting many government services online. ''I want create a federal government where you never have to stand in line because you can get it online.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  On the subject of investing Social Security, Nancy Nichols, an older voter in Des Moines, said she was concerned that Mr. Gore had not made his position plain enough. She said that a young Republican had told her that in the time that he had paid $9,000 into Social Security, he had also invested $9,000 in stocks -- and that those stocks were now worth $18,000. ''Under your plan, they still would have that opportunity if they were willing to save, but I don't think that part of your plan or that message has gotten across,'' Ms. Nichols told the vice president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore mocked the idea of older people investing their Social Security in the stock market. He gestured to Winnie Skinner, 79, a Des Moines resident whom he made famous last month because she recycled aluminum cans for extra money, who was sitting in today's audience, and said, ''So, are you ready to get on the Internet and be a day-trader, Winnie?''

  In the final debate, George W. Bush defended capital punishment solely on the ground that it deters killings, and Al Gore agreed that the death penalty is a deterrent to potential murderers (transcript, Oct. 18). The evidence that the death penalty deters crime is on the whole negative and at best (to those who support the deterrence rationale) inconclusive.

  During the debate George W. Bush consistently called women -- and a black man -- by their first names. When answering a white man, however, he used ''sir.''

  After all, Mr. Bush's father, President George Bush, spent most of his adult life thriving on Washington jobs in the Central Intelligence Agency, the Republican National Committee, an ambassadorship to China, the vice presidency and Congress.

  And George W. Bush's vice-presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, has spent many years in Washington as a Bush cabinet member and a congressman, and Mr. Bush's possible nominee to be secretary of state, Gen. Colin L. Powell, is certainly a Washington insider.
 </textdata>

  ''Did you see -- I finally got him to say he's going to vote for Al Gore,'' Mr. Mattingly said later in an interview. ''He's on the Clinton-Gore team, and Hillary Clinton's team, and he's also got Ted Kennedy on his team. Not me, I'm on the George Bush team, I'm on the Trent Lott team.''

  It was true; Mr. Miller, a popular former governor, had indeed pledged himself to Mr. Gore when pinned down by Mr. Mattingly. Not because he agreed with Mr. Gore on the issues, he quickly made clear, but only because Mr. Gore had helped Georgia in natural disasters and had helped bring the 1996 Olympics to Atlanta.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In other words, it was not because Mr. Gore and Mr. Miller both happen to be Democrats. The word ''Democrat'' is not uttered by Mr. Miller on the campaign trail, and appears nowhere on his campaign Web site. Technically, this is because the race to replace Senator Paul Coverdell, who died in July, is nonpartisan, with all seven candidates appearing on the Nov. 7 ballot without party affiliation. (There will be a Nov. 28 runoff between the top two candidates if no one gets more than 50 percent of the votes.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The unusual formula seems to be working, and Mr. Miller has been well ahead in the same polls that show Mr. Gore trailing. A recent statewide telephone poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed Mr. Miller at 59 percent and Mr. Mattingly at 31 percent, with a margin of sampling error of four  percentage points. The same poll showed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas leading Mr. Gore by 16 points in the state.

  Indicative of the political sensitivity of the issue, the campaign of Vice President Al Gore had no immediate comment on today's vote, and his rival, Governor George W. Bush, condemned the Senate action. ''Governor Bush opposes changing the sanctions against Cuba until Fidel Castro or the Cuban government allow free elections, free speech and freedom for political prisoners,'' said Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.

  Mr. Gore demonstrated his aggressiveness in each encounter. He is unable to follow rules or give the other person respect. If he is in the White House, he will continue this behavior with Republicans and any Democrats who disagree with him. We thought we had it bad when President Clinton and Newt Gingrich went head to head, but with Al Gore it would be total gridlock.

  What accomplishments can Vice President Al Gore point to in boosting his claim of foreign policy experience (front page, Oct. 18)? Well, we've just heard that Mr. Gore and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister, signed a secret agreement in 1995 regarding Russian arms sales to Iran whose details were never disclosed to Congress and which apparently undercut a 1992 United States law. I suppose that's experience. Some kinds of experience, though, we just don't need.

  To the vast army of undecideds, this debate was conducted in body language. Gore bestrode the stage like a Colossus, expressing confidence in a John Wayne swagger, once almost butting his puffed-out chest against Bush in a Lazio-like space invasion. When not speaking, the vice president stood stiffly at attention, feet together, hands rigidly at his sides, to remind us visually of his service in Vietnam.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Playing to an electorate that supposedly dislikes finger-pointing, Gore repeatedly pointed an accusing finger at Bush and all around the room. In this way he goaded and tried to rattle Bush, who airily dismissed these devices as ''an old high school debating trick.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush, in contrast, often struck a Milquetoast pose, fingers intertwined as if in prayer, rocking from side to side as if his feet hurt. He looked plaintively to the referee to enforce the rules against direct elbowing in the clinches, while Gore -- having shed the ill-fitting sheep's clothing of the previous meeting -- resumed his lupine lecturing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Not until the second half did Bush rouse himself to remind viewers that cynicism and apathy would be overcome when the nation elected ''somebody who'll tell the truth.'' He got in a good lick about abolishing the unpopular death tax. He used a prepared line to underscore his big-spender charge -- ''If this were a spending contest, I'd come in second'' -- and closed strongly by reciting the promise that most irritates die-hard Clintonites: ''to uphold the dignity and honor of the office.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Did Gore succeed in showing sharp difference between policies, so necessary to getting out his vote? Yes; to arrest the seeming slide toward Bush, he returned to the populism of the Democratic convention, using ''fight'' as his keyword, holding himself out as the class warrior out to soak the rich and to drive big oil and the big drug companies to the wall.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in so doing, Gore displayed the difference between candidates in personality. He came on strong; he knew it all; he slid around questions to touch all the hot buttons (except, unaccountably, abortion and Supreme Court nominations). ABC's Cokie Roberts noted ''the cringe factor'': the negative reaction of many women to the ferocity of the policy wonk.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This final debate was less about positions (which will change as surpluses vanish) than impressions. Gore, playing catch-up, was determined to dominate the stage and thereby rally his dispirited troops; Bush, playing not to lose, was out to be so non-threatening as to narrow the gender gap.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For once, the personas reflect the persons; the images are close to the realities; ''the style is the man himself.'' Gore is truly tough-minded, stupefyingly experienced and unabashedly divisive, while Bush is truly amiable and not all that deep and all too eager to unify.

  Turned off by Al Gore's performance in the first two debates, a fair number of voters began moving toward Mr. Bush, making excuses and weird rationalizations along the way. Some argued that if Mr. Bush were to become president and the country found itself in a tight spot, he'd have plenty of experienced people available to bail him out -- his dad; his vice president, Dick Cheney; his secretary of state, Colin Powell, etc.

 <textdata>
  At the debate Tuesday night, Al Gore was the best he's been since his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention. He was knowledgeable and comfortable discussing a wide range of complex issues, including health care, Social Security and tax cuts. You can agree or disagree with his position on any issue, but you cannot argue that Mr. Gore does not understand the issue. With Mr. Bush, you're never quite sure.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  The tone of the debate was set early. Mr. Gore was much better prepared than Mr. Bush to discuss a so-called patients' bill of rights. ''Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by H.M.O.'s and insurance companies,'' said Mr. Gore. ''That is unacceptable.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said he, too, supports a patients' bill of rights. But though he was asked twice if he supported the Dingell-Norwood bill, he never answered. Instead, he scoffed at the whole governmental process, saying, ''There's this kind of Washington D.C. focus -- well, it's in this committee, or it's got this sponsor.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Time and again during the debate Mr. Bush appeared baffled by the specifics of one issue or another. During a discussion of affirmative action, Mr. Gore asked, ''Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?''

  Mr. Gore said, quietly and devastatingly, ''I think that speaks for itself.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  The answer was bizarre. It meandered this way and that until it lost any semblance of coherence. Mr. Bush said everyone would get tax relief under his plan. He went on to say, ''I think also what you need to think about is not the immediate but what about Medicare?'' He said, ''You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.'' He talked about Medicare people being stuck in a time warp. He said, ''You're going to live in a peaceful world.'' He said, ''You'll be in a world, hopefully, that's more educated, so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood, seeing an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic.'' And so on.

  What an exquisite dilemma for a man who always wants things both ways! He needs his partner to excel so that Al can defeat W. and secure Mr. Clinton's legacy. But if Mr. Gore falls short, Mr. Clinton can comfort himself with the belief that ''if only I were out there, the election would be over. I'm still the best. If you find a turtle on a fencepost, it didn't get there by accident.''

  Mr. Clinton, some close to him say, is bewildered and hurt by the way Mr. Gore keeps erasing him from his  White House photo album. The president thinks Mr. Gore should run as his vice president, bragging on their record of economic growth, welfare reform and fiscal (if not personal) discipline.

  In a 1996 debate with Bob Dole, Mr. Clinton used sidling and staring to intimidate his rival. Mr. Gore attempted the same maneuver Tuesday. Lithe as a lawn mower, subtle as a subpoena, Alpha Al clomped right up beside Mr. Bush, who rewarded him with a disdainful double take that brought chuckles from the crowd. Mr. Gore kept right on striding up to the crowd, like an Olympic diver about to do a three-and-a-half-somersault pike.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's erratic and sometimes arrogant debate demeanor, which has caused some Gore focus groups to violently turn on the Democratic nominee, has surely confirmed Mr. Clinton's belief, which he once confided to a friend, that Al would have been happier in academia.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore cannot even bring himself to use the word ''Clinton.'' In the debate, he was boasting of his role in planning ''the president's'' summit meeting in the Mideast. He caught himself using the ''P'' word and you could practically hear the klaxon go off as he switched to praising the great job of ''our country's team.''

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000

 <textdata>
  ''He's of the government,'' Mr. Bush thundered. ''He's for the government. He loves Washington, D.C.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And seeking to sway voters who consider prosperity an argument for  Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush said his opponent would actually endanger the good times.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush engaged in a delicate balancing act as he barnstormed across a state that voted twice for President Clinton but is considered up for grabs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm here to let you know I'm going to work my heart out all the way to the finish,'' Mr. Bush told an airport rally. ''But I want your help. This is going to be a close election. Nobody should take anything for granted. It's going to be down to the wire, which means hard work and grass-roots people are going to make a big difference.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He struck the same note at the E. O. Johnson Company. ''One of the reasons I've come is to ask you to tell your independents and Democrats to be open-minded,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Wisconsin's governor, Tommy G. Thompson, was far more pointed as he introduced Mr. Bush at a packed rally here in the afternoon. He said that Mr. Bush had been well raised by his parents but that Mr. Gore needed to learn the lessons taught by Robert Fulghum in his book ''All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Don't interrupt people when they speak,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''He said, Don't be a bully. He said, Don't interrupt people. Come November,  We should send Al Gore back to kindergarten.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Bush scoffed at Mr. Gore's statement in Tuesday's debate that the vice president did not stand for big government. ''Now there's a man whose prone to exaggeration.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was also seeking to frame the final days of the race as a choice between economic visions.  Tad Devine, a senior Gore strategist, seized on several of Mr. Bush's answers in Tuesday night's debate to argue that Mr. Bush ''demonstrated conclusively that he wanted to fight for the wealthy, not the rest of society.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Devine pointed to Mr. Bush's reply when the moderator, Jim Lehrer, asked him to respond to Mr. Gore's accusation that Mr. Bush's tax cut would mainly benefit the top 1 percent of wealthiest Americans. (Mr. Bush said, ''Of course it does.'') Mr. Devine also pointed to Mr. Bush's description of the word ''insurance'' as ''a Washington term.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush fired back today against accusations that he favors the well-to-do. ''That's the kind of language that's divisive,'' he said. ''It's the kind of language that pits one group  of people against another. It's called class warfare. That's the kind of language that will make it hard to get something done in Washington, D.C. America doesn't want class warfare. ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides declared themselves pleased with the outcome of the three presidential debates. ''I think we exceeded all expectations,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the governor's communications director. ''The debate phase was clearly a turning point. We have come out of the debate phase with the trend clearly in our direction.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Arguing that he would be the better steward of prosperity, Mr. Bush said there were warning signs of a recession on the horizon. He called his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut an ''insurance policy against an economic slowdown.''

  ''I think they're very useful tools for humanizing stories that journalists want to cover,'' said one polling expert, Michael Traugott, a political science professor at the University of Michigan who has conducted focus groups for the news media.

  From the video chronicle of game-show combatants on a deserted island off Malaysia to the public relations tactics of George W. Bush and Al Gore, ''real people'' is the mantra of the moment, and producers and editors are in businesses obsessed with trends. Their professions have also long sought better and better methods of tracking the vox populi, and with polls showing that this presidential election could be the tightest in 40 years, there is added pressure and interest in identifying and talking to voters who have yet to make up their minds.

  Mr. Blitzer's first on-air question was, ''Tell me who you think won the debate.'' When the anchor mentioned Mr. Gore, 14 hands went up; 3 went up for Mr. Bush. Mr. Blitzer did not mention the count, and today Mr. Traugott, the Michigan professor, applauded the absence of any such tally on the air. Asking for a show of hands, Mr. Traugott said, was an acceptable way to stimulate discussion. The polling expert's verdict:  ''I'd say they were clean last night.''

  Almost without exception, a group of 20-odd voters in southeastern Michigan, who gathered at the request of The New York Times at Wallace House, just off the campus of the University of Michigan, said after watching the 90-minute television encounter between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Tuesday evening that their voting plans were unchanged.

  When Mr. Bush refused to give a yes-or-no answer to the question of whether he supports affirmative action, a lot of groans and a few hisses  resounded through the room.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Marisa Buchanan, 21, a senior at the University of Michigan, said that she had been more impressed by Mr. Bush, even though she tended to agree with the vice president on issues. She said that she found Mr. Gore ''a caricature of himself'' whose oratory was ''overdone, even for politics.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Nevertheless, Ms. Buchanan continued: ''I found myself leaning towards Bush at the end, although I must admit I still don't like him. I've always had the impression that he says what other people tell him to say. But he seemed tonight to mean things, like when he defended his position on the death penalty. He appeared very sincere.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''Al Gore's tedious,'' Mr. Hadesh said. ''He makes me twitch. It's hard for me to listen to him. But when George Bush says he doesn't trust Washington, it means nothing. It's not nearly enough to persuade me to vote for him.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another in the group said he thought that when Mr. Gore walked over to Mr. Bush while the latter was speaking, he briefly feared that the vice president ''was going to smack him.'' And Norman J. Rotter, a neurosurgeon who lives in Oakland County, one of the pivotal suburban areas north of Detroit, said he worried that Mr. Gore was ''too arrogant'' to represent the United States effectively in negotiations with other countries, especially poor ones.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Dick Siegel, a singer and songwriter, said he was considering voting for Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, ''but not if it would elect Bush.''  He was opposed ''intellectually and spiritually,'' he said, to the Texan's positions and what he termed his ''good old boy'' personality. But he added, he found Mr. Gore ''a strange man,'' which bothered him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Gore's inherently a bully,'' said Richard Boothman, 45, a lawyer and a Republican. ''He's in your face, all the time. Bush had a theme: that he knew how to build coalitions between parties, and he'd done it in Texas.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Simone D. Lightfoot, the Detroit coordinator for the N.A.A.C.P. National Voter Fund, said that as a veteran of the Persian Gulf war, she found Mr. Bush's criticisms of American military preparedness convincing. But she said she could not join in the complaints about Mr. Gore's manner. She explained: ''I prefer a leader who's aggressive and outspoken, so I thought Gore did very well.  Gore had the details. Bush said what he wanted, Gore how he'd get there.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Rebecca Blank, 45, the dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at Michigan, took strong exception to the other part of Mr. Boothman's comment. An economist and a Democrat, she said that she thought Mr. Bush's coalition theme completely fallacious.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''That was the area in which Mr. Bush had the least credibility,'' she said, ''that he could go to Washington and make it work. I don't see any evidence at all -- he gave none -- that Texas prepared him to deal with Congress.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000

  Mr. Gore had other defenders.  Nancy Reame, 53, a professor of nursing, said that he offered ''more substantive strategies'' on education and other major matters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I listened for specifics from Bush, but I didn't hear them,'' she said.  ''All I heard were generalities. Neither of them paid a lot of attention to women's issues like abortion and hand guns. Bush talked a lot about taking the government out of our lives, but not as far as abortion is concerned.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Her husband, Ron, 54, chairman of New Horizons Graphic Computer Learning, much preferred Mr. Bush's demeanor, describing him as more courteous.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''But Gore's statements were clearer,'' Mr. Reame, a Republican, said. ''Gore was on target all evening. Bush, no. Bush tired at the end and seemed to run out of material. He was falling apart, not answering questions, sometimes not even following them well.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mike Spahn, 21, the editor of The Michigan Daily, a student newspaper, said Mr. Bush had failed to answer questions and had failed to reply effectively to Mr. Gore's accusations, like the vice president's insistence that the Bush tax plan favored the richest 1 percent of Americans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Whereas Mr. Bush ''deflected all the tough questions,'' said Peter Eckstein, a retired economist, Mr. Gore ''showed his experience during the last eight years and effectively laid out what this administration has accomplished.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Gore proved to us all tonight that he learned his lessons from Clinton,'' he said. ''Just like Clinton, he disregarded the rules -- interrupting, asking questions when he wasn't supposed to, all that. In this country we're taught that everyone plays by the same rules, but these people don't do it.''

  In the face of growing efforts by the Democratic Party and its allies to deflate his support, Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president, criticized Vice President Al Gore today more sharply than ever before, accusing him of repeatedly breaking promises to clean up the environment, help the poor and reform the federal government.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Al Gore is suffering from election-year delusion if he thinks his record on the environment is anything to be proud of,'' Mr. Nader said at a packed news conference at the National Press Club. ''He should be held accountable by voters for eight years of principles betrayed and promises broken.''

  Today, for example, officials with the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League said the group would begin running television commercials in Portland, Ore., Minneapolis and Madison, Wis., late this week urging people who support abortion rights not to vote for Mr. Nader, on the premise that the election of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas  would lead to a Supreme Court that would overturn those rights.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For that reason, a number of prominent labor unions and interest groups, including Naral, the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club and the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization, have recently begun major campaigns to convince liberal voters that a vote for Mr. Nader is effectively a vote for Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Naral's new commercial, for instance, warns that Mr. Bush's goal is ''ending legal abortion'' and concludes, ''Before voting Nader, consider the risk.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Most of those organizations have said liberals should vote for Mr. Gore because Bush appointments to the Supreme Court could pose a threat to causes like abortion rights. But today, Mr. Nader shrugged off that argument, asserting that some Democratic nominees to the court have compiled conservative voting records.
 </textdata>

  Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, said: ''Voters who are informed about the issues know that big things are at stake in this election, like a woman's right to choose. The voters who care about these issues know that the differences between Al Gore and George Bush are like night and day.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Only Al Gore can beat Al Gore,'' Mr. Nader said. ''And he's been doing a pretty good job of that. Up against one of the most bumbling, corporate-indentured, horrible- record Republican candidates, George W. Bush, and he's still in a neck-and-neck race.''
 </textdata>

  ''In the addresses and debates by George W. Bush and Al Gore, there are lots of references to the middle class -- the shrinking middle class, but they don't mention that it's shrinking. There is very little reference to the working poor in this country. Forty-seven million full-time American workers in this country are making less than $10 an hour, many of them at the federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, and the rest not much more.

  The lack of affordable housing, the number of children who go to bed hungry every night and the more than 32 million Americans who live in poverty put the lie to the Gore-Lieberman claim of broad-based prosperity under the current administration's regime. Much like their Republican counterparts, Gore and Lieberman have great faith in the discredited concept of trickle-down economics.

  The statewide poll of 637 registered voters taken by telephone Sunday through Tuesday found that Mr. Bush is seen as more likely than his opponent to lower taxes. But a large number of Florida voters doubted that either candidate would really cut taxes. And when the voters were asked what should be done with the federal budget surplus, cutting taxes lagged way behind strengthening Social Security and Medicare.

  When Mr. Bush embarked on his presidential campaign, he and his staff had high hopes of winning Florida, in part because his brother Jeb is a popular governor here. But through the summer, as Mr. Bush concentrated his time and advertising money on swing states in the Midwest, Mr. Gore made steady gains here with his emphasis on a broad plan for prescription drug coverage and his selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as a running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The poll also found that Mr. Bush was getting less of a lift than he had hoped from his brother.

  Among registered voters in Florida, the poll found Mr. Gore favored by 44 percent, Mr. Bush by 42 percent, Ralph Nader by 3 percent and Patrick J. Buchanan by 1 percent. Among those expected to vote, Mr. Gore was ahead of Mr. Bush 46 percent to 42 percent, with 3 percent for Mr. Nader and 1 percent for Mr. Buchanan.
 </textdata>

  Recognizing the closeness of the race here, Mr. Bush has visited Florida about once a week since Labor Day and was here again today, campaigning with Senator John McCain of Arizona and Jeb Bush.

  The poll found that among likely voters in Florida 65 and over, Mr. Gore had a 10-point advantage. The two candidates are running basically even among likely voters who are under 65.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore advantage among voters who think of themselves as independents was also striking. Nationally, polls show, Mr. Bush is about 10 points ahead among voters without strong party affiliation, but in Florida, Mr. Gore is more than 10 points ahead.

  In 1992, President George Bush carried Florida. In 1996, Mr. Clinton won the state. The Republican candidate got essentially the same proportion of the vote, 41 percent for Mr. Bush in 1992 and 42 percent for Bob Dole in 1996. But Mr. Clinton's vote rose to 48 percent in 1996 from 39 percent in 1992. Mr. Clinton was able to accomplish that because he picked up the biggest share of the Perot vote, which was 20 percent in 1992 but only 9 percent in 1996.

  Not surprisingly, the poll found Mr. Gore strongest on the Gold Coast, the area along the southeastern shore from Miami north to Palm Beach. Many people in this area moved from the Northeast, especially from New York and New Jersey, and brought their liberal, Democratic politics with them. Democrats nearly always do well there.
 </textdata>

  The voters are closely divided between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area, and Mr. Bush has a good lead in the rest of the state, the poll indicated.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One source of Mr. Gore's strength is that a solid majority of voters said he could be expected to make health care affordable, protect the environment and reduce the price of prescription medicine. A majority of voters said Mr. Bush was not likely to accomplish each of these.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both candidates are viewed favorably by most Florida voters. What sets Mr. Bush apart from many other Republicans is that he is seen by as large a majority of voters as Mr. Gore as being someone who cares about the needs and problems of people like themselves.

  As in the majors, C.B.A. teams play 162 games per season. Over time, there have been 41 teams and nearly 2,500 players. The highest single-season batting average, .497, is held by Warren G. Harding of the Washington Presidents. The Presidents' players tend to stay on its roster for years, although President Clinton spent last season on the ''morally disabled'' list. At present, Al Gore and George W. Bush are neck and neck in a home-run derby that will earn the winner a lineup spot in 2001.

  Mr. Bush has a similar problem. He's fine as long as he's shaking hands and smiling and hugging little children. He's got personality. But something weird happens when he puts aside his programmed responses and starts speaking extemporaneously.

  Mr. Gore's personality problems and voter concern over Mr. Bush's readiness to assume the presidency have muted enthusiasm for both men and drawn attention away from issues that might otherwise have been decisive.

  A Page 1 article in Monday's Times said: ''Even after absorbing three debates and months of campaigning, American voters are thoroughly ambivalent about their choices for president, still vexed by doubts about Vice President Al Gore's sincerity and Gov. George W. Bush's preparedness for the White House, the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll shows.''
 </textdata>

  That sigh of relief you just heard is coming from the Gore people. The vice president's personality has gotten in the way of his message throughout the campaign. Even at the Democratic convention, where it was generally agreed that Mr. Gore delivered a credible acceptance speech, the strongest case for continuing the policies of the Clinton administration was made by the president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Referring to his budget proposal in the first year of his first administration, Bill Clinton told the convention's roaring delegates: ''It passed by a single vote in both houses. In a deadlocked Senate, Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote. Now, not a single Republican supported it. . . . Their leaders said our plan would increase the deficit, kill jobs, and give us a one-way ticket to a recession. Time has not been kind to their predictions.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Clinton is itching to take that message to the American people one more time. But polls have tended to show that Bill Clinton campaigning full-blast for Al Gore would turn off substantially more voters than he would turn on. So the big dog remains leashed.
 </textdata>

  The trends to watch over the next several days are whether Al Gore can keep the personality questions behind him and get a bounce from hammering home the differences between him and Mr. Bush on specific issues, and whether Mr. Bush, in the pressurized finale of a presidential campaign, can avoid being undermined by voter unease over whether he is ready for the White House.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But what if Powell prefers Health and Human Services, where his current interest lies? Then the Bush SecState would probably be Condoleezza Rice, now provost at Stanford. If Bush thought Rice better suited to be his national security adviser, he might pick Senator Richard Lugar. Meanwhile, Gore would back up Holbrooke at State with his national security adviser, Leon Fuerth.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000

 <textdata>
  At Defense, President Gore might well sound out the Republican John McCain; he would probably decline, looking toward a presidential race in 2004. Gore might then turn to Representative John Murtha of Pennsylvania or former Senator Sam Nunn. President Bush might also choose Nunn, a Democrat, or turn to Paul Wolfowitz or Paul O'Neil.
 </textdata>

  If Gore chose the former Texas governor Ann Richards for H.H.S., he could then break Clinton tradition and choose a male attorney general: Jack (Tell 'Em Nuthin') Quinn, a former White House counsel. George W.'s first choice to head Bush Justice would be John Danforth, the former Missouri senator.

  Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, hoping to be a Gore holdover, may think his competition is the current Fannie Mae chief, James Johnson. But a more intriguing Gore choice would be Bill Bradley, who demonstrated loyalty and has Senate Finance credentials. For Treasury in a Bush administration, PaineWebber's Don Marron has the inside track, though Representative Jennifer Dunn of Washington is in the running. Gore's chief economic adviser would be Alan Blinder, and Bush's is Lawrence Lindsey; both are former Federal Reservists.
 </textdata>

  At Agriculture, Gore could fend off a possible conservative Democratic  revolt in the choice of House speaker, if Democrats win a majority, by picking the Texas ''blue dog'' leader, Representative Charles Stenholm. Bush will look toward Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma (a hawk on regulating hogs and poultry) and Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At Education, Gore would be torn between North Carolina's governor, Jim Hunt, and Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois, whose father leads the liberal charge against Ralph Nader's surprising uprising. Bush could reach across party lines to pick the Democrat Gerhard Casper, Stanford's ex-president, or stick with Lynne Cheney, his vice president's better campaign half.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000

  Mr. Gore, playing to older voters who turn out reliably at the polls, has been asserting that Mr. Bush's plan would drain from the system $1 trillion needed to pay benefits to current retirees. Casting themselves as the true reformers, Mr. Bush, of Texas, and his advisers said Mr. Gore's plan would saddle today's young people with $40 trillion in debt.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush wants to harness the power of the financial markets by allowing individuals to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in stocks and bonds.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore wants to leave the system unchanged and maintain the current level of guaranteed benefits even as the number of retirees grows substantially. To do so he would supplement payroll tax revenues with general income tax receipts. Separately, he has proposed tax incentives to help low and middle income people save for retirement outside of Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While Mr. Bush's proposal would bring more far-reaching changes to the system, each approach is revolutionary in its own way.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's plan would move the system away from its identity as a collective pact under which each generation of workers helps support the retirement of its predecessors. The Bush plan would nudge the system in the direction of having each worker save for his or her own retirement, shifting both opportunities and risks to individuals.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's plan would allow workers to place into their own investment accounts each year a little more than one-sixth of what they and their employers currently contribute directly to Social Security -- that is, 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's plan would be voluntary. People who are retired or near retirement would not see any changes in benefits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For those who do participate, Mr. Bush has said, there would be a menu of relatively safe and conservative investment options available.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But his approach creates problems that Mr. Bush avoids discussing. The most immediate is that allowing workers to place a portion of their payroll taxes in a private accounts reduces the amount of money available to pay benefits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Prodded by Mr. Gore in their final debate last week, Mr. Bush acknowledged that he would need to use $1 trillion out of the surplus over the next decade to cover the shortfall created by the establishment of personal accounts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Because Social Security is projected to run a surplus of more than $2 trillion during that period, using $1 trillion for private accounts would not immediately imperil the system's ability to pay full benefits to current retirees, as Mr. Gore has implied it would.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  According to the Gore camp, diverting two percentage points of the payroll tax into personal investment accounts would exhaust the trust fund in 2023, 14 years earlier than under the current system. In 2024, assuming no other changes are made, the system would be short of the money needed to pay benefits by hundreds of billions of dollars.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush and his advisers have declined to say if they would reduce the guaranteed benefit, a step that would clearly open a new line of attack for Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, Mr. Bush has not been willing to provide any details of how their plan would work, saying the specifics would have to be hashed out in a bipartisan way between Congress and a Bush administration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A guide to what a complete Bush plan might look like comes from similar plans introduced in Congress in recent years. All of them would cut guaranteed benefits, pump substantial amounts of general revenues into the system or require individuals to return to the system a portion of their investment gains from the personal accounts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The possible benefit cuts include such politically unpopular steps as raising the retirement age and reducing annual cost of living adjustments. And Mr. Bush has not given any indication of whether or how workers would be insulated from the risk of a stock market downturn around the time they retire.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Starting in 2011, Mr. Gore would then allocate to Social Security, out of general tax revenues, an amount equal to the interest saved from debt reduction -- $250 billion a year by 2016. The additional money, and the interest paid on it, would extend the system's solvency to 2054 from 2037.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On Monday, Mr. Bush said the revenue transferred to Social Security by Mr. Gore's plan, plus interest, would total nearly $40 trillion over four decades ending in 2050. That huge sum, Mr. Bush said, would weigh down the economy and future generations of taxpayers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides to Mr. Gore said the $40 trillion number had to be considered in the context of the size of the problem. Using the same type of calculation, they said, Mr. Bush's plan would require $57 trillion between 2023 and 2054 to keep the system solvent, unless Mr. Bush was willing to reduce guaranteed benefit payments or increase the payroll tax.

  Pennsylvania, with 23 electoral votes, is the country's fifth-largest electoral prize and one of a half-dozen or so major battlegrounds in the 2000 campaign. Polls show Mr. Gore and Gov. George W.

  Several Democratic officials said it was odd that Philadelphia's teachers' union could hurt Mr. Gore when both the union, which represents 21,000 teachers, and its parent, the American Federation of Teachers, had endorsed the vice president.

  ''Every vote that I don't get to the polls is a vote that I'm not able to give to Mr. Gore,'' said Jonathan A. Saidel, the city's controller and a leader of Philadelphia's Democratic Party. ''I think the turnout in Philadelphia, where we hope to bring in a 250,000-vote plurality for the Gore-Lieberman ticket, is indispensable for Gore winning Pennsylvania and the presidency.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000

  Teachers' union officials said they in no way intended to discourage voting. But they talked as if they did not mind that the fears that a strike might hurt Mr. Gore might pressure Mayor John F. Street, a Democrat, to settle the dispute.

  Our parents or grandparents, who were, in many cases, yellow-dog, blue-collar Democrats, would barely recognize the party of Bill Clinton and Al Gore as their own. To summarize the downside of the Clinton-Gore record: They failed to lift the minimum wage even up to the poverty level, although executive pay soared to more than 400 times that of the average working person. They pursued a trade policy rejected by unions and a majority of Americans. They blew their chance to create a national health insurance program, offering instead a plan that favored the big insurance companies. Mr. Gore's vision of health reform is even more constricted, consisting of little beyond proposed extension of Medicare coverage to prescription drugs. The Clinton-Gore administration has presided over a stunning expansion of the prison system -- necessitated by an increasingly senseless, and thoroughly bipartisan, war on drugs.

  For many Nader supporters, especially the feminists among us, the Democratic Party's biggest betrayal was the so-called ''reform'' of welfare. Instead of the generously financed welfare-to-work program that he initially proposed, Mr. Clinton signed an exceedingly punitive bill that essentially leaves the poorest single mothers and their children at the mercy of labor market, where entry-level wages remain at about $7 an hour. Mr. Gore boasts of his advocacy of welfare reform, but Deborah Leff, president of America's Second Harvest, a consortium of food banks, has said that food pantries all over the country are unable to meet the ''torrent of need.''

  Yes, like most Democrats who vote for Mr. Nader, I will be sorry if George Bush defeats Al Gore. I do see differences between the two candidates, not least in the kind of the Supreme Court appointments they are likely to make. But in the case of a Bush victory, don't expect me to be apologetic. It's not my fault if Mr. Gore has refused to stand up for the populist principles that might draw America's disenchanted majority back to the polls.

  They have said that by partly privatizing the entitlement program, Mr. Bush would endanger retirees' current level of benefits, a charge that Mr. Bush cannot afford to let stick.

  He said elderly people would fare better under his plan to change Medicare and give them a prescription drug benefit by encouraging them to join government-subsidized private insurance plans that included it.

And if you don't like the one the government puts you in, that's just too darned bad, because you don't have any choices under his plan.''

  Mr. Bush has visited Florida about once a week since Labor Day.

According to a new poll by the New York Times and CBS News, Mr. Gore leads Mr. Bush here by four percentage points among likely voters.

  Mr. Bush had begun his current swing through Florida with a rally in Jacksonville on Tuesday night, and from that moment on, there was a palpable sense of urgency and electricity to his events, which had the feel of eve-of-election exhortations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000

 <textdata>
  Held mostly in enormous spaces, Mr. Bush's rallies variously featured thundering music, dramatic lighting designs, fireworks, confetti, balloons and big, foot-stomping, passionately shouting crowds.

  And he kept both his brother and Mr. McCain, both of whom had faced questions about whether they were doing enough to promote Mr. Bush's campaign, close at his side. Jeb Bush repeatedly vowed to deliver a victory in Florida to the Bush campaign.

  Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, bolstered that effort, vouching for Mr. Bush's ability to keep America secure. He even went so far as to bring the recent bombing of a Navy ship in Yemen, which killed 17 Americans, into the political fray.

  ''We just saw in the tragedy that befell those brave young Americans onboard the U.S.S. Cole that we still live in a very dangerous world,'' Mr. McCain said in Daytona Beach. Then he said: ''We need a steady hand on the tiller. We need the kind of leadership that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney will provide this country so we cannot have those kinds of tragedies ever happen again.''

  Mr. Bush derided Democrats for phone calls that the Florida party had placed to thousands of voters to tell them that Mr. Bush's plans ''would undermine'' Social Security. Those words were part of a recorded message from the television actor Ed Asner that Mr. Bush said was intended to scare older voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At the rally in Brandon, near Tampa, tonight, Jeb Bush said: ''Let's tell Ed Asner to go back to Hollywood where he belongs.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He did so today by repeating his accusation that Mr. Gore's Social Security plan would create $40 trillion in debt by the middle of the century, a projection and figure that the Gore campaign has vigorously disputed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000

 <textdata>
  Many experts say Mr. Bush's own Social Security proposal, which would allow people to start investing part of their Social Security payroll taxes in private retirement accounts, also has extraordinary costs that he has been unwilling to acknowledge. Mr. Bush has not answered many questions about the transition from the current system to the one he is suggesting.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And while Mr. Bush turned H.M.O. into a nasty set of initials for the purpose of attacking Mr. Gore, many of the private insurance plans that his proposed changes in Medicare would coax people into would be H.M.O.'s.

  Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, in fact described the Bush plan as a deliberate effort to line the pockets of private companies, saying it was created ''for and by special interests.'' Ms. Spell also said that Mr. Bush was grossly mischaracterizing Mr. Gore's proposals.

  Gore's Russia Deal Called Legal  A 1995 deal signed by Vice President Al Gore and Viktor S.

  California Is No Longer A Sure Thing for Gore  Hard campaigning by Gov. George W. Bush and the Republican Party has tightened the presidential race in California, which Vice President Al Gore -- and most political analysts -- at one time had solidly in the Democrats' column. And the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, also figures in the erosion of Mr. Gore's once double-digit lead over Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  JUST after the political conventions this summer, it looked as if America had a clear-cut choice about how the economy should be managed. About $2.7 trillion of the projected $4.6 trillion in surpluses over the next 10 years are estimated to be generated by Social Security and Medicare. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas favored giving most of the rest -- some $1.3 trillion -- back to Americans in the form of a tax cut.

  Vice President Al Gore wanted to spend roughly $350 billion of it on a Medicare-based prescription drug plan for the elderly, but much of the rest, he said, should be devoted to a litany of programs for America's ''working families.'' Mr. Gore bolted out of the Democratic convention with a ratings lead.

Mr. Gore bolted out of the Democratic convention with a ratings lead.

 <textdata>
  Now, of course, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are about dead even in many polls.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Working with a smaller pie, Mr. Gore also gave precedence to the elderly over working families. The Social Security and Medicare surpluses would be placed in a ''lock box'' so they could not be spent. The prescription drug proposal was his largest social program by far, and some complained that even it was too restrictive. That left $1 trillion or so for other social programs, or $100 billion a year, including his own tax cut. He only proposed another $115 billion for education over 10 years, for example.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Despite that, Mr. Gore came up with several enticing ideas. He proposed to spend $200 billion to match the savings of middle-  and lower-income Americans, which he called Retirement Savings Plus. A couple earning $25,000 a year, for example, could put away $500 and receive another $1,500 from the government. The federal match would decline as incomes rose.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore proposed universal schooling for preschoolers and tuition tax credits -- solid new economy ideas. He wanted a higher minimum wage and a more generous earned-income tax credit. His tax cuts in general were aimed more at middle-  and lower-income workers than Mr. Bush's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But once Mr. Bush started accusing Mr. Gore of being a big spender and stressing a few social programs of his own, the tone of the campaign changed. One of the first hints was that the Gore campaign started using the term ''middle-class families'' instead of ''working families.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the 1980's and early 1990's, politicians made hay over the middle-class fear that social programs, especially for the poor, were eating into their standard of living. Apparently, Mr. Gore did not want to rekindle those fears, even though most American families, not just the poor, were still strained by stagnating incomes and more hours of work.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As part of the new plan, he also spent a lot of time criticizing Mr. Bush's budget plans. And Mr. Bush certainly appeared vulnerable. His stimulative tax cuts were proposed at the height of the business cycle, when they might have been most inflationary. The governor also refused to be specific about how he would pay for his Social Security privatization plan -- estimated to cost $1 trillion. Mr. Gore must have thought that he would strike gold, but so far it is lead.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the tax increases under former President George Bush and President Clinton, along with federal spending cuts of the early 1990's, were also intended to raise national savings. What happened instead was that, while the government reduced its deficit, individual Americans saved less and borrowed more. Over all, national saving has not risen appreciably to this day.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The true benefit of the tax increases and spending cuts, it turned out, was that they calmed investors, who bought bonds and sent interest rates lower. Today, the nation simply does not have to pay off the entire national debt, as Mr. Gore wants to do, to retain investors' confidence.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The new economy has new needs, including better education, more accessible child care, flexible work hours and higher wages for lower-income workers. If Mr. Gore loses the election, it will be wrong to say he overemphasized social spending. To the contrary, he doggedly tried to prove he was a fiscal conservative -- and confused his message in the process.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  First, Mr. Gore must re-connect with President Clinton and show that he is aligned with all that is good about the administration. This is not in conflict with ''being one's own man.'' He needs to emphasize that he will continue the popular policies of the Clinton administration, which have led to the prosperity and well-being of the last eight years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Second, Mr. Gore can let Mr. Clinton help deliver the message that we should not ''change horses in mid-stream,'' especially in view of the crisis in the Middle East.

  For more than a year, the smartest money in both major political parties on both coasts held that Gov. George W.

  More precisely, the California Republican Party is spending $1.5 million a week on television advertisements in support of Mr. Bush, including a new round of Spanish-language advertisements to start this week, while the Democrats are not spending a dime on television, and have no plans to, though they plan to run some radio commercials and -- at the request of Gov. Gray Davis -- to import President Clinton for a final get-out-the-vote tour.

  Mr. Gore, who has courted California assiduously in his eight years in the White House, has not visited the state since Sept. 20 and has no plans to return before Election Day. By contrast, Mr. Bush has spent 30 days in the state since June 1999, and is to come back next week to campaign and appear on the ''Tonight'' show with Jay Leno.
 </textdata>

  The institute's latest statewide poll ending last week found that Mr. Gore's lead over Mr. Bush had shrunk to five points among likely voters, 44 percent to 39 percent, with 6 percent for Mr. Nader. That is half the size of Mr. Gore's lead in the same poll a month ago, and some Democratic consultants say their own private surveys show the race even closer (within the margin of sampling error) among the likeliest voters. A Los Angeles Times poll, concluded on Monday and published today, showed Mr. Gore with a seven-point lead, 48 percent to 41 percent for Mr. Bush, with Mr. Nader at 5 percent.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's advisers say they are confident that his campaign has stabilized and is trending upward again after the dip that coincided with his performance in the first two presidential debates. But the unsettled situation here reflects the overall volatility of a close race, in which Mr. Gore finds himself struggling in states he should have locked up long ago, like Tennessee, his home state, and in which Mr. Bush is in a close contest in Florida, where his brother is governor and he had figured on a strong advantage.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush still faces formidable obstacles here. Mr. Gore holds a comfortable advantage among voters on most issues, from education to health care, Social Security and Medicare, and The Los Angeles Times poll shows that just over half of California voters have an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Bush, while 6 in 10 view Mr. Gore favorably.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While Mr. Gore has lost support to Mr. Nader, other minor-party candidates and the undecided column, Mr. Bush has not gained support, according to the Public Policy Institute poll. Among Hispanic voters, a group Mr. Bush has taken great pains to court, Mr. Gore still leads by ratios of better than two to one, and Mr. Bush's showing is little better than that of Dan Lungren, the party's failed nominee for governor here in 1998.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even Mr. Bush's advisers here are cautious in a state where Democrats hold an 11-point edge in voter registration and control all but one statewide office and both houses of the Legislature. Told by a reporter that Mr. Bush seemed to be doing well, his state campaign chairman, Gerald Parsky, said quickly, ''Better.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Parsky also noted that the campaign had done what it said it would more than a year ago, by bringing Mr. Bush to the state often for major policy speeches and appearances, by raising money to help the state party retire its debt, by grass-roots organizing intended to field 30,000 volunteers to help get out the vote on Election Day and by backing it all up with paid television advertising. The campaign began with a modest $600,000 a week statewide advertising push just after Labor Day and accelerated its efforts two weeks ago.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his appearances here, Mr. Bush has gone out of his way to try to soften the bad aftertaste, among Hispanic voters especially, left by Gov. Pete Wilson's strong campaigns against illegal immigration and affirmative action, and to reflect the reality that successful Republican presidents since the days of Dwight D. Eisenhower have all had a substantial political base here.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, Democrats here are more than a little worried about turnout. Partly because the Gore campaign long ago declared the state safe, there has been little sense of urgency here, and Mr. Gore has never managed to generate the enthusiasm among California Democrats that Mr. Clinton did in two aggressive campaigns. Mr. Bush is leading in traditional swing areas like the Central Valley and the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles, while Mr. Nader is drawing double-digit support in the San Francisco Bay area, which should be a Democratic stronghold.

  Last week, reflecting pent-up frustrations, Governor Davis's chief political adviser, Garry South, issued a sharp public warning that the Gore campaign risked taking the state for granted and pleading for more support. After his comments caused a stir, Mr. South swiftly took pains to say that Mr. Gore would still win, but his point was not lost on Republicans, who for the last two elections have found themselves pleading with their national party for a serious effort in a state that former President George Bush's aides publicly abandoned in 1992 and where Bob Dole made a desperate last-minute push in 1996.

  ''Every piece of evidence that we rely on shows that Al Gore remains in a very strong position in California,'' said Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager. ''We watch it very closely. It's obviously a critical state for us. But Al Gore's positions on the issues are so much more in sync with Californians than Bush's are.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But other Democrats here point to more complicated realities. Mr. Gore is fighting fires on too many other fronts to suddenly open an advertising campaign in California's brutally expensive media markets, and the mere act of doing so could set off broader anxiety about his campaign's overall prospects that could have a snowball effect.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000

  ''Unfortunately for the Gore campaign, they set up a perception for a long, long time that they were safe here, and they sold it and they spun it and they're stuck with it,'' said a Democratic operative here who spoke on the condition of anonymity but worries that Mr. Gore is vulnerable here. ''I sympathize with them, and they've got other states to worry about. But we are not crying wolf.''

Then children wave flags as the words ''leave no child behind'' appear on the screen. Mr. Bush then appears again, speaking, in shirt sleeves. Then a little boy in a classroom appears, followed by Mr. Bush in a suit with some adults in a classroom. Then Boy Scouts raise a flag.

  THE SCRIPT -- Governor Bush: ''How come the hard things don't get done? Because they're hard. If we really want to make sure no child gets left behind in America, we need the courage to do some tough things. We need to raise standards in our schools. We need more accountability and more discipline. And we need to stop promoting failing kids to the next grade because we've given up on them. It's easy just to spend more. Let's start by expecting more.''

  SCORECARD -- This advertisement was prepared and started showing before a recent study by the RAND Corporation, a California research organization, challenging the claims Mr. Bush has made about progress in education in Texas. Its pace is not as frantic as some earlier commercials. It deals with the issue that voters, regardless of whether they support Mr. Bush or Vice President Al Gore, cite more often than any other as the most important issue facing the next president and Congress. The return to this theme emphasizes the central issue that Mr. Bush has used to portray himself to voters as a different kind of Republican.

  Members of the groups contribute to Republicans and Democrats alike, and have been courted by various politicians, including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. He recently met with the American Muslim Council in Michigan, which has a sizable Arab-American population, and received its backing. The council also says it considers Senator Joseph I. Lieberman a friend, and it gave him an award a few years ago.

  The Bush campaign said yesterday it would return $1,000 that had been donated by Abdurahman Alamoudi, a board member of the American Muslim Council, who was quoted in interviews as supporting the radical Islamic group Hamas.

  The two Muslim groups belong to the larger American Muslim Political Coordination Council Political Action Committee, which endorsed Mr. Bush at a news conference in Washington on Monday.

  Dr. Yahya Mossa-Basha, a radiologist in Michigan who is president of the American Muslim Council, said he had met twice with Mr. Bush -- once last month -- and once with Vice President Al Gore, Tipper Gore and Hadassah Lieberman. He said he had recently had discussions with the Gore campaign about meeting the vice president this Sunday, but no date had been set. He also said he was invited to a Lazio fund-raising event attended by Mr. Lazio last August in Michigan, but decided not to attend. The Lazio campaign said it did not invite Mr. Mossa-Basha, but said it did not know if a Lazio supporter had invited him.

  Mr. Alamoudi, whose $1,000 contributions are to be returned by the Clinton and Bush campaigns, was out of the country and could not be reached for comment, Mr. Mossa-Basha said. But Mr. Mossa-Basha said that as an organization, the council is clear about Hamas and violence in the Middle East.

  Mrs. Clinton implied that the Daily News article was prompted by the Republicans, suggesting that they would be eager to associate a prominent Democrat with the Muslim organizations at the time the groups were endorsing Mr. Bush. The Daily News, however, referred to research by Steven Emerson, who identified himself as a freelance journalist preparing a magazine article on terrorism; he became well known when he initially strongly suggested that the Oklahoma City bombing was the work of Arab terrorists. Mr. Emerson, who attended Mrs. Clinton's news conference, said Republicans and Democrats were both willing to associate with groups that he considered sympathetic to terrorists or aligned with them.

  Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly asserted that Texas, under Gov. George W. Bush, neglected the health care needs of its residents. In view of such criticism, governors said, it was paradoxical for the Clinton administration to try to slash Medicaid payments to states like Illinois and New York, which say they have used the money to expand health programs for the poor.

  Back in June, we criticized Ralph Nader's presidential bid as a self-indulgent crusade that could gull some voters into thinking that there were no clear policy choices between Al Gore and George Bush. As the election nears, what once seemed a speculative threat has become a very real danger to the Gore campaign, with polls suggesting that Mr. Nader's meager share of the vote could nevertheless make the difference in eight states with 70 electoral votes. That is one reason Mr. Gore returned this week to places like Washington and Oregon. In these and other states that once seemed safe for the vice president, Mr. Nader is wooing liberals by arguing that both parties are captives of the same financial interests. He also appears to be hurting Mr. Gore with charges that he has betrayed his principles and promises on the environment.

  We would regard Mr. Nader's willful prankishness as a disservice to the electorate no matter whose campaign he was hurting. The country deserves a clear up-or-down vote between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, who have waged a hard, substantive and clean campaign. Of course, voters who want to cast an ideological protest vote for Mr. Nader have a perfect right to do so. But more tactically minded voters should recognize that unlike Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, Mr. Nader can fling charges and espouse positions without worrying about their impact on his chances of winning or even about having to govern on the basis of his promises.

  For Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, every adjustment in a position gains or costs votes. Mr. Nader has the luxury of taking free throws. In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal he seemed almost excited by the idea that a Gore defeat could lead to a ''progressive convulsion'' -- a leftward shift among Democrats away from the Clinton administration's centrist policies. Yet anyone who has followed the course of progressive politics over the last quarter-century knows that such a shift is a formula for defeat precisely because it does not reflect the mood of those voters inclined to support moderate or liberal candidates. The spectrum has shifted, and Mr. Nader cannot jerk it back by demolishing Democratic chances.

  Mr. Nader's description of Mr. Gore's environmental record is particularly obtuse, for there is no area in which voters are being offered a clearer choice. Mr. Bush would explore for oil in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Mr. Gore would not. Mr. Gore would prohibit new roads and logging on more than 40 million acres of national forest, Mr. Bush would not. Mr. Gore holds open the option of tearing down four dams that threaten Snake River salmon runs, while Mr. Bush flatly opposes decommissioning. Mr. Gore favors the vigorous enforcement of clean air rules to reduce industrial pollutants, Mr. Bush favors a negotiated approach. Whichever side one favors, the Texas governor and the vice president offer as stark a choice on the environment as was ever put on view in a presidential contest.

  Mr. Nader's other main complaint is that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are equally beholden to the special interests, and certainly the candidates and their parties have parallel histories in regard to seeking corporate contributions. But their approaches to systemic reform of the electoral system are very different. For example, Mr. Gore would eliminate all forms of soft money -- corporate, labor and individual contributions -- whereas Mr. Bush would allow the large individual contributions that have done so much to corrupt the system. Yet Mr. Nader acts as if the presidential election would have no impact on the future of campaign finance legislation. In so doing he deludes his followers, brightens Mr. Bush's prospects and dims his own legacy as a reformer. He calls his wrecking-ball candidacy a matter of principle, but it looks from here like ego run amok.

  It is disconcerting for the Gore campaign that the vice president cannot take Tennessee and its 11 electoral votes for granted at this point, and that the Democratic National Committee has had to invest money in advertising there. But Mr. Gore and his aides have argued that the vice president's roots in Carthage, Tenn., and his 24-year political career in the state cannot be expected to overcome its recent political domination by Republicans.

  After summarizing his philosophy about the role of government on Tuesday, Mr. Gore turned his attention today to education in his address to students at Tennessee State University, a historically black college.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore outlined his proposals for using federal money to hire 100,000 new teachers, to reduce class sizes, to provide universal preschool to 4-year-olds, to provide families with tax deductions of up to $10,000 a year for college tuition, to force states and local school boards to change the administration of persistently failing schools and to increase testing of  students and teachers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore devoted most of his remarks to arguing that Mr. Bush's support for private school vouchers would undermine public education, that his ''budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthiest'' demonstrate misplaced priorities and that the integrity of student testing in Texas was questionable.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, he said, ''would give more in tax cuts to the wealthiest 90,000 multimillionaires than he would give in the form of all the new investments he has proposed to make in all 90,000 public schools combined.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As he has throughout the campaign, Mr. Gore rejected the concept of vouchers, which would provide some parents of children in poor-performing schools with grants to send their children to private schools.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Gore's comments defined him as ''the chief defender of the status quo in the public schools.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore laced his attack with provocative new metaphors. Mr. Bush's voucher plan, he said, would make Washington ''a national private school headmaster.'' Because not all students would receive help from vouchers, the plan amounts to ''education roulette,'' he said. Mr. Bush's opposition to spending federal money to hire thousands of new teachers, Mr. Gore added, ''is like trying to write on a blackboard without any chalk.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also used the speech to make his first remarks about a study released this week by the RAND Corporation, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif., that raised questions about the effectiveness of student testing in Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Because Mr. Bush has made his educational record in Texas a hallmark of his campaign, the Gore forces have treated the RAND study as an October gift. Mr. Lieberman used it to attack Mr. Bush on Tuesday, and Mr. Gore took his turn today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is the bottom line,'' Mr. Gore said. ''We cannot afford to teach kids how to take a state test while leaving them with serious learning deficits. We cannot afford that kind of short-sighted shortcut in education policy any more than we can afford it in economic policy where we cannot afford to cook the books and bust our budget, leaving America with endless financial deficits.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said practices like teaching to the test ''might elevate the reputations of school administrators and politicians but actually do nothing to really raise standards.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now, my opponent, Governor Bush, has a different approach because he has different priorities. He would give more in tax cuts to the wealthiest 90,000 multimillionaires than he would give in the form of all the new investments he has proposed to make in all 90,000 public schools combined. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Under the Bush plan, states would be forced to offer vouchers and finance them out of their budgets -- a brand new federal mandate -- whether states and local school districts like vouchers or not. . . . Governor Bush says he doesn't want a national superintendent of schools, but his mandatory voucher plan would make Washington, D.C., a national private school headmaster.''

  If Vice President Al Gore has failed to close the sale with some voters on policy grounds, like promising to put the Medicare surplus in a lockbox, he has now come up with a few new arguments.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  First, there is the notion that Mr. Gore does not care about making money and never has. Not like some oil speculators and baseball team owners he could mention. And this apparently is a good thing, even though many Americans would love to have made $15 million by selling a baseball team, as Gov. George W. Bush did when his partnership sold the Texas Rangers in 1998.

  ''I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth,'' Mr. Gore told a crowd in Everett, Wash., on Monday. ''I have spent the last 24 years fighting for middle-class working families.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's aversion to wealth apparently has the approval of his wife, Tipper. ''This is a man who has spent his time not getting up every day figuring out how much money he can make for himself,'' Mrs. Gore said in introducing her husband in Little Rock, Ark., on Tuesday, ''but figuring out how he can fight for working people.''

  Still not persuaded? Maybe that is because you were not aware that Mr. Gore has attended all of his son's high school football games this fall, despite his rigorous campaign schedule. The Gores had kept politics and football separate until this week, when an article in The New York Times documented the vice president's devotion to the Sidwell Friends Quakers. Now they seem to have concluded that it is a story worth telling.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He has made every single one of our son's football games,'' Mrs. Gore said at a rally on Tuesday in Shreveport, La., in remarks aimed directly at women. ''I don't really want to share that with everybody. It's personal. But it matters.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  For each of the last three mornings, Mr. Gore has gone about the task of making pretty pictures by holding ''kitchen table'' discussions with voters. None have actually taken place at a kitchen table, but that is beside the point. On Monday, he sat down at a bakery in Portland, Ore., with a small business owner; on Tuesday in Little Rock, he helped Bobbie and Mollie Goza walk their two children to elementary school; today, in Nashville, he sat down with the guys at a local firehouse.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Ian, you're really in kindergarten?'' Mr. Gore asked the Gozas' 5-year-old son, who nodded affirmatively.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But whether Mr. Gore's words make news is also beside the point. Thus far, the gimmick has worked precisely as intended. In both Portland and Little Rock, pictures of the kitchen-table moments landed on the front pages of local newspapers and were featured prominently in local television broadcasts. The national television networks have also made liberal use of the images, and a picture of Mr. Gore with the Gozas appeared today in The New York Times.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After two years of campaigning -- some would say after eight years of campaigning -- it is not every day that Mr. Gore gets a question he has yet to consider.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But while speaking to a few reporters on Air Force II on Tuesday, Mr. Gore was confronted with one of the great queries of our time. ''What do you think of the designated hitter?'' asked Bill Douglas of Newsday.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore had already taken an expedient pass on the question of which team he likes in the World Series, saying ''I'm for New York.'' Now, said the reporters on the plane, Mr. Gore paused for 20 to 30 seconds, as if calculating the swing-state impact of his response on undecided voters in various American League and National League cities.

  RIFLE ASSOCIATION BACKS BUSH  Without fanfare, the National Rifle Association's political action committee has endorsed Gov. George W. Bush for president, posting a notice on its Web site earlier this week. Though it has been clear for months that the politically potent group would work to defeat Vice President Al Gore, there had been questions about whether it would endorse Mr. Bush because of concerns among some Republicans that the group's backing could turn off centrist voters and women. But in his monthly column in one of the rifle association's magazines, the group's president, Charlton Heston, trumpets the endorsement, saying that ''Bush has steadfastly supported gun owners' rights.'' In September, the organization also contributed $961,826 to help Mr. Bush's campaign, federal election records show. Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, said the endorsement showed that Mr. Bush ''is the candidate of the gun lobby.'' But Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, replied, ''When it comes to special interest funding and support, Al Gore knocks it out of the park.''

  THE VIDEOTAPE INCIDENT  A lawyer for Thomas J. Downey, a senior Gore adviser who six weeks ago received a videotape of Gov. George W. Bush's debate preparation, asserted yesterday that it was becoming evident that the incident was a dirty trick by people in the Bush campaign. The lawyer, Marc E. Miller, in a letter to the attorney general and the director of the F.B.I., said that the two top law enforcement officials should make a public statement on their conclusions before Election Day. Mr. Miller wrote, ''It now appears to be more likely than not that the original transmission of the material to Mr. Downey was not, in fact, a misguided act of a single person acting alone as Mr. Downey had initially assumed, but rather the concerted, intentional act by more than one person associated with the Bush campaign.'' The Bush camp has denied that it was involved in any plan to make the Gore campaign look like it was cheating in preparation for the debates. Law enforcement officials said yesterday that they had not yet completed their investigation of the incident.

  PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WEIGHS IN  Citizens for Better Medicare, a group largely financed by the pharmaceutical industry, says that over the past few months it has spent more than $8.3 million on television advertisements that take aim at the Clinton-Gore administration's proposal to provide prescription drug benefits under Medicare. The advertisements, warning that the proposal would lead to government price controls and rationing of life-saving drugs, are running in many of the same television markets around the country in which Gov. George W. Bush is running commercials. Like Mr. Bush, the pharmaceutical industry favors a plan that would subsidize individual purchases of medicines. The finances of Citizens for Better Medicare had been shrouded in secrecy for months. But a few days ago it was forced to report details under provisions of a new federal law. Among other things, the first report revealed that all of the group's advertising money has gone to National Media, a firm run by Alex Castellanos, who also coordinates advertising by the Republican National Committee and the Bush campaign.

  Governor Bush and Mr. Gore have spent little time campaigning in New York during the general election, given that the heavily Democratic state is expected to go for the Gore ticket.

  The Republican National Committee released a new 30-second Spanish-language television commercial this week that promotes Gov. George W. Bush's promise to improve public schools and salutes his record on the issue in Texas. It is running in five states, most of them where the presidential candidates are in close races and all of them with many Hispanic voters: California, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Pennsylvania.

  ON THE SCREEN -- The television commercial opens with black-and-white images of an impoverished barrio: a rundown house, a sorrowful man sitting on a curb, a lonely boy walking among the weeds that have sprouted under a bridge. Then, as the subject of the spoken words changes from the neglect of Hispanic people around the country to the strides being made by Hispanic students in Texas, the images bloom into full color, focusing on the happy faces and postures of a Hispanic teacher and her Hispanic students in a classroom. Hispanic children run merrily outside a school. And then Mr. Bush, in color and in close-up, talks directly to the viewer.

  THE SCRIPT -- (translated from Spanish to English by the Bush campaign) -- First, an unseen announcer says, ''They say that the economy's better than ever, but in our neighborhoods, we feel forgotten. We need a better education. And that means a new commitment. In Texas, Governor Bush raised academic standards and teacher salaries. Test scores improved. Now minority children in Texas lead the country in academic improvement.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush, speaking Spanish, says, ''For me, education is No. 1. Because our children deserve the best.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ACCURACY -- Under Mr. Bush's watch, Texas did raise standards and salaries, and Mr. Bush demonstrated as much interest in education as in any other issue. But some of the claims here about his education record are selective and broad. By some measures, in some grades, minority children in Texas were at or near the top in the nation for improvement; by others, they fared less well, especially in higher grades. Scores on standardized college-admission tests, for example, have not changed much.

  Mr. Bush, as both a governor and a presidential candidate, has spoken in a more welcoming, concerned voice about Hispanic immigrants than most other Republicans. But critics say he has not moved nearly as aggressively as he could have to make sure that poor children in Texas, Hispanic and otherwise, have health care or to improve conditions in the impoverished ''colonias'' of Hispanic immigrants near the Mexican border.

 <textdata>
  SCORECARD -- In some ways, the subject matter and the claims here are less important than the language being spoken, which tells Hispanic voters that they matter. It is a message they are receiving louder and clearer this election year than ever before; in fact, this is the fourth Spanish-language commercial the Republican committee has released. The goal is for Mr. Bush to blunt Democrats' advantage with Hispanic voters, and the hope that he can do that is fueled by the demographics behind his 1998 re-election in Texas. Some surveys showed Mr. Bush receiving nearly half the Hispanic vote.

  The pundits' incantatory verdict on debate 3 says Al Gore won ''on points,'' but didn't much affect the tightest horse race in 40 years. That's true, but I do think there was a single clear-cut winner in this and maybe all three debates -- the elephant (albeit Democratic) in the room, Bill Clinton. Though his name has barely been mentioned -- and on Tuesday only by George W. Bush, who also applauded the president for his efforts at Sharm el Sheik -- his shadow loomed large over almost every exchange. Mr. Gore's persistently ineffectual boxing with that shadow, rather than his fisticuffs with Mr. Bush, may yet determine his fate as we slouch toward a potential record-low turnout on Nov. 7.

  The trick this year has been for a candidate to harness himself to the virtues of a president whose job approval rating remains high (60 percent) while staying clear of his personal failings. This should have been a lock for Mr. Gore, an impeccable family man who was, after all, a partner in a presidency that has presided over skyrocketing employment and home ownership and plummeting welfare rolls and crime rates. But the vice president is so intent on shucking the ''bad'' Clinton that he has rarely capitalized on the ''good'' Clinton. He doesn't seem to realize that the president's residual popularity is such that in a hypothetical Clinton-Bush match-up in an ABC News poll this month Mr. Bush was behind by five points. When Darrell Hammond, who also impersonates Mr. Gore, revived his Clinton-as-scamp on ''Saturday Night Live'' last weekend, the audience welcomed him back like a conquering hero.

  Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton aren't buddies these days, as Melinda Henneberger and Don Van Natta Jr. chronicled in yesterday's Times. The Gore command has not only debated the value of Mr. Clinton's making a last-minute campaign blitz to mobilize the party faithful, but doesn't want the two men appearing together in any case. A far more damaging image, though, has been Mr. Gore's visible, Hamlet-like vacillation about the president during the debates. The vice president rarely trumpets his own administration's record -- lest he get caught mentioning the dread ''C'' word in prime time. This may be his way of proving that he is his ''own man,'' but it makes him look more condescending to voters than his sighs and eye-rolling ever did -- for the implication is that we're as dumb as those on-air focus groups and don't remember where he's been, for better and worse, for the past eight years.

  At the same time Mr. Gore has gone berserk in trying to prove that he's no Clintonesque cad (as if anyone thought he was). From the overheated disowning of a congresswoman's convention-week fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion to the excessive use of his wife and children as props to his lofty rhetoric about ''values'' (five such vacuous sermonettes in debate 2 alone), this campaign is not only holier-than-thou but preachier than William Bennett flogging a book of virtues. Mr. Gore's incorrigible running mate, Joe Lieberman, has now taken to invoking Scripture to back up his stands on health care and environmentalism.

  Incredibly, Mr. Bush -- a candidate with minimal grasp of policy (his own positions often included) -- has figured this out (or at least his handlers have). When he incessantly promises, as he did on Tuesday, to ''change the tone'' in a Washington marked by ''bickering'' and ''bitterness'' and ''arguing,'' what is he attacking if not the Gingrich Congress that shut down the government and tried to run Mr. Clinton out of town? Thus does Mr. Bush ingeniously, if disingenuously, triangulate in the most shameless Clintonesque manner -- making himself look like more of a foe of such Washington Clinton-haters as Tom DeLay and Dan Burton than Mr. Gore is.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has also cunningly hijacked some of the Clinton rhetorical playbook that defeated his father in '92. In the debate held eight years ago at this week's site, Washington University in St. Louis, the then-Governor Clinton talked, as George W. now does, of how he wanted to ''bring this country together, not divide it,'' and of how ''Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.'' It was also in the '92 debates that Mr. Clinton boasted of how he had worked with Republicans and Democrats in his own state to find ''common-sense'' solutions to ''the real problems of real people.'' Though Mr. Bush stops short of saying that he feels anyone's pain, he talked about the love in his heart so often on Tuesday that John Podhoretz, a Bush supporter, wrote in The New York Post that it was ''enough to make your skin crawl.'' The Texas governor also promises an administration with ''people who represent all America'' -- his modest variation on the Clinton promise of one that ''looks like America.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  It may all be hooey -- Mr. Bush's current administration doesn't even reflect the minority demographics of Texas -- but it reminds people, at least subliminably (as he might say), of what they liked (and may still like) about Mr. Clinton. The cosmetic Clintonization of Mr. Bush has been so effective that the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds that voters ''who approve of Clinton's job performance but do not like him personally'' prefer Bush to Gore by 55 to 24. Only a month ago the Bush-Gore margin in this same group and poll was a narrow 42 to 37.

  Democrats anticipating the worst are starting to look for scapegoats. If an incumbent vice president loses at a time of peace and prosperity to an opponent with modest achievements, a wealthy scion's work ethic (9-to-5 days punctuated by long runs and photo ops, according to Texas records) and a tendency to speak in tongues, it must be Ralph Nader's fault, or Jim Lehrer's, or a press that lets Mr. Bush get away with fibs far more substantive than Mr. Gore's exaggerations. If the vice president himself is faulted by his own partisans, it's usually only for superficial failings -- mainly his grating personality makeovers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But it's not that simple. If Mr. Bush epitomizes the consistency of small minds as he offers boilerplate, banalities and evasions to almost any question put to him, Mr. Gore epitomizes the paralysis that can befall even a fertile mind that is in abject, craven fear of giving offense. In his own way the vice president can be as inarticulate as Mr. Bush -- witness his inability in the debates to clearly differentiate his position on gun control, or to use any of his digressions to challenge the single most chilling moment of the entire campaign, the governor's grinning (and, as it turned out, inaccurate) boast of how Texas would ''put to death'' all three men who murdered James Byrd. It took an ordinary citizen in the final debate to find the courage to call Mr. Bush on his inhumanity, and even then Mr. Gore never did pick up the theme.

  The calls from Mrs. Bush -- tens of thousands were made last weekend to older voters across the state -- are but one example of an extravagant effort this year by both parties and the presidential campaigns to woo the votes of the elderly in Florida.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The reason is clear. With 25 electoral votes, Florida is the largest state still in serious contention, and Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore are running neck and neck here.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000

 <textdata>
  Three dozen retirees interviewed in the Tampa Bay area this weekend, for example, showed little inclination to vote as a bloc based on their self-interest, and said that the Bush and Gore plans for Social Security and Medicare left them more confused than comforted.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But as much as they think and talk about it, the people interviewed cannot see much difference between Mr. Gore's proposal for prescription drug coverage and Mr. Bush's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's just too complicated to understand,'' said Bill Hinver, 81, a retired machinist from Pittsburgh. ''I mean, Bush has a plan and Gore has a plan. But they're just running for election, and they'll promise you everything and give you nothing.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On balance, Mr. Hinver, a committed Republican, said he thought Mr. Bush had a better drug proposal, but he could not explain why.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Mikszenas, who worked in production control for General Electric, agreed that Mr. Bush's plan was probably better. But he added, ''It's just too complicated, and I don't pretend to understand it thoroughly.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The fact is, there are big philosophical differences between the Gore and Bush drug plans. But it is not surprising that voters are confused, because comparing them line by line is impossible.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore would expand the government's Medicare program so that a drug benefit would be available voluntarily to all older Americans for an additional monthly premium. Mr. Bush would try to induce competition among private insurance companies to sell drug coverage to the elderly, with the government partly subsidizing the premiums.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But retirees cannot figure which plan would help them more, because Mr. Bush has left many details unspecified, including what his basic benefit would be worth, what the deductibles and co-payments would be and what would happen if the government subsidy in his plan proved to be insufficient to get companies to offer the coverage.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, taken as a group, elderly voters do vote somewhat differently than younger ones do. In Florida, a poll this month by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research found that voters 65 and older favored Mr. Gore, 51 percent to 37 percent. Younger voters favored Mr. Bush by approximately the same margin.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For example, in the 1998 election for governor here, a majority of voters 60 and older voted for the Republican candidate, Jeb Bush, who was elected, but a majority of those 65 and older voted for his Democratic opponent, Buddy MacKay.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Her opponent in the New York race, Representative Rick A. Lazio, will not let her forget. He calls her health plan ''an unmitigated disaster.'' Likewise, Gov. George W. Bush chides Al Gore, saying the vice president joined Mrs. Clinton in fighting for ''a government-run health care system'' in 1993.

  Despite the scrutiny applied to George W. Bush's life this election season, one small chapter has largely escaped attention. In an episode he has discussed with a few friends but not biographers, Mr. Bush spent the summer of 1974 working for a young airline-and-construction business in Alaska, during the oil-boom days when construction on the 800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline was just beginning.
 </textdata>

  Bob Heath, who would bring him here to work in the noisy, chaotic airport offices of the young company, Alaska International Industries, recalls receiving a letter from an executive at a Houston construction company asking about a summer job for Mr. Bush, then 27 and halfway through two years at Harvard Business School.

  Assured that Mr. Bush would, Mr. Heath replied, ''Ship him up.''
 </textdata>

  ''We had never heard of George Bush,'' Mr. Heath said recently.  ''Didn't have a clue.'' But Mr. Bush was a college graduate who had decided to pursue a business career,  ''and we could use all we could get our hands on.''

  The aviation arm of Alaska International had a colorful list of clients, including the Central Intelligence Agency and the shah of Iran. But Mr. Bush knew nothing about them, says Dan Bartlett, whom the Bush presidential campaign has placed in charge of dealing with the press on biographical matters.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush, who had been trained as a military pilot in the Texas Air National Guard before enrolling in business school, was given a desk job in the planning department of Alaska International, which was trying to cope with an avalanche of work.

 <textdata>
  ''As I remember,'' Mr. Heath said,  Mr. Bush ''was a great help in trying to figure out what we were going to be when we grew up. No one understood which move to make next. We were trying to structure the company.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What might seem puzzling about Mr. Bush's sojourn in Alaska is that it never comes up. His autobiography does not mention it. Nor do three other biographies of him published recently. Reporters on his campaign plane say they cannot recall his ever mentioning it, and many of his friends say they have never heard him refer to it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his book, Mr. Bush recounts the summers he spent delivering mail at a law firm, working for a stockbroker, roughnecking on an offshore oil rig, helping out on a ranch and selling sporting goods. But there is no mention of Alaska.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bartlett, the Bush spokesman,  said he did not know why the summer job had not come up before in interviews with the governor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As for why Mr. Bush himself so rarely mentions it, Mr. Bartlett said it was so long ago, so brief and so uneventful that it hardly ever seemed to the governor worth mentioning.
 </textdata>

  When Mr. Bush arrived in Fairbanks, Alaska International Industries was a fledgling business whose holdings included Alaska International Air, an air cargo company that was loading its giant Lockheed-382 Hercules airplanes, the civilian version of C-130's, with construction equipment and supplies and flying them to pipeline workers 24 hours a day.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the summer of 1974, however, during the period Mr. Bush worked at the company, Alaska International Air was too busy flying supplies to the pipeline to take work outside Alaska, Mr. Bergt said. He said Mr. Bush ''wouldn't have known'' about the connections between Alaska International and the C.I.A., although he ''might have heard some talk around the company.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In 1974, Fairbanks was jammed with construction workers. Mr. Bush rented a room with kitchen privileges from Grace Danks, a widow who worked as a waitress and lived in a two-story house in a tidy neighborhood close to downtown.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Sally Smith, a Democrat who is the new mayor of Juneau, was living in Fairbanks that summer and says she went out with Mr. Bush several times. They were introduced, she recalls, by Alex Miller, a Democrat who worked as a Washington lobbyist for Mr. Bergt.

  Betsy Brenneman, who would later work as a journalist in Alaska, sat next to Mr. Bush at the wedding of two Harvard Business School graduates in Davenport, Iowa, in October 1976. The bride, who had been her college roommate, had told her of Mr. Bush's Alaska work.

  When Mr. McCain finally caught up with the Bush campaign in Maine, he showed no reservations. He and Mr. Bush shook hands with the crowd, side by side. Mr. McCain waved even more antically from the stage than Mr. Bush did, earning a roar when he was introduced by Senator Olympia J. Snowe. And Mr. McCain, the man who once declared to audiences that he was ''fully prepared to lead,'' implying that the governor wasn't, gave Mr. Bush his blessings this time.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Who do you think won those debates?'' Mr. McCain called out, drawing a chant of ''Bush! Bush! Bush!'' from the crowd.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You saw in Governor Bush a man who was calm,'' Mr. McCain said, ''a man who was assured, a man who was fully prepared to assume the responsibilities'' of the White House. And hammering home the idea that Vice President Al Gore gave distinctly different performances in the three presidential debates, he said, ''On the other side I saw three different people, didn't you?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Once more he declared Mr. Bush  ''fully prepared to restore integrity and respect to the White House.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Soon Mr. Bush was center stage, drawing sharp contrasts with Mr. Gore. ''He trusts Washington and I trust you, and that's one of the reasons I'm going to become your president.'' Mr. Bush said, ''I can't make it any more plain.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush had to go it alone in New Hampshire, where Mr. McCain not only defeated him in the Republican primary but also piled up the widest victory margin since Ronald Reagan defeated Mr. Bush's father there 20 years ago.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At St. Anselm's College in Manchester, where a big green banner proclaimed ''New Hampshire Welcomes the Reformers,'' Mr. Bush took questions at the kind of town hall meeting that Mr. McCain made his trademark.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm so glad to be back in New Hampshire,'' Mr. Bush said, winning  thunderous applause. ''Some folks might have assumed I wasn't coming back. But I'm a better candidate as a result of campaigning last winter in this great state. I am. This is a state that puts you through your paces.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And though Mr. Bush had to tell the crowd that Mr. McCain ''took ill,'' he praised him and took up some of his causes as he mentioned things that Washington could do to prevent the end-of-year brinkmanship over spending bills that is taking place  now as the Congressional session ends.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Saying the nation needed ''less bickering and finger-pointing and name-calling and needless partisanship,'' Mr. Bush called for federal budgeting to take place every two years instead of annually and for a ''constitutional'' line-item veto.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Texas governor was not the only one invoking Mr. McCain today. The Gore campaign said it was going on the air with a 30-second spot remembering the senator's criticism of Mr. Bush's tax cut and fiscal plan. ''George W. Bush is back in New Hampshire,'' it says. ''The question is will he come clear on Social Security. In this year's election John McCain said Bush's plan has not one new penny for Social Security.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush continued to criticize Mr. Gore for his claim in the last presidential debate that he does not favor big government. ''It's one of the more amazing statements of the campaign,'' he said. ''He is of Washington, by Washington, for Washington.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush criticized Mr. Gore's record at his signature project of reinventing government. 'He claimed he has significantly reduced the size of government,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but what he didn't tell you is that 87 percent of the cuts came from the Department of Defense, thousands of jobs were cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For all the talk of buried hatchets, Mr. McCain has not always been an effusive supporter of the Republican ticket. On CNN's ''Larry King Live'' recently, Mr. McCain had equal praise for Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's running mate, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate. And in New Hampshire earlier this week to campaign for a local candidate, Mr. McCain said he was trying to urge young people to vote, no matter who they vote for, and ''if you don't vote for Governor Bush, I understand and respect that.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush won many spirited ovations in New Hampshire, but some in his crowd wished Mr. McCain were still in the race. ''I think he would have been a better president for the country,'' said John Allard. ''But George Bush has got the nomination, and I don't think he'll make a bad president. Of the choice, it's the best we have.''

  The public displays of affection did not change a political reality: Mr. Gore has made a conscious effort to nudge Mr. Clinton to the sidelines as he seeks to follow him in the presidency.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Fabiani said that the president was making radio commercials for Mr. Gore and taping a telephone message that would be delivered automatically to likely voters in areas where the president is popular. He said Mr. Clinton would also raise money for the Democratic National Committee and was planning a campaign trip to California for the vice president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Beyond that,'' Mr. Fabiani said, ''nothing has been scheduled with the president, and we anticipate that Al Gore will conclude the campaign as he has been running it -- as his own man and on his own vision.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore himself hedged about the matter today, both in a television interview and as he spoke to reporters on Air Force Two. He noted that the president had a ''full-time job'' and was busy with Congress and foreign policy. And he rebuffed all efforts to be dragged into a discussion of his complex relationship with the president or respond to reports that the president was hurt that Mr. Gore had not sought his help and advice.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm running as my own man,'' Mr. Gore said repeatedly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Clinton, responding to an article in The New York Times today, denied that he had been upset at Mr. Gore for not involving him more actively in the campaign. ''Not true,'' he said, jabbing his finger in the air for emphasis as he strolled toward his plane after the memorial service  with reporters in tow. ''It's categorically not true.'' And Mr. Clinton deferred to Mr. Gore on how he could best help the Gore-Lieberman ticket.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'll do whatever's best,'' the president said, indicating there was still time before the election for Mr. Gore to enlist his help. ''I don't know. It's too soon to say. We've got to wait until we're a little closer.''
 </textdata>

  10-21-2000

  And Mr. Siewert pointed out that the president had not exactly been sitting on his hands this campaign season. So far this year, Mr. Clinton has attended nearly 180 fund-raisers on behalf of Democratic candidates -- governors, state legislators and members of the House and Senate, as well as Mr. Gore -- and has raised some $97 million.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Clinton also regularly makes the case for Mr. Gore's election, often going at Gov. George W. Bush of Texas more aggressively than the vice president himself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Siewert said it would be up to the Gore campaign to determine whether the president ought to shift his attention from late-night fund-raising events, like the ones he did tonight for Democrats around Boston, to daytime rallies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000

  For now, it appears that Mr. Gore -- who avoided any mention of the president during the three presidential debates -- wants to go it alone.

  ''This is a campaign that I am running on my own,'' Mr. Gore said in an interview on the NBC program  ''Today.'' ''And as I've said on previous occasions, I am who I am. I'm running in my own right with my own vision about the future of our country.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000

 <textdata>
  Asked if he was counting on help from Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore suggested that the president might be busy with other things in the closing days of his presidency.

  ''The Congress is still in session,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The leadership of the Congress on the Republican side has not been able to finish its business this year. A number of appropriations bills have still not been passed, weeks after the deadline. They are hard at work there. And of course, the particular challenges of foreign policy now are ones that command continuing attention.''

  The salary for a Texas governor last year was $115,345, but Mr. Bush relinquished 55 days of pay because he was out of the state campaigning, lowering his state salary to $97,964, his office said last April when the couple made a $50,000 payment on their tax bill and filed for an automatic four-month extension to file their tax return.
 </textdata>

  Bush Would Reshape NATO And Recast Nations' Roles  If elected president, George W. Bush plans to tell NATO that the United States should no longer participate in peacekeeping in the Balkans, signaling a major new division of labor in the Western alliance, according to his senior national security aide, Condoleezza Rice. Peacekeeping in Bosnia and Kosovo, and possibly elsewhere, would be a European responsibility. The United States would focus on deterring and fighting wars in the Persian Gulf, Asia and other distant trouble spots.

  ''Over the last eight years of the Clinton-Gore administration,'' Mr. Lieberman said, ''we have come to understand that what we can do begins with being fiscally responsible, that when government balances its books, it not only stops draining capital out of the markets because it's in hock, but it creates a sense of confidence generally, and that is one of the conditions for growth.''

  Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Lieberman, his running mate, have signaled that they will make prosperity their core issue in the final push toward the election on Nov. 7. But Mr. Lieberman's remarks were a continuing reflection of the ticket's  publicly split personality regarding President Clinton and his legacy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has tried to distance himself from his partner of the last eight years, and he and Mr. Lieberman frequently say they want to be judged more on their plans for the future than on the record of the past. But the vice president clearly wants to take credit for the good times, although without mentioning Mr. Clinton by name -- a task that more often falls to Mr. Lieberman.

  ''We've gone from the largest deficits in America, the federal government has, now to the largest surpluses,'' the senator said here in remarks to employees of FreeMarkets Inc., an Internet auction house for businesses. ''It started right in '93. The Clinton-Gore administration said, 'We're going to get serious about coming out of debt; here's our budget proposals that are controversial.' It passed without a single Republican vote; Al Gore had to break the tie in the Senate. And it turned the corner.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Speaking at FreeMarkets and at a senior citizens' center here, the senator argued that while Mr. Gore's proposed tax cuts and spending plans fit comfortably within the projected government surpluses of the next decade, Gov. George W. Bush's would mean a return to deficit spending.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Lieberman's visit here, and appearances he plans in the Philadelphia area on Sunday night and Monday, attest to the tightness of the race and a growing worry in the Gore camp. A month ago, polls indicated that Pennsylvania was solidly for Mr. Gore. But even as Mr. Bush has pulled slightly ahead in most national surveys, this state once again appears to be a toss-up in need of the Democrats' cultivation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As Mr. Lieberman visited an Internet company today, so did the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney. At Intranet Solutions Inc. of Eden Prairie, Minn., a Minneapolis suburb, Mr. Cheney told more than 100 employees that Mr. Bush's economic plans would do more to help ''the rising generation'' of 18- to 34-year-olds who work there.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For a person in his 30's, Mr. Cheney said, the Bush proposal allowing workers to divert part of their Social Security taxes into private accounts  could mean an extra $150,000 by retirement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Noting that he and Mr. Bush had both held leadership posts outside government, Mr. Cheney called Mr. Gore's approach ''old school'' and said the vice president's proposals were ''diametrically opposed'' to the guiding principles of the ''new economy.''
 </textdata>

  Do we want to see the country moving forward? Do we want to keep the prosperity going -- which Al Gore and I believe we're best able to do, and not only to keep the prosperity going but do it in a way, through better education and some of the tax incentives I've talked about, to expand the winner's circle to more of America's families? Or do we want to go back?''

  If elected president, George W. Bush plans to tell NATO that the United States should no longer participate in peacekeeping in the Balkans, signaling a major new division of labor in the Western alliance, according to Mr. Bush's senior national security aide.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's plan would represent the most important revision of NATO tasks since the cold war. His aides say the change is long overdue and would let the American military concentrate its training and financing on traditional combat missions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In outlining the approach, Ms. Rice was providing the strategic rationale behind many of Mr. Bush's general comments in the campaign about using American military power and his repeated contentions that extended peacekeeping missions and humanitarian operations had undermined military readiness. In sharp contrast, his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has said that if anything, Washington should take a more active role in using troops to prevent conflicts abroad.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Rice acknowledged that revising NATO's military tasks was delicate. Although Mr. Bush plans to make the redivision of military tasks a major objective, if elected, he plans to consult the Europeans and is not planning ''precipitous'' actions.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  American policy toward the Balkans has a tortured history. When President Clinton ran for office in 1992, he complained that the Bush administration had stayed on the sidelines as the Serbs turned Bosnia into a killing ground. But in office, the Clinton administration was initially slow to act.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the campaign, Mr. Gore has taken a similar stance. For him, Balkan peacekeeping is one of NATO's primary tasks and an example of the operation that the American military needs to undertake to support American diplomacy in the post-cold-war world.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In addition to deterring and fighting wars, Mr. Gore says, the armed forces should prepare for peacekeeping missions, delivering relief supplies and rebuilding institutions in war-ravaged nations, activities that the Pentagon calls nation building.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To help the military carry out such a broad array of tasks, Mr. Gore says, he would earmark $80 billion of the federal surplus for military programs over 10 years. An additional $20 billion would be spent on international programs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush says he would spend $45 billion of the surplus on the military over 10 years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The linchpin of our policy is forward engagement,'' said Gordon Adams, a senior adviser to Mr. Gore on military issues and a former top Clinton administration budget official. ''We have a wide range of instruments to deal with the problems, diplomatic, economic and military.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If you say you can use everything except the military, you have deprived yourself of one of those instruments. The Bush team has a curiously old-fashioned view. We will have a well-funded military that is designed to go nowhere and prepared do nothing, because they are only there to fight the nation's wars, and we are not having any.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has contended that the military has been run ragged by peacekeeping and humanitarian work, missions that are taking a toll on morale and readiness.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although Mr. Bush does not oppose all involvement in peacekeeping, he and his advisers say prolonged peacekeeping operations make it more difficult for the armed forces to prepare for major wars.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The United States would continue to provide intelligence, help with communications, transport and do other logistical work after withdrawing its peacekeeping troops. In outlining that approach, aides to Mr. Bush have in mind East Timor, where an Australian-led peacekeeping mission received United States logistical support. Although East Timor represents one possible approach for Mr. Gore, it seems be the main model for Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000

  Some also said Mr. Bush's program might give impetus to Europeans' efforts to develop their own military arrangements, perhaps more of a stimulus than Washington might like, given its goal to influence security policy in Europe.

  Reflecting Mr. Greenspan's stature as the very embodiment of prosperity -- and clearly sensitive to any suggestion that they might exert political influence on the central bank -- both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have stressed their desire for continuity at the Fed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president would be ''inclined to ask Greenspan to serve again'' when his current term expires, said Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Fed governor who is Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said that Mr. Bush was dedicated to protecting the Fed's independence and that he had been an early proponent of reappointing Mr. Greenspan to his current term.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Should Mr. Greenspan leave, a President Gore could turn to Lawrence H. Summers, the current Treasury Secretary, or to a candidate from within the central bank, like William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, is another possible candidate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush might look first to his current economic advisers, who in addition to Mr. Lindsey include Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard University, Michael Boskin of Stanford University and John B. Taylor of Stanford, one of the leading academic authorities on monetary policy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000

  ''There's a quasi-ideological divide between people who think consumer protection legislation is a good idea, a worthwhile function of the government in general and the Fed in particular, and those who think it's not,'' Mr. Blinder said. ''A Bush presidency versus a Gore presidency could make a difference there.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By contrast, President George Bush's administration openly criticized the Fed at times. Some of the former president's aides blame Mr. Greenspan for the elder Bush's loss to Mr. Clinton in 1992, saying the Fed did not cut rates early or aggressively enough to bring the economy out of recession starting in 1990.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Lindsey said Governor Bush ''is a great believer in the political independence of the Fed.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Democrats are happy to suggest that Governor Bush has not yet proved that he can resist the temptation to meddle with the Fed and that his family history with the central bank cannot be ignored.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Giving the Fed a wide berth ''would continue to be the policy of a Gore administration,'' Mr. Blinder said. ''I'm less confident it would be the policy of a Bush administration.''

  A SURPRISE OF THE SEASON  Minnesota, the state of Hubert H. Humphrey, Eugene J. McCarthy and Walter F. Mondale, which has gone Democratic in every presidential election since 1972, is suddenly too close to call. A poll published yesterday by The Star Tribune of Minneapolis showed Gov. George W. Bush slightly ahead of Vice President Al Gore. (''That's no misprint,'' the newspaper felt compelled to note.) The poll questioned 814 likely voters from last Saturday through Wednesday and found Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore by 44 percent to 41 percent. Although that lead was within the 3.4-percentage-point margin of sampling error, Dick Cheney, who happened to be in the Minneapolis area, seized on the news. Holding aloft the paper's banner headline, ''Bush snatches lead from Gore,'' he said he had called Bush campaign headquarters to declare: ''Check Minnesota into our column. We personally have delivered this state.''

  NADER, NUDGED, SAYS NO  A dozen old Nader's Raiders are urging Ralph Nader to reassess his presidential campaign, saying he could cost Vice President Al Gore the election. Mr. Nader's support is some 3 percent to 4 percent in most national polls, causing some Democrats to fear that he could win enough votes in some close states to push them into the Bush column. ''It is now clear that you might well give the White House to Bush,'' the group wrote in an open letter to Mr. Nader yesterday. ''As a result, you would set back significantly the social progress to which you have devoted your entire, astonishing career.'' The group, Nader's Raiders for Gore, accused him of reneging on a promise to campaign only in states where his candidacy would not hurt Mr. Gore's chances.His press secretary, Laura Jones, rejected the appeal. ''There are always a few,'' she said, ''who lose their zest and will to fight for progressive ideas and settle for moderate conservatives like Al Gore.''

Mr. Bush responded: ''Of course it does. If you pay taxes, you're going to get a benefit.'' Mr. Lehrer did not ask whether the proposal would benefit ''mainly'' that group.

  By the ordinary logic of politics, the vice president of an administration that has given us the greatest prosperity in history should be way ahead in this election. That he is not is a tribute to the campaigning skill of George W. Bush. No one can doubt any longer that Mr. Bush is a formidable candidate.

  When they were debating a patients' bill of rights, for example, and Governor Bush was asked the difference between the candidates, he answered, ''Well, the difference is that I can get it done.'' That ducked the real issue of what the ''it'' was -- what such legislation should include -- and obscured the fact that he did not support the meaningful bill pending in Congress.

  Asked whether he would support a law barring job discrimination against gays and lesbians, Governor Bush replied, ''I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation.'' That is no doubt true, admirable -- and irrelevant to the question of legislation. As to that, he said gays and lesbians should not have ''special rights'': code words used by those who oppose equal rights legislation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His reason for avoiding questions of that kind is plain. Governor Bush's slogan is that he is a ''compassionate conservative,'' so he does not want to look unsympathetic to people who face discrimination or who are treated unfairly by medical insurance companies. But he also does not want to offend the Christian right or the insurance companies.

  A questioner in the third debate said Governor Bush ''seemed to overly enjoy'' the fact that Texas led the nation in executions. Mr. Bush said his job in the execution process was ''to ask two questions, sir. Is the person guilty of the crime? And did the person have full access to the courts of law? And I can tell you, looking at you right now, in all cases those questions were answered in the affirmative.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That is the position that Governor Bush has consistently taken. It just happens to be untrue. The way Texas provides lawyers for capital defendants is notoriously unfair. People have been convicted and sentenced to death after trials in which their lawyers were drunk or asleep -- and the courts of Texas have found no error in that outrage.
 </textdata>

  When faced in the debates with particular facts about problems like Social Security or taxes, Governor Bush scorned them as ''Washington fuzzy math.'' But he is the master of fuzzy rhetoric.

  Al Gore's proposals are a step in the right direction, but stop short of endorsing a full solution. George W. Bush's plan is economic nonsense -- his proposed tax cut is inconsistent with his plan to move workers, through individual investment accounts, to a funded basis.

  As a political science student, I've been taught that in government, details can be very important. The article mentioned the ''unusually well-qualified people'' Mr. Bush has appointed. It must be those people who pay attention to all the details.

  The article also mentioned how Mr. Bush's visiting with lawmakers helped to pass a great deal of legislation. Mr. Bush's personality has taken him very far.

  No other race in the nation -- including the one by Al Gore to succeed him -- has commanded as much of Mr. Clinton's attention, and drawn as much of his time and concern, the president's friends say. While aides to Mrs. Clinton say the intensity of Mr. Clinton's involvement varies from day to day, depending on the pull of his other duties, his influence is felt as much as anyone's at her headquarters, save for that of the candidate herself.

  ''The job of protecting our children falls to us -- as parents,'' Mr. Bush said this morning in an address to several hundred supporters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ''Yet we want to know that our government is on our side. We want to live in a society that supports our values and upholds our authority. We need allies, not adversaries. Schools that form character. A decent public culture. And leaders who set a good example.''

  After his speech, Mr. Bush flew to Illinois, en route to Florida, where the campaign has become highly competitive. He was greeted here by a crowd chanting, ''No more Gore.'' A warm-up speaker, State Representative Lee Daniels, attacked the character of President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, saying, ''We are sick and tired of the lies and the immorality and the exaggeration.''

  Mr. Bush pushed his $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax-cut proposal, dismissing Mr. Gore's criticisms in the first presidential debate that the plan would give too much to the wealthy. ''He loves pitting people against people,'' he told the cheering crowd. ''You can't lead the nation by dividing people into groups.''

  Robert Weiner, the spokesman for General McCaffrey, said Mr. Bush was using ''ancient numbers.''

  To fight drugs, Mr. Bush proposed a series of grants, including $25 million for nonprofit groups that teach parents drug prevention, $25 million to groups that help small businesses fight drug use in the workplace, $350 million for community antidrug coalitions, and $100 million to expand a federal school antidrug program.

  CLEARWATER, Fla., Oct. 6 (By The New York Times) -- Gov. George W. Bush tonight seized on the events leading to the fall of Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia as vindication of his statement during the presidential debate that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia should enter the diplomatic effort ''and convince Mr. Milosevic it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000

  In his response, Vice President Al Gore said that since Russia had not yet recognized Vohislav Kostunica as the winner of elections, ''I'm not sure that it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this dispute.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000

 <textdata>
  With the Russians recognizing Mr. Kostunica today, Mr. Bush said it turned out that President Clinton had been in touch with Mr. Putin about the situation in Yugoslavia before the debate. News reports had mentioned conversations between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin before the debate, but Mr. Bush did not cite them until today.

  Well, that was Tuesday. By Wednesday it was clear that there hasn't been this much hype for a flop show since the Olympics. The first great debate didn't make or break anything except the viewer's patience. No Bush malapropisms. No over-the-top Gore attacks. No eloquence. Not only was this no Kennedy-Nixon, it wasn't even Bentsen-Quayle. And the audience? A mere 46 million, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's prediction, echoed everywhere, including The Times, was off by 50 percent.

  Still, I wouldn't have missed the debate for anything. Though it added exactly zero to our knowledge of either Al Gore or George W. Bush, it is a keeper for any time capsule of America 2000. At a cultural moment when many voters are forced constantly to make that hard choice between the Gap and Banana Republic, what is more apt than the spectacle of two princely boomers in identical outfits hypothesizing about how to spend a surplus of infinitely elastic trillions that both assume will last indefinitely? Now that branding and marketing are the national ideology -- and focus groups have a clout unmatched by labor unions or the religious right -- what could be more fitting than a debate in which not a single word is uttered that hasn't been pre-tested more rigorously than a McDonald's breakfast sandwich rollout?

  There was almost a Platonic perfection to the event's complete insulation from even the possibility of spontaneity, let alone the rude intrusion of present-day reality. You could watch all 90 minutes -- I'm not sure too many did -- and never know of bloodshed in the Middle East, or of a drug war run amok, or of an America populated by anyone other than the elderly and schoolchildren. The only comic relief was not Mr. Bush's lame jokes (by the same hand that wrote his wisecrack about David Letterman's open-heart surgery?) but both candidates' response to Jim Lehrer's question of how they might respond to an economic crisis. These are men who have never known bad times; neither had an answer. In this sense, too, the debate encapsulated a boom in which hardship is for many forgetful Americans only a theoretical possibility.

  Though Mr. Bush is fond of boasting that he's a man of principle, not ''polling and focus groups,'' he was just as scripted as his opponent -- no small feat. Mr. Gore's hit parade of tested buzz words and phrases -- ''middle class'' (10 mentions), ''wealthiest  1 percent'' (10), ''lockbox'' (7) -- was nearly matched by Mr. Bush's Pavlovian references to bringing ''Republicans and Democrats'' together (9) and ''fuzzy'' math (4). There were five times when the governor tried to prove his credentials as a leader by telling us what governors do, as in the ''governor is the chief executive officer and learns how to set agendas,'' and ''governors are oftentimes found on the front line of catastrophic situations.'' While Mr. Bush may spare us Mr. Gore's insufferable, schoolmarmish tone, his ''affable'' alternative is to speak to us as if we've all been held back together with him in grade school.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even more revealing was what polling and focus groups told the two men not to say. Mr. Bush won't use the word ''vouchers'' (though he's in favor of them) or ''impeachment'' (though he was presumably in favor of that too). In a real debate, surely the Texas governor would bring up the signature issue of his party for the past four years, and Mr. Gore's contemporaneous contention that Bill Clinton ''will be regarded in the history books as one of our greatest presidents.'' But no. Polling says that any criticism of an opponent will be perceived by Oprah-fied women as a ''personal attack,'' so even Mr. Bush's mention of the Buddhist temple arrived tentatively, late in the game.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore is just as cautious. The Texas governor presents himself as a guardian of education and health care, but if you turn to his own campaign's official Web site, you'll find that his so-called rebuttals of embarrassing facts about his Texas -- 48th in per-capita spending for public health and 41st in per-capita spending on public education, first in uninsured children -- rely on fuzzy, often bogus comparisons and irrelevant math. But like the Clinton presidency, Mr. Bush's Texas record is off-limits because polling shows that an attack on an opponent's public record is now also considered ''personal.''

  Since both men are so straitjacketed by self-censorship, how could the debate have possibly advanced the story line? It's the bland leading the bland. No wonder that the soporific vice-presidential sequel was widely overpraised by contrast -- the guys at least sounded like free-speaking human beings. (And give Dick Cheney bonus points for being the only man on either ticket not to wear a red tie and white shirt.) No wonder, too, that young voters ignore debates, skip elections and seek out an alternative culture where people say what they mean. A steady diet of Bush-Gore could drive anyone to Eminem.

  With the exception of Dan Rather -- who alone among TV heavies had the guts to pronounce the presidential face-off ''pedantic, dull, unimaginative, lackluster, humdrum, you pick the word'' -- the bloviators were as rigid in analyzing the debate as its combatants were in waging it. They focused on the twin plot lines that had been hyped in advance -- would Gore be too mean? would Bush commit a gaffe? -- and adjudicated the ''winner'' accordingly. (Since neither man committed the predicted sins, the verdicts were vague and divided.) Much as some at first missed the significance of Rick Lazio's paper-wielding stunt in his debate with Hillary Clinton, male pundits may have underrated the one moment in the Bush-Gore debate that might actually have moved some of those undecided suburban swing-state women voters said to hold the Electoral College's key.
 </textdata>

  The moment came when Mr. Bush told a Gore-like whopper, fudging his previous stand in favor of trying to thwart the F.D.A.'s approval of RU-486, the abortion pill. Planned Parenthood polling shows that undecided Republican and independent women in states like Florida, Michigan and Missouri are disproportionately pro-choice and disproportionately likely to choose a candidate on that issue -- but that many of them don't yet know that Mr. Bush is both anti-choice and (despite his professed desire to make abortion ''more rare'') hostile to family planning. The Bush campaign has no doubt seen similar polling, as evidenced not only by its man's evasive debate answer but also by his decision a week earlier to announce his initial stand against RU-486 by press release rather than on camera.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000

 <textdata>
  Otherwise, there was no discernible movement -- nor could there be. Mr. Bush remains a conventional anti-tax, small-government Republican with the hard-right edges sanded down; Mr. Gore remains a conventional Democratic believer in governmental activism, though with any traces of leftist grandiosity muted into earth tones. G.O.P.-lite, Democrat-lite: For the 95 percent of the country unwilling to go for Ralph Nader or Pat Buchanan, that is the choice, it always has been the choice, and it will still be the choice on Nov. 7. Dueling prescription-drug plans -- both likely to be folded into a compromise by a divided Congress anyway -- hardly alter the equation. And if character counts most, that, too, isn't changing. Mr. Bush is still an entitled, hail-fellow-well-met American blueblood who has coasted through life with the right name and its attendant connections. Mr. Gore is still the overcalculating child of the expediencies of Washington, where no principle is written in stone for longer than a polling cycle.

  The only hope for a real shake-up in this tale is a true October surprise that can't be greeted with pre-fab language -- perhaps a shocking F.B.I. resolution to the question of who mailed a Bush debate preparation tape to the Gore camp. (Please say it wasn't Wen Ho Lee.) Short of that, much of the audience will skip the next two exchanges of rehearsed sound bites between the candidates, no matter how much they are hyped as ''make or break.'' There's no need to settle for reruns now that there's a new season of ''The West Wing.''

  The Republicans responded in kind. ''The single biggest cause for the decline in federal employment is cutbacks at the Pentagon,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Gov. George W.

''It gives a wrongful impression to the American people to suggest that the government is shrinking when it is the Defense Department that is shrinking.''

  Jim Lehrer asked Mr. Bush how he would go about deciding when it was in the national interest to use U.S. force abroad. He replied that it must be ''in our vital national interests,'' and he went on to define the phrase.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That careful definition pointedly excluded what has been the most notable mission of U.S. troops abroad in recent years: to prevent continuing genocide by Slobodan Milosevic's forces in Bosnia and Kosovo -- places that have not been considered within America's ''vital national interests.'' Earlier this year Governor Bush said explicitly that ''we should not send our troops to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide in nations outside our strategic interest.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush went on in the debate to indicate that our soldiers should be withdrawn from some places where they are now stationed. And he denounced what he called ''nation-building'' as a mission.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  From what places would Mr. Bush now withdraw U.S. forces? Someone really should ask him. Japan? Korea? The NATO countries? The Persian Gulf? Kosovo, where he in fact supported President Clinton's intervention? Bosnia?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, Bosnia is the example that shows how tragically mistaken the Bush policy would be. Mr. Milosevic sent his thugs into Bosnia in 1992 as part of his strategy to distract Serbs' attention by playing on nationalism -- a strategy that also took him into Croatia and Kosovo.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Why should Governor Bush ignore those realities and lay down constricting principles for the American role in the world? There may be an element of loyalty to his father, who as president did nothing to stop Mr. Milosevic when he began his rampage; but I cannot believe that is the major reason. More likely it is an attempt to appeal to one particular slice of conservative opinion: a contemporary version of isolationism.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000

 <textdata>
  But perhaps George W. Bush really believes that an American president should turn his eyes away from genocide in Europe. That is an alarming possibility, in a world dependent on American leadership.

  Mr. Perry, a 50-year-old Republican, is also wearing something that might surprise quite a few people in Texas political circles: the calm demeanor of a man seemingly without worries despite good reason to have a few. He is not actually up for election this November, but his political future is hip-locked to the presidential fortunes of Gov. George W. Bush. If Mr. Bush wins, Mr. Perry will become governor and a likely front-runner in the 2002 gubernatorial election; a Bush defeat would leave him in that corner office with the prospects of a far tougher race in 2002.

  Mr. Perry expresses complete confidence that Mr. Bush will win but in any case claims to lose no sleep dwelling on what happens if he doesn't. ''I don't pay a lot of attention to the 'what ifs,' '' he said, an outlook that places him in a tiny minority in Austin.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But no matter what happens on Election Day, Mr. Perry will emerge as one of the most powerful figures in Texas, either as a new governor with a friend in the White House or as a powerful lieutenant governor with a lame-duck governor, since Mr. Bush has said he will not run again anyway. So, as Mr. Bush campaigns across the nation, Mr. Perry is in the midst of a different sort of campaign, quietly introducing himself to a Texas public that barely knows his name.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In recent months, Mr. Perry has raised his political profile, though not always as intended. He technically runs the state during Mr. Bush's frequent absences, which means he has presided over executions, offered disaster relief after tornadoes hit Fort Worth and, most of all, kept the government running smoothly. He has also provided political help for Mr. Bush at key moments, offering public support when the governor was being pilloried for the execution of Gary Graham or when cost overruns were discovered in the state budget.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Should Mr. Bush win in November, Mr. Perry promises, there will be few changes in governing philosophy here in Austin. He does say he will focus attention on higher education (Mr. Bush has concentrated on K through 12) and on improving state highways. And, in a year when capital punishment in Texas has come under heavy outside criticism, he rules out a moratorium on executions but suggests that lawmakers will address ''a number of issues'' including DNA testing and ensuring that indigent defendants receive competent legal counsel.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Of course, any discussion of a Perry administration could be premature, particularly if Mr. Bush loses in November. The conventional political wisdom in Texas is that another Republican, the popular Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, will stay in Washington if Mr. Bush wins. But she is said to be considering a run for governor in 2002 if he loses. Politicians agree that she would be a formidable opponent for Mr. Perry in a Republican primary, possibly even a favorite. Mr. Perry calls her ''my friend'' and none too subtly counsels that she remain in Washington, in the best interests of the state.
 </textdata>

  One thing is certain: Mr. Bush is far from the only person in Texas with his future on the line this Nov. 7.

  Report Questions Federal Surpluses  A Congressional Budget Office study on federal budget surpluses warned that although the fiscal outlook for the next decade or so is bright, and getting brighter, the picture over the longer run remains troubled. In setting their agendas, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are counting on nearly $4.6 trillion in projected surpluses. [A11.]

  And former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, who campaigned with Mr. Cheney today, charged that Mr. Gore's decision to break with his party and support the resolution in favor of the gulf war -- which the vice president cites as an example of his independence of mind and principled approach to governing -- was motivated not by patriotism but by a desire to get publicity. Mr. Simpson called Mr. Gore the ''provocative prevaricator of our times.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000

 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign said the charges were groundless. ''Dick Cheney is back on the attack because they lost the debate on the issues,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore campaign spokesman. ''When the facts are inconvenient for the Bush campaign, they resort to these kinds of attacks.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Simpson leveled what might be the most damaging charge: that in 1991 Mr. Gore had sold his vote supporting the gulf war to get more time on television. Mr. Simpson charged -- as former Senator Bob Dole did in the 1992 election -- that Mr. Gore negotiated with both Democrats and Republicans to see who would give him more speaking time in the debate on the floor of the Senate before casting his vote. ''He had simply decided to support the side that gave him the most time at prime time,'' Mr. Simpson said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Hattaway denied the charge. ''Al Gore broke with his own party and voted to support the gulf war because it was the right thing to do,'' he said. ''Simpson's claim is absolutely false and obviously politically motivated.'' Appropriating a line that the Bush campaign uses against Mr. Gore, Mr. Hattaway said, ''Bush's supporters will obviously say anything to get him elected.''

  For 90 minutes, America put its best foot forward. Joseph I. Lieberman and Dick Cheney allowed me to forget about Al Gore and George W. Bush. Instead of watching a split-screen debate filled with sighs, head-shaking, scowls and blank stares, I watched an honorable exchange on the issues.

  Gentility of Debate Hid Weapons Under the Table  Strategists on both sides said the decision to hold to a more courtly tone in the vice-presidential debate was made on the fly, by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and Dick Cheney, though each had been prepared to respond if the other attacked. While some of the 28.5 million television viewers confessed to being slightly bored with a thoughtful, informative debate free of rancor and with minimal posturing, others said they were left feeling braced. But the debate did not appear to have changed many minds, nor did strategists think it would influence the two remaining debates between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush.

  The ''other two'' are Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, their parties' presidential nominees, who clashed in the campaign's first debate in Boston on Tuesday night, and Mrs. Obando was hardly alone in thinking that the leading men had been outclassed by their running mates.

  To many viewers, the easy cordiality of Mr. Cheney, the former defense secretary, and Mr. Lieberman, the Connecticut senator, reflected poorly on the combative tone of the first presidential debate, particularly on Mr. Gore's exaggerated diction and aggressive bids to have the last word. Some found that Mr. Cheney's authoritative answers, particularly on foreign policy and national security, underscored the thinness of Mr. Bush's responses in those areas.

  Strategists on each side said they were ready for -- even half-expected -- a debate nearly as rough as the one between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, who will face each other twice more. The decision to hold to a more courtly tone, they said, was made on the fly, by the candidates themselves.

  An aide to Mr. Cheney said the decision to keep the debate cordial and issue-oriented was the way Mr. Cheney wanted to turn the discussion. The Bush campaign was also pleased with the result, which Cheney aides said they viewed as beneficial in the long run because they expected that it played well with independents and swing voters who were tired of finger-pointing and name-calling.

  Aides said Mr. Cheney preferred to use his time in the debate laying out the Bush campaign's proposals on taxes, Social Security and education.

And with Mr. Bush's brother Jeb as the governor and leader of a strong political machine here, no one is counting the Republicans out. But the Gore campaign is making increasing investments here with the candidate's time and the campaign's money, two of the strongest indications that Mr. Gore perceives an opening in Florida that could catapult him to the White House.

  The conventional wisdom is that Mr. Gore can win the election without Florida but that Mr. Bush cannot. Of the populous states, Mr. Gore appears to have California and New York in his pocket, and probably Pennsylvania and Illinois. Mr. Bush can count on Texas, but beyond that, Ohio is the next-biggest state where he is slightly ahead, and that lead appears tenuous. Without Florida, Mr. Bush has a hard time gathering enough electoral votes to put him over the top. With Florida, Mr. Gore could win in an electoral landslide.

  Mr. Gore spent four days in Florida just last week, when he prepared for the first presidential debate. And he is planning to return in a couple of days for another four-day preparation session for the next debate, scheduled for Wednesday in North Carolina.

  Polls here and nationally give Mr. Gore a decided edge with voters older than 65. In Florida, one in three voters is over 65, and Mr. Gore highlighted several subjects of interest to older voters today. For one thing, he said that Mr. Bush would bankrupt Social Security.
 </textdata>

  ''We give you a generous incentive to save and invest, not at the expense of Social Security but on top of Social Security, so that you can set aside money without putting at risk the basic safety net that Social Security represents,'' Mr. Gore said.

  Both presidential campaigns are advertising heavily here, and with the competition keen for some state and local races, watching television here is like watching one long nonstop political commercial.

  Ms. MacManus, for one, said that the key for Mr. Gore would be a strong turnout among blacks, who accounted for 10 percent of the vote in the 1996 presidential election.

  That makes the black vote even more important this year. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has already devoted $400,000 for get-out-the-vote efforts in Florida, and Gore aides say more efforts will be made.

 <textdata>
  ON THE SCREEN -- A serene-looking Mr. Bush in an open-neck shirt speaks directly to the camera. Interspersed are portraits of the governor interacting with workers, young children and businesspeople, each episode intended to underline one of the issues the spot highlights.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000

 <textdata>
  SCRIPT -- Mr. Bush: ''I believe we need to encourage personal responsibility so people are accountable for their actions. And I believe in government that is responsible to the people.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ACCURACY -- The positions outlined are restatements of policies that Mr. Bush has been emphasizing for months. Speaking here in the most general terms, the governor makes another pitch for his proposal to allow workers to take charge of the investment of some of their Social Security money. He also promotes his plan for broad-based tax cuts, a platform that has been attacked by Vice President Al Gore as overwhelmingly favoring the wealthiest 1 percent of the population. Though the federal government has little direct control over education, Mr. Bush says once again that he will demand greater accountability from schools in return for federal aid. And the declaration about giving parents ''different options'' seems a veiled reference to his support for charter schools and school vouchers, the latter a politically charged phrase he has stopped using of late.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  SCORECARD -- The Bush campaign rather cleverly uses Mr. Bush's stands on the issues to demonstrate he is a man of character. The governor uses the word trust six times in the spot, and it also materializes on the screen. (''Trust'' is, in fact, the title of the spot.) It is no accident that the nominee himself invokes the name of his opponent -- a rarity for Bush commercials. The idea he seems to want to convey in this thematic comparison is that only one candidate in the race is truly a man of his word.

  Vouchers, first proffered by the economist Milton Friedman in a 1955 essay, are among the most divisive issues in education, a critical point of dissension between this year's two major presidential candidates. Vice President Al Gore, who has been endorsed by the teachers unions, shares their adamant opposition to vouchers of any kind. Gov. George W. Bush has proposed allowing parents of children in failing schools to take $1,500 in federal money and use it for any education purpose, including private-school tuition, but has avoided the word voucher.

  This solid relationship is often tested by election-year politics. Mr. Clinton must consider the needs of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Mr. Hastert, who seldom speaks with Gov. George W.

Mr. Bush's success or failure could play a pivotal role in whether Republicans keep control of the House.

  KING -- Congressman Franks, in the presidential debate last week, Al Gore criticized the tax cut proposed by George W. Bush, saying it was too large and that more than 40 percent of the dollars would go to the richest 1 percent of the population. Do you share those concerns, and would you vote for the Bush tax cut package?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  FRANKS -- I do share some of those concerns, and I would not vote for the Bush tax cut package as it is today. I'm concerned that it would crowd out other compelling priorities. This nation should first meet the obligations that we've already pledged. We need to save Social Security. We need to save Medicare. We need to continue to pay down the national debt. We need to first honor the commitments we've already made.

  CORZINE -- Well, this is one of the most important issues for comparison of Congressman Franks and myself. Last -- this month, in New Jersey Business Week -- or Monthly -- he proposed that we eliminate the capital gains tax. He talked about across-the-board tax cuts. He talked about the marriage penalty proposal that he's talked about, which actually is a new way of providing tax cuts for high-income folks, in addition to the folks that do deserve marriage penalty relief, and an elimination of the inheritance tax. If you add all those up and just divide by two what Governor Bush's proposal is with regard to tax cuts on an across-the-board basis, you come up to 1.8 trillion in tax cuts. That will foreclose anyone from having the ability to invest in our education, protect our environment, our health care, shore up Medicare, all of the things that I think people want to see us invest in. . .

  Clinging to a position that would prevent America from developing some of the most promising of its domestic energy resources, Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman have repeatedly stated their opposition to oil exploration in a tiny sliver of the Arctic Coastal Plain. They say it would yield only a six-month supply of oil, and only at the cost of the destruction of a pristine wilderness. In suggesting that we must choose between Arctic oil and environmental protection, they are presenting a false choice.

  America will remain dependent on oil for the foreseeable future, and increasingly, our dependency is on foreign oil.

  Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman heralded the recent release of oil from our existing Strategic Petroleum Reserve as instrumental in easing prices and building inventories of heating oil. But they oppose looking for the oil field that many geologists think may be under Alaska's coastal plain -- a huge field that could have a meaningful and sustained effect on  consumer prices. We are flirting with danger by refusing even to see what may lie under the coastal plain.

I think she has had a distinguished career on the bench. And that's what, I think, a senator should look for when it comes to confirmation. And this is consistent with, frankly, what both Vice President Al Gore said and what Governor Bush said in their debates: look for the most experienced, qualified person. No litmus tests. Let's make sure we get somebody who has a healthy respect for precedent, who's got the ability to make good decisions, and who's got, hopefully, a good experience of being on the bench and having the temperament that we would want to have as somebody who's going to be serving on America's highest court.

  CLINTON -- Well, I think that the fate of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance in this election. If we take Governor Bush at his word, his two favorite justices are Scalia and Thomas, both of whom are committed to overturning Roe v. Wade, ending a woman's right to choose. I could not go along with that. In the Senate, I will be looking very carefully at the constitutional views that any nominee from, I hope, Vice President Gore, but in the event, unfortunately, President Bush, as to what that nominee believes about basic, fundamental constitutional rights. Just as I could not support a nominee who would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, I wouldn't support someone who would vote to overturn Brown v. Board of Education. . . .

  Any claim that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have to credit for the country's long run of prosperity dates to the evening of Aug. 6, 1993.

  Republicans, not one of whom voted for it, predicted that the legislation would choke what had been a fragile recovery from the 1990-91 recession. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore asserted that it would unlock the economy's potential by easing the pressure on interest rates, and they say history has proved them correct.

  But many economists say it is a considerable stretch to suggest, as Mr. Gore often does, that the powerful expansion of the 1990's was born with the passage of that plan.

  For one thing, they say, other policy decisions played a role in straightening out the government's finances. Among them were a deficit-reduction bill signed by President George Bush in 1990 and a deal between Mr. Clinton and the Republican Congress in 1997 that cut capital gains taxes while further restricting spending.

  Moreover, economists and business executives say, much of what happened to the economy in the 1990's had little to do with Washington and was part of a process that began before Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore took office.

  As Mr. Gore put it on Tuesday night, the ingenuity of the American people should get credit for the strong economy, but the American people also had plenty of ingenuity eight years ago when the economy was in the doldrums and the deficit was out of control.

  ''The difference is we've got a new policy,'' Mr. Gore said in the debate. At times he has been even more explicit about claiming the credit. ''I voted and we won and then we've had an economic recovery since then,'' he said in a speech on the economy late last year.

  But that emphasis, on attacking consumer demand in clinics and through education, was all but abandoned in the Reagan years and under President George Bush's drug czar, William J. Bennett, the film maintains. It portrays a rising right-wing effort to push federal policy futilely toward increasing reliance on strong-arm tactics: seizing shipments, smashing Latin American drug factories, sweeping the streets of dealers and filling jails with a disproportionate number of blacks.

  Republicans focused their attacks on Mr. Gore's misstatements of fact -- most recently, his statement in last Tuesday's debate that he had visited Texas during a period of wildfires with James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Gore has since acknowledged that he went to Texas not with the director of the agency, but with the deputy director.

  Two top Bush advisers -- Karl Rove, chief strategist, on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' and Karen P. Hughes, communications director, on ''Fox News Sunday'' -- called Mr. Gore ''a serial exaggerator.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is a man who has difficulty telling the truth,'' Mr. Rove said. ''He constantly exaggerates and embellishes.'' In the debate, he said, Mr. Gore had exaggerated ''about being at the Parker County fires.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000

  In fact, Mr. Gore had said in the debate, ''I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.'' He never said he went to Parker County or to the fires.

  Mr. Lieberman reminded viewers that Mr. Bush has had misstatements of his own, as when he cited ''The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' as a favorite childhood book -- though it was written when he was in his 20's. And he ripped into Mr. Bush's record as governor of Texas.

  He then flew to this beach resort near Sarasota, Fla., for three days of preparation for Wednesday night's debate with Mr. Bush in Winston-Salem, N.C., the second of their three scheduled encounters.

  But Mr. Gore's surrogates, including his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, and the Democratic National Committee's national chairman, Joe Andrew, will apparently feel little such restraint. And Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, made it clear in an interview that Gore aides do not feel bound by their candidate's pledge.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The governor will be held to presidential standards when it comes to describing his policy views,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''Thus far, he has not met the Quayle standard.'' That was a reference to former Vice President Dan Quayle, who was renowned for his verbal miscues while serving under Mr. Bush's father.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Similarly, Mark D. Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager, said on CNN's ''Late Edition'' today that Mr. Bush ''was incoherent -- he was babbling'' in trying to explain his own tax-cut proposal at a campaign stop Saturday in Florida.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Gore aides said the campaign had long planned to focus attention on Mr. Bush's record in the four weeks before the Nov. 7 election. But the timing takes on additional significance because of the continuing closeness of the race after the candidates' first debate last week and because of the Bush campaign's efforts to label Mr. Gore as a ''serial exaggerator.'' Those words were used today by Mr. Bush's chief strategist, Karl Rove, in an interview on CNN.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000

  The new Gore offensive will include Democratic National Committee television advertisements about Mr. Bush's record on health care and the environment. Several advertisements tailored to individual cities and states have been broadcast in selected markets in recent days.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In environmentally conscious Seattle, for instance, one commercial describes the smog in Houston and implores viewers to ''take a deep breath and imagine Seattle with Bush's Texas-style environmental regulation.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In addition, Mr. Lieberman will be dispatched to Texas for a ''failed leadership tour'' this week, and Mr. Andrew will hold a news conference on the subject here on Monday. Other surrogates, including members of Congress, also will be used, said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This is not a new role for Mr. Lieberman. He traveled to Houston in late September to attack Mr. Bush's environmental record at a park in the shadow of an oil refinery. Mr. Lieberman provided a preview today by faulting Mr. Bush's environmental and health care records in an interview on CNN. ''The fact is that George Bush's record on the environment in Texas is horrible,'' he said. ''They have the most toxically polluted air in America. Houston is the dirtiest city. Kids in Houston don't know whether they can go out to play every day until the school officials or the local officials check the air quality.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In addition to bringing attention to Mr. Bush's record on health care and the environment, the Gore surrogates are also expected to discuss Mr. Bush's approval of legislation permitting the carrying of concealed weapons in churches, hospitals and nursing homes, Gore aides said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign, according to aides, will issue regular press releases highlighting Mr. Bush's tortured syntax and will feature on its Web site video and audio of recent examples, like his disjointed description of his tax plan on Saturday. The Democratic National Committee is issuing similar releases by fax and e-mail messages, called ''Bush Lite,'' said Jennifer Backus, a party spokeswoman.

  For example, Mr. Gore has a plan for universal health care. George W. Bush has none. Mr. Gore has a program to pay down the $3.4 trillion national debt. Mr. Bush's budget and Social Security plans would leave the country unable to do so. It's that simple.

  All through the day, Mr. Bush broadly summed up the rationale for his election, portraying himself as a uniter who would ''bring America together'' to deal with the problems facing Social Security, Medicare and struggling schools. ''Our country has unlimited potential,'' Mr. Bush told a crowd of several thousand in an airport hangar in Albuquerque, where he stopped on his way to the West Coast. ''But our politics is broken -- at least in Washington.

  Mr. Bush's insistence that ''we can aim higher, we can do better'' was designed to contrast with the Democrats' end-of-campaign attacks on his record in Texas and his relative inexperience in national politics.

  10-31-2000

 <textdata>
  He said Mr. Gore's ''big government ideas'' were ''out of touch with our time and out of step with the American people.''

  Mr. Bush portrayed himself as a farsighted leader who would not shy away from fixing programs like Medicare and Social Security, which could run out of money in coming decades, and would change the lack of quality in some of the nation's public schools. ''Should I be elected president, I'm going to confront the hard issues,'' he said, ''from the inertia of our education bureaucracy to the third rail of Social Security. I won't take the easy way, the Washington way. I will act. And I will lead.''

  Even with most national polls showing Mr. Bush with a small lead, the Republican's decision to spend two of the final days of the race in California was not without risk. This is when a candidate's time is most precious, and appearances normally are carefully chosen for where they can do most good. And while several recent polls suggest that California is more competitive than expected, Mr. Gore is still holding leads ranging from 5 to 10 percentage points.

  But Mr. Bush has refused to give up on the nation's most populous state the way his father did in 1992 and Bob Dole did four years later.  ''The time for head fakes are long past,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director. ''We're serious.''

  Mr. Bush's stop in Burbank was built around a taping of the ''Tonight'' show with Jay Leno. At one point in the show, Mr. Leno donned a Bush mask and mispronounced the word ''subliminal.'' Mr. Bush promptly put on a Gore mask and said, ''This is more scary.''

  After the show, Mr. Bush went to Fresno, Calif., to try to generate enthusiasm among Republicans in the  Central Valley, a swing area. Mr. Bush also planned to sweep up the West Coast, through Oregon and Washington, where Democrats have prevailed in recent elections, before heading back to the Midwest.

  Mr. Gore, too, was to arrive here on Tuesday to appear on the ''Tonight'' show, and his aides dismissed Mr. Bush's challenge. ''We welcome Governor Bush to spend as much of his time and money in California as he wants,'' said Kym Spell, a Gore spokeswoman, ''because we feel very confident about where we stand on issues like the environment that are important to California.''

  Mr. Bush's speech in New Mexico was unusually long for a rally address and it summed up his closing appeal to voters, just eight days before the election. He painted himself as the antidote to politics as usual, and he drew contrasts with Mr. Gore on a range of issues, including education, Social Security, Medicare, tax cutting and the military.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush read the speech from a teleprompter, but that did not stop him from making a mistake and inverting his words. At one point, he thundered that Mr. Gore believes that the federal surplus ''is the people's money.'' He meant to say that Mr. Gore considers the surplus the ''government's money.''

  Mr. Bush's aides said that every day in this final week, Mr. Bush would highlight a particular theme of his campaign and today's was supposed to be education. But his off-the-cuff remarks at the Bosque Farms, N.M., elementary school were little more than a perfunctory rendition of his views on an issue on which he has run hard all year.

  At one point Mr. Bush appeared to be answering criticisms that Texas schools have put too much emphasis on preparing for standardized testing, compared with more meaningful instruction. ''I know you hear all the time about, well, you can't have accountability because teachers will teach to a test,'' he said. ''Here's my answer. Teaching a child to read, teaching a child to comprehend is not teaching to a test.''

  Dick Cheney struck back today at Democrats who questioned whether his running mate, Gov. George W.

  Mr. Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, made the accusation one day after his Democratic counterpart, Senator Joseph I.

  Mr. Cheney spent 25 years in government -- a year longer than Mr. Gore -- serving as President Gerald R. Ford's chief of staff, being elected six times as Wyoming's lone congressman, and as defense secretary in the Persian Gulf war. When President George Bush lost his bid for re-election in 1992, Mr. Cheney joined a research organization before taking the helm at  Halliburton, an oil services company.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Now, I'm proud of my national experience and public service,'' Mr. Cheney said here at Loras College. ''Al Gore and Joe Lieberman ought to be proud of their service, too, but I think it's rather limited, frankly. Neither one of 'em ever ran anything, neither one of 'em ever made a payroll, as best I can tell. And the world looks different if you've had to go out into the private sector.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Gore worked as a journalist for five years before becoming a congressman from Tennessee, and Mr. Lieberman was a lawyer in Connecticut before he became a senator. Mr. Cheney's running mate, Mr. Bush, worked in the oil industry and was a part-owner of the Texas Rangers before he became governor.

  The Gore campaign seemed to be happy to discuss which candidate is more qualified to be the president. ''Our problem with Governor Bush's experience is not the jobs he's had but how he's done them,'' said Kym Spell, a campaign spokeswoman. ''We have a problem when you promise a Texas miracle in education that turns out to be a myth, when you appoint polluters to run environmental agencies, and when you deliver tax cuts for big oil instead of insuring health care for children.''

  Liberal Democrats have begun an aggressive campaign to urge Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president, to endorse Vice President Al Gore in important swing states.

  The liberals say they have sharpened their once-polite attacks on Mr. Nader because they have given up any hope of persuading him to drop out of the race. Instead, they have begun warning Mr. Nader and his advisers that his legacy among Democrats on Capitol Hill and elsewhere will be one of bitter resentment if Mr. Gore loses narrowly to Gov. George W.

  A number of Democrats who have worked with Mr. Nader over the years said today that they had been calling their friends in Mr. Nader's inner circle, urging them to persuade Mr. Nader to throw his support behind Mr. Gore in closely contested states like Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin and New Mexico.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The idea would be to allow Mr. Nader to continue his push for 5 percent of the national vote -- which would entitle the Green Party to federal matching funds in 2004 -- while also helping Mr. Gore win enough electoral votes to defeat Mr. Bush.

  In response to a question about whether the election of Mr. Bush might lead to the overturning of the landmark case legalizing abortion, Mr. Nader said, ''Even if Roe vs. Wade is reversed, that doesn't end it. It just reverts it back to the states.''

  With help from the New York City Board of Elections, the producers of the Broadway play ''Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man' '' set up a real voting booth in the lobby of the Virginia Theater on Oct. 11. People attending the play could step in and pull levers for the candidates they preferred in the presidential campaign and the New York Senate race.

  What the Board of Elections lends, the Board of Elections takes away. It carted the voting machine off the other day to be used at a real polling place next week. But the producers kept track, and said that of 1,200 theatergoers who voted, 75 percent voted for Vice President Al Gore and 25 percent for Gov. George W. Bush. As for the Senate race, 68 percent chose Mrs. Clinton; 32 percent her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio.

  If she wins, she instantly wipes out her identity as Bill Clinton's wife and becomes a high-ranking elected official from a state he barely knows.

If Elizabeth Dole made the cut, there will be no way of keeping Senator Clinton off the list.

  Austin liberals admit they have still not adjusted to the surprise of Mr. Bush's winning the governorship. How did his low-key brand of amiable determination sneak up on them so?

  ''We're wondering whether he can pull it off,'' observed Cactus Pryor, a fervid Democrat and legendary Texas broadcaster for five decades.

  The Republicans' advertising outlays in California, more than $1.8 million for the week that ended on Oct. 24, went unmatched by the Democrats. In fact, the report released yesterday by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law said that since June 1, Gov. George W. Bush and the Republican Party had spent $5.5 million on television commercials in California, the country's most populous state. The Democrats and Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, have spent no money on television there.

  California surveys show Mr. Gore leading, though the race appears to have narrowed somewhat over the last month. Still, political analysts say that the advertising offensive by Mr. Bush, which has been concentrated in Southern California, has so far not made the contest particularly competitive.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There's no evidence that the advertising has made any difference in the chance of Bush pulling an upset,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey director of the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. ''Our latest poll showed the race had tightened, but even by our calculations we were unwilling to put California in the 'battleground state' category.''
 </textdata>

  The Brennan Center, working with a University of Wisconsin professor, Ken Goldstein, has been tracking advertising spending in the nation's top 75 media markets. In the crucial third week of October, the researchers found, Mr. Bush and the Republican National Committee spent $9.1 million on television, while Mr. Gore, the Democratic National Committee and outside groups like Planned Parenthood spent $7.2 million. Virtually no money was spent on commercials for Mr. Bush by special-interest groups, which have been concentrating on supporting Republican congressional candidates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While Mr. Bush's largest expenditure was in California, Mr. Gore put more of his resources in Florida than in any other state. Even so, Mr. Bush outspent him there for the week, $1.5 million to about $1 million.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Since June 1, Mr. Bush and the Republicans spent $65 million on television, and Mr. Gore, the Democrats and outside groups spent $61.6 million, the study said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The data also indicate that the 2000 presidential campaign is outstripping the 1996 race in sheer volume of advertising. Four years ago, viewers across the nation saw a total of 162,000 commercials, Mr. Goldstein said, adding that by Oct. 24 of this year, voters had already been exposed to 187,000 spots, evenly split between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  E. Joshua Rosenkranz, the Brennan Center's president, said the study further confirmed the expanding use of soft money, the unrestricted donations to the parties from corporations and wealthy individuals, to finance candidate advertising. Both the Democratic and Republican Parties, which can accept soft money, continue to outspend the Bush and Gore campaigns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But aides to Mr. Bush contend that the expenditures were intended to fulfill the campaign's promise to be a force in California. ''There was a commitment that we made to California early on, and that commitment was time and money,'' a top Bush adviser said. ''Plus, it's a 5- to 7-point race, so it's a good place for us to be.''

  There is little the Clinton administration has done or tried to do over the last eight years in which Mr. Gore has not played some role. From his early eagerness to cut budget deficits in 1993 to the aggressive fund-raising of the 1996 campaign to his role in the final days of the Kosovo conflict in 1999, Mr. Gore has been heard and, more often than not, heeded.

  There were stumbles, as well. Two of the worst came in the same month, March 1997, when Mr. Gore famously told a White House news conference that ''no controlling legal authority'' barred him from making telephone calls asking for Democratic political contributions from his office. Later that month, in Beijing, Mr. Gore clinked Champagne glasses with Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister who ordered the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.

  Mr. Gore was known within the administration as at least the second most influential adviser to the president, after Hillary Rodham Clinton. He was often the quickest to push an aggressive approach, whether on foreign policy or on budgets or on trade.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore was still vice president, not prime minister, and his advice was not always taken. Early in the administration, Mr. Gore sought a significant assignment, like carrying out the campaign promise to end welfare ''as we know it.'' But he wound up with the less-than-electrifying ''reinventing government'' initiative.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's early pleas on the Balkans likewise went unheeded. In numerous internal discussions in early 1993, Mr. Gore pressed for the use of American air power to slow the ethnic slaughter in Bosnia, White House aides said. Mr. Gore was essentially silenced until 1995 when he again became a passionate advocate for allied intervention.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But what mystifies these people is that while Mr. Gore was often bold and forceful in the councils of government, he has stumbled as a candidate and has failed to capitalize on his significant record of accomplishment to make the case for his election.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000

 <textdata>
  ''What's amazing about him is he's a much less courageous campaigner than I would have thought and much more courageous in governance than I thought he would be,'' said a senior White House official who has observed Mr. Gore closely for the last eight years. ''He was really gutsy as a government official, but that just doesn't translate to the campaign. Gore just wants to get elected, then he thinks he'll be free to do the right thing.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Even before Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore were inaugurated in January 1993, the vice president had negotiated an unprecedented role for a No. 2.  He was not to be deputy president, but he would have real authority over a number of areas where he claimed expertise: the environment, science and technology and streamlining government.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore exercised that power early on by placing loyalists in critical posts throughout the government. Leon Fuerth, his longtime foreign policy adviser, was included in every important meeting of the National Security Council. Carol M. Browner, a former Senate aide, was named administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Frank W. Hunger, Mr. Gore's brother-in-law, went to the Justice Department as head of the civil division. Kathleen McGinty, another former Senate aide, was put in charge of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Reed Hundt, a friend from Mr. Gore's prep-school days at St. Albans, was named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000

  The task involved combing the entire federal bureaucracy for waste, duplication and uneconomic purchasing practices. It was a job for an accountant, not a would-be president, but Mr. Gore took to it like a man killing rats with a broomstick.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000

 <textdata>
  In his third debate with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Gore claimed the reinvention program had reduced government civilian employment by 300,000 workers, to the lowest level since John F. Kennedy was president. In fact, the number of total jobs cut is considerably higher -- almost 400,000 -- but two-thirds of them are military workers whose jobs were eliminated by the military drawdown brought by the end of the cold war.

  ''Gore is clearly wrong to argue that reinventing government caused the decline in civil service employment that did occur,'' said Paul C. Light, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. ''He would have been perfectly right to say the Clinton administration 'oversaw,' 'participated in,' or 'implemented' the cuts, but reinventing government did not cause the decline in total jobs. It was the end of the cold war, pure and simple.''

  Mr. Gore was the first vice president to serve as a full member of the National Security Council and was given broad sway over a large part of United States policy toward Russia. In April 1994, Mr. Clinton asked Mr. Gore to meet regularly with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister, to address aspects of United States-Russian relations that came under Mr. Gore's areas of expertise but did not rise to the presidential level. The two men took up disarmament, space cooperation, legal issues and the environment, among other issues.

  The first year of the administration was memorable for its early chaos and the budget package that passed only with Mr. Gore casting the tie-breaking 51st vote in the Senate. The White House was riven into competing camps: those who wanted to attack the growing federal budget deficits and those who believed Mr. Clinton had to make good on his campaign promises to ''invest'' billions of new dollars in education, training and other social programs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was firmly in the camp of the deficit hawks. And he saw an additional benefit to budget stringency: he could test his environmental theories in a real-life laboratory.
 </textdata>

  The vice president pushed hard to have an energy tax included in the administration's first budget package, and Mr. Clinton finally acceded, over the objections of many political advisers who said that the painful plan was a sure loser on Capitol Hill. They were right. Congress rebelled at the proposal and the president quickly abandoned it, leaving Mr. Gore embarrassed and politically scarred.

  ''Gore felt that if we were going to impose pain on the American people, he wanted it to be environmentally conscious,'' said a member of the administration's economic team. ''He believed that since we were raising so much from the top one or two percent, the plan's credibility depended on a little tough medicine that affected everybody.''
 </textdata>

  In this battle, as in later fights, Mr. Gore argued that the public would reward boldness, that the administration would win points for taking on its own party in Congress and entrenched interests in private industry.

  At a pivotal White House meeting in mid-July, Mr. Gore recalled a haunting newspaper photograph of a young woman from Srebrenica who had apparently hanged herself after Serbs overran the area. He said his daughter Karenna, then 21, had seen the picture and asked him why the United States was not doing more to end the conflict. He pleaded for more forceful action to punish the Serbs, according to officials who were present.

 <textdata>
  ''On Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo and the Middle East, he was always the most forceful advocate in the room for a strong policy,'' said Mr. Holbrooke, who is often mentioned as a likely candidate for secretary of state in a Gore administration. ''He wasn't always an interventionist; he's a very careful man. But he had a deep conviction on the importance of American leadership based on moral values and American national interests.''

  The president and the vice president had a standing lunch date every week for the first years of the administration, broken only when one was out of town. Aides said that Mr. Gore used those sessions, among other things, as a tutorial for the president on environmental issues -- global warming, logging in the Pacific Northwest, oil drilling in Alaska, the Clean Air Act, land preservation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore devoted whole sessions with the president to obscure matters, like the evaporation of the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The vice president contended that these issues were, like Bosnia and other foreign policy challenges, urgent matters not only of national interest but of moral obligation to future generations. It is a point that Mr. Gore made in his book, ''Earth in the Balance'' as well as in numerous public addresses.

  Blocked by Congress, the administration failed to impose the higher mileage standards that Mr. Gore sought for automobiles. In another defeat, Mr. Clinton ignored Mr. Gore's advice and signed a spending bill that permitted the clear-cutting of certain Western forests. Three months after Mr. Clinton signed the bill, Mr. Gore told a group of environmentalists that the measure was the ''biggest mistake of the first term.''
 </textdata>

  The Senate was already on record, 95-0, as opposing any agreement that held advanced nations to higher standards than developing ones. The United States delegation to the talks was making no progress, despite prodding from Mr. Gore by telephone. Mr. Gore's aides unanimously urged him to keep his distance from what was shaping up as a failure and a humiliating blow to his prestige. He overrode their advice and flew to Japan, where he told developing nations he understood their concerns and instructed American negotiators to reach a deal at all costs.
 </textdata>

  And global warming remains a contentious political issue. Governor Bush and his surrogates use Mr. Gore's position as a weapon against him in states dependent on automobile manufacturing and coal production; Mr. Gore issues warnings that Mr. Bush's industry-friendly policies could devastate the earth's fragile ecology.

  More than any previous vice president, Mr. Gore was granted ministerial power by President Clinton. In April 1993, Mr. Clinton deputized him to oversee much of American policy on Russia and the former Soviet Union. The mechanism was a panel that became known as the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The relationship between Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin remains a subject of much debate today. Republicans have harshly criticized the vice president about a confidential 1995 agreement between Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin that allowed Russia to export a large cache of conventional weapons to Iran. The deal appeared to undercut a law, co-sponsored by Mr. Gore when he was a senator, that required economic sanctions against countries that transfer arms to countries that sponsor terrorism, including Iran.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The early years of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission yielded undeniable benefits, along with controversy. The two men sped the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, discussed the privatization of much of Russian state industry, supervised the conversion of some Russian military enterprises to civilian work and took early steps toward establishment of free markets and the rule of law. Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin furthered cooperation between the United States and Russia in space; their relationship helped avert a trade war in 1996 over frozen chicken parts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000

 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore's close ties to Mr. Chernomyrdin came into play again a year later when the United States was seeking an end to the latest Balkan conflict. Mr. Chernomyrdin was named Moscow's special envoy to Belgrade, with the task of trying to persuade Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his troops from Kosovo. Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin met late into the night at Mr. Gore's residence, helping to fashion a diplomatic strategy, ultimately successful, to force Mr. Milosevic to back down.

  Throughout much of American history, the vice president has served chiefly as a reminder of presidential mortality. These eight years have proved another way of looking at the job. Mr. Clinton granted Mr. Gore broad power in areas of his expertise, and Mr. Gore applied it.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Gore demolished Ross Perot in a debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement and helped secure passage of the trade deal over the objections of many Democrats in Congress.

  The final week of any hard-fought campaign brings out the best and worst in candidates and their campaign strategists and advertising experts. The presidential contenders are in full cry and have gotten down to the basics of their pitches to the voters, with Vice President Al Gore portraying Gov. George W. Bush as lacking experience and Mr. Bush asserting that Mr. Gore lacks integrity. Much is being made of their negative tone and the ever tougher messages delivered by telephone. But our view is that while there have been some unfortunate excesses, there is also nothing inherently wrong with sharp exchanges and rhetorical attacks about character and stands on issues in a campaign. Indeed they are a vital part of the process and a standard feature of the last week of most campaigns.
 </textdata>

  But we hope that both sides in the presidential contest realize they are pushing the outside of the acceptability envelope. The attacks that have riled Republicans include a phone message for the Democrats, delivered by the actor Ed Asner, warning that Mr. Bush's Social Security scheme jeopardizes current benefits, which is certainly an exaggeration. Another Democratic telephone attack featuring a Texas woman who suggests that her husband's death resulted in part from Mr. Bush's failure to improve nursing homes was hyperbolic and in bad taste. The Gore campaign, meanwhile, is furious that the governor's team is running an ad featuring Ralph Nader's attacks on the vice president's environmental record, which looks to us like fair game. An independent pro-Bush group's ad, showing a girl plucking a daisy like the girl in a notorious 1964 ad against Barry Goldwater, and asserting that the Clinton administration had given away nuclear secrets, is an unjustified smear and the Bush campaign was right to ask for its withdrawal.

  The Democrats are further buoyed by the presence of Al Gore on the top of the party's ticket.

  The reassessment coincides with intense media scrutiny of Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign and his support for capital punishment in Texas, which leads the nation in executions. Mr. Bush has remained firm in his position that the system in his state is administered fairly; he has said that no moratorium is needed there and that he would oppose a moratorium on federal executions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, also favors capital punishment. Mr. Gore has chosen not to make a campaign issue of Texas' executing more prisoners than any other state, has voiced no support for moratoriums in states other than Illinois and has said he does not think a federal moratorium  is needed ''at this time.''

  INVOKING A SAINT -- The man for all seasons found his name being invoked this election season as Dick Cheney noted yesterday that Pope John Paul II was about to proclaim St. Thomas More the patron saint of statesmen and politicians. And, the way Mr. Cheney told it at a Catholic high school in Rochester, Minn., the churchman who stood up to Henry VIII sounded just a little bit like Gov. George W. Bush. ''When the announcement was made at the Vatican last week, one politician present praised More as a figure who unites rather than divides, a man with great universal appeal,'' said Mr. Cheney, whose running mate likes to say that he is a uniter, not a divider. ''Today our world needs more Thomas Mores. Governor Bush and I can never live up to his standards, but we can try, and that is what we will do if we are elected next Tuesday.''

  In a case of grass roots meets back room, a handful of Web sites have sprung up in last few weeks promoting the notion that supporters of Vice President Al Gore and Ralph Nader barter votes and even giving them a forum to do so.

 <textdata>
  The idea is that backers of Mr. Nader, the Green Party presidential nominee, in states where Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are running neck and neck would cast their vote for Mr. Gore, and help out the man they see as a better choice. In exchange, a voter in a sure Gore state would vote for Mr. Nader and help the Greens reach the 5 percent threshold the party needs to qualify for federal financing.

  Gore campaign officials said the Democratic strategy has been to take aim at Nader supporters by emphasizing what is dear to them. ''We believe that many Nader voters are concerned about freedom of choice, the environment, and don't want to see those issues put at risk by a Bush presidency,'' said a Gore spokesman, Doug Hattaway.
 </textdata>

  Battleground states where votes for Mr. Nader could undermine Mr. Gore are Oregon, Wisconsin and Minnesota, as well as Washington and Michigan to a lesser extent, Gore campaign officials said.

  ''Before the debates, I really expected Gore to shine, and he hasn't,'' Mr. Porter said. ''We just got nervous about the situation, and I think that's what inspired us to actually do something.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. Porter acknowledges that the idea has a ''potential flaw.'' Traders remain anonymous, so there is no guarantee each side will follow through, or that Bush supporters might not try to manipulate the system. Participants are encouraged to contact each other to judge intent.

  ''I've been agonizing like a lot of progressive Democrats who have been excited by Nader's revitalization of progressive politics, but don't want to see Bush elected president,'' Prof. Raskin said. ''It occurred to me that there was a win-win scenario out there.''

  On Sunday, Mr. Gore planted multiple wet ones on Mrs. Gore at a rally in East Lansing, Mich., before they set off on a two-day bus tour of Michigan and Wisconsin. He did it again during a Fox News interview taped that evening.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And later that night, he leaned in for another kiss in Muskegon, Mich., in front of 15,000 people who roared their approval. But after the first one, Mrs. Gore playfully pushed her amorous husband away.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Like every spouse ever caught out, Mr. Gore tried to explain himself. Pointing into the audience, he said to his wife: ''Look at that sign now. It says, 'Let us see the kiss.' Are you embarrassed? Once is enough?''
 </textdata>

  On Sunday, at least, Mr. Gore might have used the excuse of looking for a little warmth on a cold night, but he blew it, stripping off his suit coat and saying, ''I know it's chilly out here, but I'm feeling hot.''

  In a much-dissected makeover early this year, Mr. Gore adopted a just-folks set of casual clothes, mostly in earth tones, in one of many bids to loosen up. But in the last few weeks, in the campaign's final sprint, the vice president has ditched the taupes and khakis, even in settings that invite informality, in favor of the dark suits, white shirts and ties that used to be his public uniform.
 </textdata>

  With his wardrobe switch, Mr. Gore today echoed (no doubt unintentionally) another era and another politician. Before delivering a speech this morning on the sandy shore of Lake Michigan in Muskegon, the vice president strode across the beach in a suit, along with Mrs. Gore. It was reminiscent of a photo opportunity staged for Richard M. Nixon, in which he strolled down a beach wearing a suit -- an image that crystallized Nixon's reputation for being perpetually ill at ease.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore should have been well aware of the Nixon parallel. Last month, on a beach in Florida, the vice president joked with two reporters and an aide about Nixon's beach walk. That day, he wore shorts and a polo shirt, and went barefoot.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Chris Lehane, the campaign press secretary, said the change was nothing more than a bow to the cooler weather. When asked if Mr. Gore might be trying to look more presidential for the stretch run, Mr. Lehane said, ''I think you're looking too deeply into this.''

  Mr. Gore drew 30,000 people last week to a rally in Madison, Wis. -- an extraordinary figure, by contemporary standards, for a small city -- more than 15,000 in Muskegon, and 11,000 tonight in Waukesha, Wis., according to the police in those cities. Last Thursday, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running mate, spoke to more than 5,000 people at a rally in Santa Fe, N.M. Gov. George W. Bush has also drawn larger audiences lately.

  Even as recently as the last hotly contested race, in 1992, Bill Clinton and Mr. Gore were speaking to large groups in midsummer, just after the Democratic convention. Whether the later appearance of big turnouts this year reflects the continuation of a long trend, or simply a lack of interest in this year's contest, is open to question.

  Senator Russell D. Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who -- with Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican -- has championed campaign-finance reform, gave Mr. Gore his endorsement today. And Mr. Gore spoke at length at his rallies about the importance of diminishing the effect of money in politics -- a major plank in the platform of Mr.  Nader, the longtime consumer advocate whose appeal to voters in states like Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Washington and Oregon could tip the election to Mr. Gore's rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.

  In an interview tonight, Mr. Gore said he had not tailored his message to win over Nader supporters. He also said he had ''not talked to a single person'' about trying to persuade Mr. Nader to get out of the race.

  On Tuesday, Mr. Gore is to fly from Milwaukee to Portland, Ore., where he hopes a last-minute rally can move that state his way.

 <textdata>
  Carter Eskew, a top Gore strategist, said that Mr. Gore might break through to Nader voters with two particular themes -- discussion of campaign finance and a reminder that abortion rights are at stake in this election. Mr. Gore focused heavily on both.

  On the subject of revamping campaign finance, Mr. Gore said that the drug companies and insurance industry were backing Mr. Bush to protect their profits.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  ''It is morally wrong for the decisions about your health to be made on the basis of what is going to improve the bottom line for an H.M.O. rather than on the basis of what's best for your health,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The H.M.O.'s and the big insurance companies have been able to use their wealth and their political influence and power to convince a majority in the Congress to block a patient's bill of rights,'' he declared. ''They want to stay in control of the medical decisions. And they're supporting Governor Bush because they want him in control of the medical quality. I want to fight for you.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. Gore was not all earnestness today. He doffed his jacket at the Green Bay rally, telling the crowd,  ''It's chilly, but I'm hot, and I'm telling you, this election is hot!''

  Off and on throughout the day, more than two dozen vehicles in the Gore bus caravan snaked southward through Wisconsin. After drawing a crowd of 30,000 people last week in Madison, Mr. Gore is gaining a slight edge over Mr. Bush, the polls show. Still, Mr. Nader continues to draw a fraction of the vote, which could prove crucial to Mr. Gore in the final balloting.

  The same is true in Michigan, where Mr. Gore began his day where it had ended the night before, in Muskegon. This morning, he stood on the shore of Lake Michigan in a blue suit and read a slightly retooled stump speech to about 200 people who were sitting on chairs planted in the sand, bundled up against the morning chill.

  The serene setting and low-key tone of the event softened an edge to the words that Mr. Gore summoned against Mr. Bush. He said that Mr. Bush would ''play games'' with Social Security and leave families ''worse off than they are today.''

  Saying that his own smaller tax cut would allow the nation to pay down the debt, Mr. Gore said that Governor Bush's larger tax cut would ''repeat the past, like a broken record, letting the wealthiest Americans gorge themselves on tax cuts they don't really need.'' Americans ''deserve a president who champions all of the people and doesn't just cave in to the few,'' Mr. Gore said. And they ''deserve better than rubber checks to pay for runaway spending and a rubber stamp for the powerful interests.''

  They want Governor Bush to be in control of the policy because they support him and he supports them.

  Gore Campaign Challenges Bush's Ability to Be Leader  Vice President Al Gore's wife and his running mate -- but not Mr. Gore himself -- portrayed Gov. George W. Bush as too inexperienced to be president, an argument the Gore campaign hopes will help derail the Bush candidacy. Mr. Gore cast the presidential election as a chance for people to reject the influence of special interests, saying at a rally in Michigan, ''This country belongs to you, and I want to give it back to you.''

  ''You have the power,'' Mr. Gore said at an afternoon rally in East Lansing.

  By contrast, Mr. Bush was off the campaign trail today. He spoke by satellite from his home in Austin, Tex., to a group of Hispanic Republicans in California. His aides, meanwhile, outlined what they called the largest ever Republican grass-roots effort to get out the vote. [Page A15.]

  ''You don't have to fall in love with Al Gore -- I did that,'' Mrs. Gore said. ''What you need to do is figure out who you're going to vote for for president, and I know that you are going to weigh experience. That's important.''

  ''I don't think Governor Bush is ready -- based on his experience, his record, his proposals in this campaign -- to be the kind of president that the American people need at this point in our history,'' Mr. Lieberman said on the ABC News program ''This Week.''

  Describing Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan, he warned a church congregation that if Americans ''put our trust in that disproven, discredited, failed theory that says give it to those at the very top and ultimately it will work its way down, we tried that. Been there, done that, still paying the bill.''

  As his campaign caravan cut through Michigan today, Mr. Gore pleaded for votes at every stop, portraying Mr. Bush as a captive of special interests like drug companies, the oil industry and the managed-care industry, and telling voters that Election Day was their chance to strike back.

  ''This country belongs to you, and I want to give it back to you,'' Mr. Gore shouted at the rally in Muskegon on the first day of a two-day bus caravan in Michigan and Wisconsin.  ''And if you elect me on Nov. 7, I will give it back to you.''
 </textdata>

  Casting his 24 years in political office as those of a crusader against the ''special interests,'' Mr. Gore added, ''I know where the rats in the barn are, and you know what, the rats in the barn know that I know, and that's why they're coming out trying to stop us.''

  ''Paul wrote twice, to the Galatians and Second Thessalonians, 'Do not grow weary in well doing.' We have done well in the last eight years,'' Mr. Gore said from the pulpit at the Hartford Memorial Baptist Church. Continuing to quote, he said: ''But in due season we shall reap if we faint not.''

  He found a new way to illustrate Mr. Bush's tax cut: ''My opponent proposes to spend more money on tax benefits to the wealthiest 90,000 multimillionaires than all his proposals to spend money on 90,000 public schools all across the United States of America.''

  In the spring, Mr. Gore contended  that Mr. Bush lacked the experience to be president, but he has not made that argument for months, presumably for fear of being seen as breaking his vow not to personally attack the governor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has even gone to some lengths to tell reporters that he is not making that argument. In a late-night flight on Saturday from Minneapolis to Romulus, Mich., Mr. Gore was asked about an editorial in The New York Times, which in endorsing Mr. Gore said that Mr. Bush was too inexperienced for the job.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Nonetheless, Tad Devine, a top Gore strategist, said the campaign intended to capitalize on the ''tremendous sense of unease'' that voters feel about Mr. Bush's lack of experience.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''In many ways, Governor Bush is not up to the job of being president,'' Mr. Devine said, adding that while Mr. Gore's positions on issues would be the central argument for the vice president's election, the campaign would make the lack of experience the central issue against Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Devine also said that Mr. Gore would be linking Mr. Bush more directly with Congressional Republicans, an argument Mr. Gore began to make on Saturday in an address in Pennsylvania when he said a health care bill provided millions for health maintenance organizations but did not include patient protections.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He will be tied in with the Republicans in Congress,'' Mr. Devine said. ''This is why he's having difficulty in Florida, after the Republican takeover, and it's why Gore is ahead there -- there's a perception that the Republicans in Washington have done some very bad things for programs that people rely on. This could be very damaging to Bush.''

  Vice President Al Gore has long been an advocate of dealing aggressively with global warming, which was the focus of his book, ''Earth in the Balance.'' He recently described global warming as a ''moral issue.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has done some campaigning on the issue and has proposed creation of an environmental trust fund, which, among other things, would provide incentives for the development of new technologies to limit emissions of greenhouse gases.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000

 <textdata>
  Gov. George W. Bush has been somewhat equivocal when it comes to global warming. He has acknowledged that it is a problem. But in his second debate with Mr. Gore, the governor said, ''I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet and I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush opposes the Kyoto Protocol, which he has said is ''unfair to the United States.''

  It is also important to Gov. George W. Bush. From the day he began running for president, Mr. Bush has made education his signature issue, boasting of rising test scores during his tenure and portraying the Texas system as his blueprint for America.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But even as Mr. Bush has pointed to the scores, a growing number of teachers, parents and academics are questioning whether Texas's system is truly producing better students. The political rhetoric of the so-called Texas miracle in education seems high blown to many parents and teachers. Nor do they believe the other extreme, that the system is fundamentally failing. But many worry that the test has become so consuming that more meaningful instruction is often eclipsed in the rush for high scores.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The test covers math, reading and writing, and is given in the 3rd through 8th grades and in 10th grade as a requirement of graduation. The number of students in all grades passing all sections of the test has risen to 80 percent this year, from 58 percent in 1995, when Mr. Bush took office. The biggest gains have been among black students, where the rate has gone to 67 percent from 31 percent, and Hispanics, to 72 percent from 39 percent.

  Although the Bush campaign strongly disputed the RAND study, pointing to an earlier, more favorable RAND report, some parents, like Carol Holst, were not surprised. Mrs. Holst's son is a fifth grader in a suburban Houston school where she said teachers spent six weeks ignoring subjects not on the test, like science and social studies, while preparing students for the TAAS.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The shortage of such courses comes as Texas is struggling to better prepare students for college. Even as TAAS scores have gone up, the scores of Texas students on college entrance exams have been stagnant. The Bush campaign says those scores have remained flat because more students are taking the tests, considered a good sign, though the percentage of the overall enrollment taking the test has actually not changed.

  Many legislators credit Mr. Bush for emphasizing education and helping to strengthen the system.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000

 <textdata>
  The issue of dropouts cuts directly to Mr. Bush's promise that the system ''leaves no child behind.'' State statistics show the dropout rate is nearly 15 percent, higher among blacks and Hispanics, while other studies question the state's counting system and put the rate above 30 percent. In September 1999, The El Paso Times published an investigation showing that more than 30,000 students labeled by the system as ''transfers'' were most likely dropouts. A study of big city schools by State Senator Gonzalo Barrientos, a Democrat, found that more incoming ninth graders dropped out than graduated on time.

  To some who run voter registration drives and encourage young people to vote, Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore have not done enough to make the issues relevant. ''There's no recognition of the issues young people care about, in any of these speeches,'' said John Dervin, the spokesman for Youth Vote 2000, a Washington-based coalition of organizations that promotes civic involvement by young people. ''It's almost like we aren't worth that extra couple of sentences. You throw out a $10,000 tax credit without saying, 'to keep you out of debt' or whatever.''

  Both campaigns point to MTV appearances and traditional networks of student support, but spokesmen for both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore said their candidates did not tailor their messages when speaking on college campuses. ''What we've seen from Governor Bush and the Bush campaign is a strong and consistent message aimed at all Americans,'' said Ray Sullivan, a Bush spokesman.
 </textdata>

  Some credit Mr. Gore with making a greater effort. Unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore agreed to participate in a 90-minute question and answer session on MTV. And at a rally in Madison, Wis., last week, he catered to the college town crowd with expressions like ''Hull-oh?''

  Except, perhaps, for a state bond referendum for higher education, there was no single issue driving students to the polls in North Carolina. For many, the decision-making process involved a painful weighing of many issues rather than a sudden epiphany.

  Enthusiasm for the candidates as people was virtually nonexistent, with many students poking fun at rhetoric such as Mr. Bush's ''affirmative access'' or Mr. Gore's claim of inventing the Internet. ''I think they're both crackheads,'' said Jenny Jones, 27, referring not to drug addicts but to people who appear less than rational.

Although she said she would vote, she was not convinced that the election's outcome would affect her. ''The one thing that did resonate with me is when Gore said he would give people $10,000,'' she said, referring to the candidate's proposal to make some higher education expenses tax-deductible. ''Because I know how expensive it is to be here.''

  George W. Bush, in contrast, argues that an overextended American military should gradually pull out of the Balkans -- a step that the Europeans view as abandonment.

  Yet Mr. Bush, asked in the second presidential debate to describe his philosophy for projecting American power, sounded startlingly like Mr. Gore. ''If we are an arrogant nation, they will resent us,'' he said. ''If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.''

  Drawing on the advice of Gen. Colin L. Powell, widely viewed as a potential secretary of state in a Bush administration, Mr. Bush is far more tentative about committing American troops and rules out their use for what he dismisses as nation building. ''There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often,'' he said in the final presidential debate. In the second debate he suggested a broader philosophical disagreement with Mr. Gore: ''I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say, 'This is the way it's got to be.' ''

  Any comparison of foreign policy between the two candidates is inherently unbalanced: Mr. Gore has a long record, in the Senate and as vice president, while during Mr. Bush's time as governor, his only real foreign focus has been Mexico, whose long border with Texas is a major matter of state and local politics.

  The Texas governor has traveled frequently to Mexico, and says that as president he would focus on Latin America far more intensively than the Clinton Administration. But beyond those trips Mr. Bush, now 54, has left America's shores only three times in his adult life. He spent five or six weeks in China in 1975, on a break from graduate school when his father was American envoy to Beijing. When his father was president, he led an American delegation to the Gambia for a celebration of the country's independence.

  Mr. Bush's aides say these meetings have left him at least as well prepared for the presidency as three past governors: Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. Nonetheless, Mr. Bush makes foreign policy by committee, and prefers to have his coterie of advisers answer all the questions.

  Mr. Gore's eagerness to place America's imprint on the world has clearly grown in his seven years in the vice presidency, which have featured dozens of trips abroad and many meetings with world leaders. White House advisers recall him making an impassioned plea to President Clinton in the summer of 1995 to threaten bombing Serbian forces after they overran a United Nations safe area in Bosnia, a moment that one aide said was now ''seared on the front of Al Gore's brain.'' The former United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, recalls bringing Mr. Gore to meetings about how to confront Japan on opening its economy ''so that I would sound like only the second-most vociferous guy in the room.''

  What Mr. Bush derides as nation building, Mr. Gore calls a natural evolution, decades later, of the Marshall Plan -- when American willpower and capital, and some American troops, helped rebuild Europe.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  That difference was accentuated this month when Mr. Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said the Republican contender would, if elected, gradually pull the remaining American troops out of the Balkans, after consulting with NATO allies. That prompted Mr. Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to shoot back that Mr. Bush would squander a nascent American victory in rebuilding the former Yugoslavia, where there are now some 11,400 troops, less than 20 percent of the total peacekeeping presence in Bosnia and Kosovo.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Lurking just beneath the surface of that dispute are questions that both candidates have left unanswered. Mr. Bush has never defined what kind of mission is in the ''vital national interest.'' Mr. Gore has never said how long he would keep troops in place to build a democratic state. Mr. Bush, in short, won't say when he'll wade into a crisis, and Mr. Gore won't say when he'll get out.
 </textdata>

  These positions reflect, in many ways, the advisers who surround the two men. Mr. Gore depends heavily on Leon Fuerth, his national security aide for two decades, who urged him to break with the Democrats and vote for going to war with Iraq in 1991. Richard Holbrooke, the United Nations ambassador, supported Mr. Gore's ill-fated run for the presidency in 1988, a political risk one aide says ''the vice president has not forgotten.'' He is often mentioned as candidate for secretary of state. And Mr. Gore has grown closer to Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, the architect of the Clinton administration's biggest financial interventions, from the Mexican bailout to the Asian crisis.

  Mr. Bush relies heavily on Ms. Rice and a large cast of other graduates of his father's administration. Their influence is evident: Long before Mr. Bush ever criticized the International Monetary Fund, another close adviser, former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, said it should be shut down.

  Mr. Bush has made it clear that he will go ahead with a missile defense shield no matter what America's allies think -- and despite the harm it might inflict on America's fundamental relationships with Russia and China. Mr. Gore has repeatedly expressed a desire to incorporate environmental and labor rules in every future trade accord -- even though poorer nations view that as an unvarnished effort to assure that developing nations remain less competitive with American manufacturers.

  Gore and Globalization

  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Not surprisingly, Mr. Gore tries to portray himself as the candidate best prepared to delve into the newest and most complex territory of foreign affairs, the challenges of economic globalization. The vice president's aides whisper that Mr. Bush's advisers are lost in the thicket of 1980's era problems, and are unprepared for a world in which global capital flows can cause as much havoc as global arms sales.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a speech last spring in Boston, Mr. Gore charged that his rival was ''stuck in a cold war mindset,'' that ''continues to view Russia and China primarily as present or future enemies.'' At one point he said that ''Governor Bush's foreign policy is noticeably blank.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has never repeated that charge, but his aides do what they can to sow doubts about Mr. Bush's competence as a potential world leader and a recent New York Times poll indicated that roughly half of American voters have their doubts on that score.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's campaign officials say that in the second presidential debate their candidate established himself as respectably conversant in the major international issues of the day. Mr. Bush himself was comfortable enough to joke shortly afterward about his trouble wrapping his tongue around the names of world leaders. ''I was especially pleased that Mr. Milosevic has stepped down,'' he said after the Yugoslav leader bowed to a street revolt. ''It's one less polysyllabic name for me to remember.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore frequently passes up opportunities to describe a sweeping vision of how he would position the United States in the world. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, has mastered that patter, rarely missing a chance to draw the link between economic integration and the spread of capitalism and democracy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore knows Asia well. He talks about his priorities there more crisply than many of his foreign policy advisers do. (Sometimes, in fact, he is too crisp: When he backed anti-government protesters in Malaysia two years ago, using their rallying cry of ''reformasi,'' in a speech, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad deftly used the moment to whip up a nationalist backlash against America that squashed the reform movement.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But as one of his informal advisers says, ''all the imagery is bad for him'' in Asia. Raising broad visions of how to deal with China, for example, invites the Bush campaign to play up the photos of Mr. Gore bowing at the Buddhist temple in California that became the subject of lengthy campaign finance investigation. (The temple was linked to Taiwan, not China, but such subtleties are lost in campaigns.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So Mr. Gore's campaign has indicated that he would continue in the Clinton mode of using economic ties to encourage China to greater openness, democracy and capitalism. But as China's leaders have stepped up the arrest of political and religious dissidents in the last year, Mr. Bush has homed in on the Clinton administration's oratory about a ''strategic relationship'' with Beijing. (Mr. Gore does not use that term.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''China is a competitor, not a strategic partner,'' Mr. Bush often says. And he has indicated that he would sharply depart from the Clinton script in two ways: by pursuing the national missile defense, which China vigorously opposes and would counter with more and better intercontinental missiles, and perhaps by announcing a break with longstanding policy and pledging that the United States would come to Taiwan's aid if it was attacked by China.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000

 <textdata>
  There has been more talk about Russia, where Mr. Gore played a leading role, though a commission he co-chaired with former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. Mr. Gore knew from the outset that an active role in guiding Russia toward a new role in the world would distinguish him from any potential rival for the presidency. And the effort had some early successes, including an agreement to return to Russia the nuclear weapons that had been stationed in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. But American hopes of guiding economic reforms went off-track, and recent disclosures indicate that Mr. Gore failed to get Russia to halt arms sales to Iran by this year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush argues that the administration was naive, ''focusing our aid and attention on a corrupt and favored elite'' that sometimes failed to fulfill promises made to Mr. Gore. ''When Bill Clinton compared Boris Yeltsin in Chechnya to Abraham Lincoln, what signal did that send to states around Russia's periphery?'' asks Ms. Rice, a Russia expert. ''When the Russians didn't follow the favorable and attractive script we wrote for them, we continued to pretend they were carrying out their part of the bargain. They lost respect for us as a result.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has offered only generalities about how he would handle Russia differently, and has never said how he would persuade Moscow to accept the missile defense system that could require quitting the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. (Ms. Rice says that Mr. Bush would review ''the size of the American arsenal,'' and perhaps reduce it).
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the Middle East, Mr. Bush has gone to some lengths not to criticize Mr. Clinton's handling of a volatile and deteriorating situation -- at least not directly. And Mr. Gore has been almost completely uninvolved in managing the failed Camp David talks and diplomacy that followed -- until he flew back to Washington 10 days ago to sit in on the meetings planning Mr. Clinton's summit meeting with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Mr. Barak.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indirectly, though, Mr. Bush has thrown a few jabs. ''You can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable,'' he said in a not-so-subtle suggestion that Mr. Clinton rushed into Camp David in hopes of a comprehensive agreement before he left office.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush stumbled when asked in the first debate how he would handle a stock market crisis -- and then announced that he would summon his top advisers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore pointed to Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, in the audience, a man regarded in Washington and on Wall Street as a cool manager of such crises. He seemed to suggest that he would call his old friend -- now a top executive at Citigroup -- and then he changed the subject. ''He clearly wasn't prepared for that one,'' one of his close economic advisers said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his interview, Mr. Gore was similarly vague about his standards for economic intervention. ''I'm not sure there is a handy cookie cutter on that one,'' he said. ''I think there are so many variables that you have to know it when you see it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Rice said in an interview that Mr. Bush's first criteria for bailing out a foreign nation would be ''whether the countries we are helping have the political will to make economic reforms.'' Clearly Russia in 1998 -- a bailout Mr. Gore helped coordinate -- did not fit her test. Other Bush aides tick off economic criteria closely parallel to that of Mr. Summers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is more leery of the role of the International Monetary Fund. ''I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way,'' he said in the second presidential debate. He charged that the fund -- which the United States effectively controls as its largest shareholder -- often sends the message to international bankers that ''if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He also charged that much of the $4.8 billion lent to Russia in 1998 ended up ''in the pockets'' of Mr. Chernomyrdin. Mr. Chernomyrdin denied it, threatening to sue Mr. Bush for defamation. The I.M.F. says independent auditors have found no evidence that the money was diverted, and the Bush campaign has cited no evidence to back up the charge.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Rice insisted that Mr. Bush's broader point was correct. ''Once the Russians were flaunting it, cooking the books, and once their privatization effort went awry, we kept pumping I.M.F. money in,'' she said. ''That weakened the I.M.F., and it allowed the Russians to have a kind of drug on which they became dependent. It was a mistake. A big one.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000

  Economic sanctions create a sticky problem for both candidates. Mr. Gore defends the slow lifting of sanctions against North Korea, saying, ''Incredibly enough, we have seen a positive response to initiatives there,'' but refuses to consider trying the same approach on Cuba. ''I'm a hard-liner on Castro,'' he said, ticking off the Cuban leader's list of offenses, and ignoring a similarly long list for North Korea.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Cuba, of course, is a highly emotional issue in Florida, whose 25 electoral votes are hotly contested. So Mr. Bush has taken a similarly tough line. But he has also distanced himself from the views of his running mate, Dick Cheney. In 1998, while running Halliburton, the oil services company,  Mr. Cheney said unilateral sanctions almost always fail and hurt the competitiveness of American businesses. He called for lifting sanctions on Iran, saying the United States could no longer rely on them ''as a club that we can use to punish those who disagree with policies or goals or objectives of the United States.'' Mr. Bush has said pointedly that he is not ready to lift sanctions on Iran.

  Mr. Gore is accustomed to weaving between his free-trading boss and the labor unions that make up his core support. Those unions have opposed every major free trade initiative by the administration, from the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 to the China trade bill that passed last month, and some threatened to bolt from Mr. Gore. In the end, they backed down.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This year, Mr. Gore backed the China trade legislation, just as he backed the North American trade pact in 1993. It did not include standards for protecting workers or preserving the environment that he said in his interview he would, if elected, try to get included in all trade negotiations. A free trade agreement with Jordan, signed by Mr. Clinton last week, is the first to include all of those standards in the core of the accord.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush insists that he would aggressively press new accords -- without labor and environmental provisions -- and expand the North American pact to include much of the rest of Latin America.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In short, he sounds like a true free-trader. Yet in coal country, Mr. Bush has also bent over backward to draw in union workers who have become disaffected with Mr. Gore. Earlier this month he visited a coal-rich area of West Virginia, and was introduced by a laid-off miner who is president of a United Mine Workers local. ''This is an administration that fears coal,'' he said. ''They see it as a threat. I see it as an opportunity to make us less dependent on big, foreign oil.''

  Clearly trying to cast Mr. Bush's bid for the presidency as an unstoppable force, they said that about 62 million phone calls and 110 million pieces of mail would reach voters by Nov. 7, the culmination of efforts by the Bush campaign and state Republican parties that began about two weeks ago.

  ''We are launching the largest-ever Republican grass-roots effort,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, in a conference call with reporters today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Fleischer and other Bush aides also said high-profile surrogates including former President George Bush, Barbara Bush, Bob Dole and Elizabeth Dole would hit the campaign trail in full stride this week.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Fleischer emphasized that the Texas governor's itinerary over the first three days of a final, eight-day campaign swing would bring him to several states that were initially expected to be more favorable to Mr. Gore than they turned out to be.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Fleischer's obvious intentions were to project an aura of strength around the Bush campaign and to give Mr. Bush the luster of an inevitable winner, images that could sway some undecided voters in the end.

  Between Monday and Wednesday, Mr. Bush's schedule includes stops in California, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota and Iowa.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And while California in particular remains a long-shot for Mr. Bush, his campaign continues to lavish attention on the nation's most populous state, drawing attention to polls there that are tighter than most political analysts had predicted and making a statement of sorts about the campaign's confidence.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, Mr. Bush's only public event today was a satellite address to a gathering of California Latinos for Bush in Anaheim Hills. In those remarks, he seized on new language and evidence to press his charge that Mr. Gore's proposed programs would make the federal government too large.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''My opponent would add between 20 and 30,000 additional federal employees,'' Mr. Bush said, using a figure that the Gore campaign has disputed. In fact, Mr. Gore last week pledged a freeze on the hiring of new federal employees if he is elected president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush said: ''The effort's already begun. The I.R.S. recently announced it's hiring more than 2,000 new employees.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You have to wonder if the administration might be on a hiring spree so they can announce a freeze next year,'' Mr. Bush added.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, dismissed that notion, along with any suggestion that Mr. Gore was not committed to a lean federal government.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's father used to talk about the ''Big Mo,'' meaning momentum, and that was clearly what the Bush campaign, encouraged by Mr. Bush's slight lead in several national polls, was trying to signal today. And if they managed to rattle their opponent in the process, all the better.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As part of that endeavor, Mr. Bush's aides accused Democrats and the Gore campaign of adopting a divisive, negative tone that bespoke desperation. Mr. Fleischer said that Mr. Gore had ''brought politics to an unprecedented low,'' but that the Bush campaign would end their campaign on a positive, inspirational note.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's theme for his last eight days on the campaign trail, starting on Monday, will be ''bringing America together,'' and he will attempt to make the case, as he goes day by day through issue by issue, that he can unite Republicans and Democrats to solve tough problems.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Part of his argument, aides said, would be that he uses hope to appeal to people while Mr. Gore uses fear.

  Tad Devine, a top strategist with the Gore campaign, said that despite all the Bush campaign's talk about California being competitive, the Gore campaign was on solid ground there.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said that the principal reason for a visit that Mr. Gore plans to the state this week is to tape the ''Tonight'' show.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He went on to note that the Bush campaign has its own troubles in states that it was expected to dominate, citing recent polls in Florida that show Mr. Gore with an edge and signs that Mr. Bush's strong standing in Ohio has softened.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides, asserting that they had the campaign well in hand, went into extraordinary detail about some Republicans' activities, noting that Republicans will have planted about 1.2 million yard signs and distributed about 1.5 million bumper stickers by Election Day.

  A GENERAL ENLISTS -- In a final-week blitz of television advertising, automated telephone calls and mass mailings, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has enlisted the help of General Norman H. Schwarzkopf, his father's top field commander in the Persian Gulf war.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000

 <textdata>
  The general, now retired, made some appearances with Governor Bush earlier in the presidential campaign.

  10-30-2000

 <textdata>
  Several of these Democrats, including many of Mr. Gore's most enthusiastic supporters, offered a nearly unanimous verdict: the vice president has not benefited politically from the flourishing economy. And the best way for him to overtake Gov. George W. Bush, they said, is to convince voters that he has the record, and the skill, to keep the economy strong.

  ''He has to talk about the success of the last eight years,'' Mr. Breaux said, ''and say that Bush has not given the country enough reason for a change. He should have been emphasizing more the economic successes of the administration. That would have not allowed the Bush people to paint him as a big-government candidate.''

  Scoffing at polls showing that the economy ranked below issues like education and health care among many voters, Gov. Gray Davis of California said: ''All the more reason to remind them of their great and relatively recent good fortune. Most voters remember things were not too good when President Bush left office.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a poll released today by ABC News, as well as in other recent surveys, voters said that Mr. Gore was no more likely to protect the economy than Mr. Bush. Mr. Gore has not entirely neglected the administration's success with the economy in his speeches and has talked about it increasingly in recent weeks. But he has not made it the central theme of his campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  As the campaign entered its final week, with most polls showing that Mr. Bush holds a slight lead nationwide, the friendly counsel of these Democrats took on a sense of anxiety. While several Democrats said they were still optimistic that Mr. Gore would prevail, they expressed fear that Mr. Gore, who was moving ahead in the polls only a month ago, had been outsmarted by Mr. Bush and had let his advantage slip away.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Today, Mr. Gore, who is growing more intense in his oratory, implored congregants at a black church in Detroit to support him on Election Day. ''You have the ability to make the difference,'' Gore said at Hartford Memorial Baptist Church.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Shedding their usual spin, some of the Democrats interviewed in recent days uttered something that is obvious but that is not often heard from respected party officials: that a Bush victory is possible.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, a former Democratic national chairman, said Mr. Gore has been focusing on the economy but that ''it hasn't been resonating effectively.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Dodd explained: ''One of the difficulties is to talk about it and not talk about the president at the same time. It makes it an awkward conversation. Al Gore knows if we're talking about a third Clinton term, that would be a great liability. It makes your discussion about this somewhat stilted.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  In the interviews, prominent Democrats said Mr. Gore had not sought their advice. But they said they had voiced concerns to his advisers that he had not sufficiently sought credit for the economy.

 <textdata>
  Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, a Democrat, said Mr. Gore needed to talk more not only about the economy but also about what Mr. Bush could do to harm it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He's got to be very aggressive in talking about what Americans have at stake and how Bush's tax cut is very risky,'' Mr. Hunt said, adding that the economy needs ''to be the issue that brings the election home for Al Gore and the Democrats.''

  Several Democrats said that after the Democratic convention and into September, they were lulled into a sense of comfort that many voters had finally decided that Mr. Gore was the best candidate and that he had the edge with the president and a booming economy behind him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But they said they were now in the unexpected position of fighting to hang on to the White House in light of the vice president's lackluster debate performances and his failure to lay out his achievements, as well as the Bush campaign's attack on his credibility.
 </textdata>

  While many Democrats still predicted that Mr. Gore would prevail, as a group the vice president's party seemed more nervous than the Republicans. Leading Republicans were much less likely than Democrats to offer advice for Mr. Bush in the final week. It could be that the Republicans were more self-assured.

  ''I can understand the frustration of people,'' Mr. Fabiani said. ''But at the same time, everyone has to understand that Al Gore will be elected based upon his vision of the future. People naturally are going to give him credit for the last eight years. It doesn't help to be standing up and taking credit for yourself.''

  David Worley, chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, said it was important for Mr. Gore to campaign independently of Mr. Clinton.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He also argued that Mr. Gore should emphasize the economy and his role in its success. ''He needs to keep focusing on the issues and the economy,'' Mr. Worley said. ''As long as he does that he'll do fine.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some Democrats argued that if Mr. Gore had concentrated more on the economy, the Republicans would have had less success raising questions about his personality and stirring up the controversy over whether he embellishes facts.

  ''People are looking for something to finally resolve this personality thing,'' said Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, who counsels Mr. Gore to avoid attacking Mr. Bush harshly. ''He should just stay focused on the issues, be presidential in his manner without overdoing it, but definitely point out that he knows how to do the job and that he's results-oriented.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Feingold was not as harsh as other Democrats in saying that the vice president had squandered opportunities. In the wake of the impeachment, he said, he had convinced himself for a year and a half that Mr. Gore could never win because of the Clinton connection.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I think Gore has done as well as he could with the cards that were dealt him,'' he said. ''Don't you remember a year ago, a lot of the stories said, 'Gore is sinking like a stone.' They tried to write the guy off.''
 </textdata>

  There are a lot of laughs just now in Bush-Cheney country, where confidence about next week's election is so high that both Republican candidates felt they could take Sunday off. The Republicans' only campaign event was remarks by satellite by Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At a joint appearance in Wisconsin today, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presidential nominee, seemed barely able to contain himself, mugging, morphing, making funny faces at the crowd, his antics throwing Mr. Cheney's quiet-man persona into even greater relief -- and vice versa. (''What a solid citizen!'' Mr. Bush said of his vice-presidential pick.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the stump and off, he shows an open lack of respect for the competition that Mr. Gore does not reciprocate. And watching Messrs. Gore, Bush and Cheney campaign on back-to-back days only highlights the striking difference in tone, with Mr. Gore rarely mentioning his opponents by name.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He claimed he invented the Internet,'' Mr. Bush said again today, though that itself is an exaggeration of Mr. Gore's boast about his role in its development. Then he mocked Mr. Gore's statement that he is against big government. ''I knew the man was prone to exaggeration,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but not to that extent.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When he began by saying that the ''end to the Clinton-Gore era'' is around the corner, the crowd chanted: ''No More Gore! No More Gore!'' Standing behind him, Mr. Cheney's 6-year-old granddaughter, Kate Perry, waved a tiny American flag and booed at the mention of Mr. Gore's name.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cheney told the group, ''I was intrigued when I got to Memphis'' on a recent campaign swing. ''There were Al Gore and Joe Lieberman. I thought that was his home state. They have no home state! Maybe that's why they're in Washington, D.C.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Then he said, as he had before, that in the debates, Mr. Gore changed so radically from one occasion to the next that Mr. Bush was ''up against three different guys and he beat them all.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He ended by talking about his own favorite subject, the military. Mr. Gore disagrees with Mr. Cheney's view that the readiness of American troops has declined under the Clinton administration.

  The rally at the Paramount Theater, featuring a free concert by the singer Melissa Etheridge, was part of an increasingly energetic and even agitated campaign started by Mr. Gore's allies in the labor, environment, gay and women's movements.

  One women in the crowd, Jodi Mumford, of Olympia, Wash., said she was distressed by what she considered Mr. Bush's and Mr. Gore's lack of respect for lesbian rights. Although the speakers had made her ''think about'' her vote, she said she would probably stick with Mr. Nader.

  Nowhere is Democratic desperation more evident than in the liberals' savaging of Ralph Nader.

  Certainly the enthusiasm for Nader in ''safe'' Democratic states has given disaffected liberals a place to go other than to Bush.

  Who are these right-wing protest voters? Among them are hard-hat union types, frustrated at the support of Nafta by both Bush and Gore and the fecklessness of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. With the Reform Party split and the collapse of Buchanan's campaign, they have gravitated to Nader; the more the liberals attack him, the more that iso-conservatives are willing to overlook his far-out greenishness.

  Nader declares ''the use and sale of Social Security numbers by private firms and most government agencies should be banned.'' Gore says so, too, but Clinton has waffled. Bush's Senate ally, New Hampshire's Judd Gregg, is pushing a bill to exempt commercial snooping firms from state laws that would protect citizens from the sale of S.S.N.'s. Privacy advocates, long disillusioned by the Democratic White House, were stunned at how easily Republican leaders were manipulated by credit-agency lobbyists.

  Seemingly insensitive, her comment merely pointed up what teachers, administrators and parents in Texas have long known: that results on the TAAS, or the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test, are all important. As the presidential race grows tighter, this statewide standardized test, given yearly to public school children from third grade through high school, has achieved notoriety as well. A study released last week by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research group, claims that while Texas schoolchildren, particularly those from minority groups, have posted dramatic increases on their state test scores during George W. Bush's tenure as governor, their gains on a leading national exam have been less impressive. The rise in state scores,  researchers speculated, might reflect the practice of ''teaching to the test,'' that is, drilling children on  questions typical of those on the exam.

  What is more, if it appears that Vice President Al Gore is going to win New York easily -- this poll suggests that he is 21 points ahead of George W. Bush in New York, 52 percent to 31 percent -- then Democrats may not bother to turn out in the numbers Mrs. Clinton needs to win the race. If the percentage of voter turnout falls near 45 percent, then Mrs. Clinton's edge in the Times/CBS News Poll shrinks to just a few percentage points.

  But it was a departure of sorts for Archbishop Egan. Since his installation four months ago, he has largely maintained a low-key profile, although he did issue a statement on Oct. 1 against the federal Food and Drug Administration's approval of the abortion pill RU-486. He shied away from direct political commentary at the recent Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner, an annual archdiocesan event that drew Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Cardinal O'Connor had often used the dinner as a platform to express his political views.

  While no one knows for sure how much oil is below the permafrost, Mr. Bush, citing oil experts, says that the fields could produce a million barrels a day -- roughly the same amount, as he put it in the debate, as the country imports daily from Saddam Hussein, with whom his father went to war over protecting Middle East oil supplies.

  Al Gore and George W. Bush play it pathologically safe. The archive pictures of Trudeau reprinted after his death are a rogue's gallery of sartorial bravado. Half the time he looks more like a pimp than a prime minister. A fedora and cape for a football game. A full-length fur to go ice-skating. A white jacket with the collar spread way outside the lapel for a photo op with Ronald Reagan. Ascots, buckskin fringe jackets, striped sailor shirts, berets, Eskimo garb -- he pulled it all off. In the worst fashion excesses of the 70's, he still looks hip.

  Televised coverage of the Liberal Party convention at which Trudeau won the leadership was playing in the background of my sixth-birthday party.

  Tieless, in a blue shirt, and roaming the floor with a handheld microphone, Mr. Bush accused his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, of favoring ''Gore-gantuan government.'' He thundered that Mr. Gore ''likes Hillary-Care. He wants to nationalize the health care system of America.'' But Mr. Bush then perplexingly added, speaking of Mr. Gore, ''He wants the doctors making every decision on behalf of every patient in the country.'' (He usually says bureaucrats, not doctors.)

  Undaunted, Mr. Bush, campaigning in this west-central Florida city near Tampa, held a baby. He greeted a 102-year-old. And he did not miss a beat when a man yelled from the crowd and pre-empted his usual riff about the need for strong military. ''He took my punch line,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We need a speechwriter.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It came out as a meaningless array of numbers and addition. ''She starts to lose her earned income tax credit,'' Mr. Bush said. ''For the first time she's in the 15 percent bracket. When you add another 15 percent, or 16.2 percent, payroll tax on top of that, plus the 2.9, I mean the payroll tax and the Medicare tax, 16.4 percent, you end up with a high marginal rate. And that's not right, and that's not fair. And we're going to do something about it. We're going to drop the rate and lower the . . .''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Then trying again, Mr. Bush began spitting out numbers like a computer gone haywire, saying, ''15.3 percent, 12.4 and 2.9.'' (Only the real cognoscenti would know that he had just corrected his addition, putting together the 12.4 percent Social Security payroll tax and the 2.9 percent Medicare tax to get 15.3 percent.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I was trying to do some fuzzy math,'' Mr. Bush said, using the phrase he had repeated often during Tuesday's debate as a way of rebutting Mr. Gore's charges that Mr. Bush's tax cut disproportionately favors the wealthy. ''Yeah, I used his calculator. Then I used the real one.''

 <textdata>
  ''Well I really hadn't thought about it,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It's an interesting idea.'' A few seconds later he added, ''What I'm trying to do is get some more people to have $100 bills.''
 </textdata>

  10-8-2000

  Some politicians might get defensive about such tangles. Mr. Bush laughs at himself. At another town hall meeting, earlier this week, he brought up his propensity for scrambling words. ''Sometimes, you know, I might mangle a syl-LA-ble occasionally. Get it?'' he said breezily, deliberately putting the emphasis in the wrong place.

  When Mr. Bush unexpectedly held a news conference on an airport tarmac in Florida on Friday night, it was his first one since mid-September, when he was pummeled with questions about a Republican commercial attacking Mr. Gore's health care proposals in which the word ''rats'' flashes on the screen.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Never mind that Republicans had been sending out regular e-mail messages counting how many days the reporters on Mr. Gore's campaign plane had been held ''hostage'' without a news conference. (He held his first one in 67 days on Sept. 22.) To keep from stepping on his campaign message of the day, Mr. Bush adopted the same technique.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

 <textdata>
  Efforts to question him failed. When Mr. Bush appeared the day after the presidential debate with a police group to receive its endorsement, he waved off questions, saying ''I got questioned out last night.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Each day this week, aides to Mr. Bush have come back to the press section of the plane like a scouting party to see if the governor could come back for some unrecorded chatter. Each day reporters said no. Sometimes Mr. Bush took to standing in the alcove between the staff section of the plane and the press section, only to be rebuffed.

  Mr. Rebovich compared Mr. Corzine to Governor Bush, saying both lacked the ability to explain their policy positions in detail. ''With both, we're voting for kind of an image and a promise,'' he said. ''The assumption we make about Corzine is the same -- he doesn't know much, but he'll find good people to work for him.''

  Relations with Mr. Milosevic at  that period were never warm, but were at the height of a roller-coaster ride that coursed over a decade from a lack of attention during a Bush presidency distracted first by the fall of Communism elsewhere, and then by fighting Saddam Hussein, to outright war last year under President Clinton. Now, finally, Washington is celebrating the downfall of a man who for years delighted in defying, befuddling and belittling his far more powerful foes.

  From the beginning, these kinds of diplomatic differences marked Washington's relations with Yugoslavia. In 1990 and 1991, the ambassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmerman, felt that the Bush administration, distracted by the Persian Gulf war, made too little effort, too late, to stop the brewing conflict in Yugoslavia.

  Mr. Gore acknowledged today that he has made occasional factual mistakes, as when he said in Tuesday's debate that he had accompanied James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to inspect fire and flooding damage in Texas in 1998. Mr. Gore did visit Texas, but with one of Mr. Witt's deputies, not with Mr. Witt. Mr. Gore has said that he made the mistake because he has frequently made trips of that sort with Mr. Witt.

  In response to questions, Mr. Gore said that he did not have a tendency to embellish his resume and that his misstatements did not point to a deeper character flaw. He then tried to turn the tables, asserting that he does not make personal attacks against Mr. Bush when the governor misstates the facts. He went on to describe two such comments.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Gore said it ''could be characterized as an exaggeration'' when Mr. Bush said in the debate that the Gore campaign was outspending the Bush campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''But,'' Mr. Gore said, ''I didn't seize on that as anything other than a mistake that he made. When he said that there were 20,000 new bureaucrats called for in my budget plan, similarly I don't describe that as fictitious or an exaggeration. It's just a mistake on his part.''

 <textdata>
  ''These are negative personal attacks of the kind I simply do not engage in,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The Republican ticket announced a few weeks ago that they were going to adopt a new strategy of focusing on the issues, but they have completely abandoned that strategy and they are focused almost entirely on personal attacks.''

  Mr. Gore stood by his decision in the debate to illustrate the problem of school crowding by speaking of a 15-year-old girl in Sarasota, Fla., who had to stand in class. In fact, school officials have said, the girl was without a desk for only one day.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''They tried to make that out to be an exaggeration,'' Mr. Gore said of the Republicans. ''Well, excuse me, her father wrote me a handwritten letter, enclosing a picture on the front page of The Sarasota Herald Tribune of his daughter standing in class on the ninth day of school.''
 </textdata>

  10-8-2000

 <textdata>
  ''I stand by exactly what I said,'' Mr. Gore said today, ''that the instinct to involve them is not wrong but we did not want to invite them to be the mediator if they did not agree to the right outcome.''

  More than that, though, he has vigorously begun to distance himself from his party's presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, contending that the positions Mr. Bush has taken on issues like gun control and abortion are not only unpopular in his district but also at odds with Mr. Spano's beliefs.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Spano made it clear in an interview that he is seeking not only to draw distinctions between himself and Mr. Bush but also between himself and the Republican Party. ''My intention is to ask voters to look for Nick Spano on the ballot,'' he said. ''The only link I will have in this campaign is with my own record, not with any other candidate.''

  Mr. Gore has played a more prominent role than any other vice president in memory on a wide array of regulatory matters.  He has installed friends and former staff members to be top officials at the Federal Communications Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, and has directed the administration's response to a variety of legislative proposals that have been adopted or killed over the last eight years.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Gore has surrounded himself with campaign aides who had been top lobbyists for many major telecommunications businesses, including regional telephone companies, Internet service providers and software giants like Microsoft. But campaign officials say that if any of them ever joined a Gore administration, they would leave their associations with their former clients behind -- and that such relationships would not translate into policy changes.

  ''The differences would be dramatic,'' said Floyd Kvamme, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, the venture capital firm, who has been advising Gov. George W.

  To no one's surprise, Democratic and Republican campaign advisers said that on a wide range of issues -- from easing restrictions on computer technology exports to reshaping the nation's tort laws and making corporations more difficult to sue in product liability cases -- a Bush administration would be far friendlier to business than a Gore administration.

  Some advisers say the differences between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush in regulating businesses are as much a product of their careers as anything else.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The place to start is Bush's background as a businessman,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Federal Reserve governor appointed by Mr. Bush's father who is now Mr. Bush's top economic adviser. ''Gore has never been a businessman. Bush knows what it is to try to run a company and how frustrating regulation can be. The frustration comes not so much from complying with any particular rule, but from meeting the rules and yet still facing hurdles.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE'S advisers respond that Mr. Bush is too close to business interests, that in looking at issues through the lens of cost-benefit analysis he ignores greater public policy concerns, and that he would tend to favor corporate over consumer interests.

  ''It's inconceivable that a Bush administration's Environmental Protection Agency would in any meaningful way resemble the current E.P.A., which has been headed by a woman, Carol Browner, who had been on Al's staff and was Al's choice,'' said Reed E. Hundt, a close friend of Mr. Gore who was selected by the vice president to be the administration's first chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Or turn instead to the Food and Drug Administration,'' Mr. Hundt added. ''It's inconceivable that a Bush F.D.A. would mount the kind of attack on tobacco that the Gore F.D.A. had done, trying as it has to regulate the addictive content of cigarettes.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

 <textdata>
  Greg Simon, a top Gore adviser on regulatory and telecommunications issues, said it was naive for the Bush campaign to say the governor understands business issues simply because he was a businessman.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''George Bush failed in more businesses than he succeeded in,'' Mr. Simon said, a reference to Mr. Bush's time in the oil business. ''And Al Gore has probably spent more time with the leading businessmen than anyone I know. And our economic policies have created the greatest prosperity this nation has seen. The fact that Gore never ran a general store doesn't mean a whole lot.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The biggest difference between these two men is that Gore has a long and deep history and that he has done a lot of thinking on these issues, particularly telecommunications,'' he added. ''In a Bush administration, these issues are going to be delegated. No one really thinks that George W. Bush is going to be sitting around the Oval Office thinking about what our nation's telecommunications policy should be.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Consumer advocates agree that there would be many differences between the two administrations, although they also say they have been disappointed that Mr. Gore has been less of an ally in recent years than he was earlier in his career.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Bush isn't as extreme as the ideologues in his party and wouldn't throw out all antitrust laws, although he would clearly be less aggressive than a Gore administration,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. ''But the fact is in the last four years, we've had the most enormous consolidation of telephone monopolies, cable monopolies and media companies despite the administration's attack on Republican deregulation efforts that would allow even greater concentration of ownership. It's hard to understand why, in the last four years, Al Gore, who had such a strong history of fighting for consumer pocketbook issues, has suddenly come down with laryngitis on these issues.''

  Some of the firms are hoping that, even if Mr. Gore wins, they can run the clock until after Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., steps down. Mr. Levitt has said that the firms' consulting work poses a potential conflict of interest for their audit work.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  IN the broadcasting industry, the major television networks and media companies say they have received word from the Bush campaign that a Republican in the White House would mean scaling back -- and possibly eliminating -- ownership limits that have made it impossible for companies like Viacom's CBS and General Electric's NBC to grow any larger. The changes being floated by the Republicans would also repeal the rules that have made it difficult for a broadcaster to own a newspaper in the same city.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Telephone companies, too, are gearing up for new battles, particularly among the regional Bell companies, the long-distance carriers and the competitive local companies. There is a widespread view at the F.C.C. that a Republican leading that agency would make it significantly easier for the regional Bells to finally offer long-distance service in many states where they have so far failed to gain regulatory approval. The 1996 Telecommunications Act, which Mr. Gore played a large role in shaping, requires the regional Bell companies to open their local markets to competition before the federal government permits them to enter the $80 billion long-distance market.

  Antitrust enforcement, more vigorous under the Clinton administration than at any time since the 1960's, is also expected to undergo fundamental changes, but only if Mr. Bush wins. Both Democrats and Republicans say that the ideological divide between the parties in this area is narrower than at any time in decades, but that there would nonetheless be some major differences.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If there is a Gore administration, we're talking about more of the same,'' said Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, who in a Democratic administration would likely continue to head the agency at least through next summer. ''We've tried to carve out a middle ground which departs from the ideological warfare of the past. We are vastly more active than the Reagan years and somewhat more active than the Bush years.''

  For most mergers, there will almost certainly be no difference between a Gore administration and a Bush administration. But for some of the larger ones, particularly in the transportation and telecommunications industries, the differences may be stark.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Moreover, top advisers to Mr. Bush's campaign have been critical of several antitrust enforcement suits brought by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission under the Clinton administration.

  At a recent antitrust panel discussion in New York, Timothy J. Muris, a top Bush adviser on economic and competition issues, said the Clinton administration had opened too many cases involving accusations of monopolization.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A BUSH administration would have powerful allies on the issue in Congress. Republicans lawmakers have vowed to strip the F.C.C. of authority to review corporate mergers, a position also supported by some in the Bush campaign; such a change would make consolidation far simpler among telephone companies, broadcasters and technology concerns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The biggest changes that the F.C.C. would see would be in merger reviews, where there has been so much lobbying to get the agency out of that business,'' said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, which promotes diversity on the airwaves. ''Bush can be expected to resume the pattern established earlier, in the Reagan and Bush years, of looking at only competitive issues posed by these mergers, and not at the broader public interest questions, as the current administration has.''

  And that says nothing of what might happen in the Microsoft case, which is now on the docket of a Federal appeals court. Experts expect that a Gore administration would approach the case in the same way as the Clinton administration has. Advisers to Mr. Bush's campaign said they do not expect that his administration would do anything before the appeals court makes its decision, which could provide a wide range of opportunities to approach the case. Microsoft executives are hoping that a Bush administration  would dispose of the suit on terms far more favorable to the company than those proposed by the Clinton administration.
 </textdata>

  It is relatively easy to imagine what those agencies may be like if Mr. Gore wins, because he has already played the primary role in selecting many top regulators.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a Bush administration, the top contenders for senior regulatory jobs include a handful of Washington officials like Michael K. Powell, a widely respected Republican member of the F.C.C., and Texas regulators like Pat Wood III, chosen by Mr. Bush to run the state's Public Utilities Commission. Neither is viewed as an ideologue. And both have described their roles as reducing regulation while trying to promote competition in markets that have traditionally been controlled by monopolies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Wood has been Mr. Bush's top regulator in Texas for more than five years, and he has put into effect state and Federal laws aimed at deregulating both the telephone and utilities industries. Staking out pragmatic and moderate positions on regulatory issues, he has enjoyed good relations with both Democrats and Republicans on the F.C.C.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  IN a recent interview, Mr. Wood said he and Mr. Bush shared the view that there is a need for some regulation in markets that have historically been dominated by a handful of companies, until those markets open up.

  The first presidential debate of campaign 2000 was testy and confusing. The meeting between the vice-presidential contenders was somber and informative. Now those debates are over, we can see the broad outlines of the political drama that will play out over the next four weeks. Voters will be trying to figure out whether the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, is knowledgeable enough to be president, and whether the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore, is likable enough. To observe the personal nature of the choice between the candidates is not to denigrate the important role of issues like taxes, Social Security, health, education and defense. But anyone listening to the campaign dialogue on talk shows and at dinner tables has to be struck by the degree to which politically engaged people are focusing on the candidates' contrasting capabilities and personality traits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both candidates' knowledge about government and their individual psychologies have figured in making taxes a central issue of the campaign. Mr. Bush, for example, clings almost self-destructively to his tax cut of at least $1.3 trillion over 10 years, even though it allows Mr. Gore to attack the plan as absurdly weighted toward the wealthiest Americans. The governor may have needed to propose the tax cut to win conservatives' votes in the Republican primaries, but the issue has turned into an albatross this fall. If he can win on an issue so strongly identified with President George Bush, however, he will have vindicated the family honor. Moreover, if he can really deliver on tax cuts once in office, the younger Bush will have succeeded where his father failed. All politics may be local. But in this dynastic contest, it is hereditary as well. As often noted, Mr. Gore's warnings about tax breaks for the richest Americans hark back to the New Deal populism of his father, Albert Gore Sr.

  Speaking of father figures, how about those vice-presidential candidates. For the first time since his selection for the Republican ticket, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney looked like an asset on Thursday night. Mr. Cheney's solid debate performance and his ability to talk about subjects that make Mr. Bush look tongue-tied carries the risk of diminishing the man at the top of the ticket. Even so, Mr. Cheney's steadiness may also pull in voters who find Mr. Bush attractive but are worried that he is too callow to be chief executive. Joseph Lieberman, for his part, showed mature judgment in letting Mr. Cheney make his points without feeling compelled to imitate Mr. Gore's combative debating style.

  But the No. 2's have had their day. In the upcoming debates, it will be purely up to Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to close the sale. The vice president probably remains the best-informed candidate running in the United States this year for any office. But with his new nonverbal vocabulary of sighs, grimaces and interruptions, he has managed to turn  that asset into an irritation and thereby flatten his lead in the polls. Even some supporters wondered whether his performance might foretell difficulties as president in drawing Americans to his side in moments of decision and crisis.

  In the end, Mr. Bush showed last Tuesday that he can avoid defeating himself with gaffes and factual blunders. But in the second and third debates, he will have to show that he can move beyond repetitive accusations of ''fuzzy math'' and smoothly expound authoritative numbers of his own. As our colleague William Safire observed, Mr. Bush at some point has to win by winning, especially since he wants to persuade the American people to change course at a time of extraordinary prosperity.

  On balance, Mr. Bush had a lucky week. Mr. Gore made mistakes on a few trivial matters, masking Mr. Bush's shaky grasp of the cost of his tax cut, his Social Security proposal and his own campaign. He may not be so fortunate on Wednesday night. It will be hard to get by on generalities about big government if Mr. Gore can draw him into a detailed and sigh-free discussion of budgetary and foreign policy issues.

How surprising, then, that those voters have had their hearts broken in two consecutive debates, as they watched first a lackluster defense of the sanctity of life, and then a surrender on the defense of traditional marriage.

  About five minutes into the debate, Mr. Bush bragged about his harmonious relations with them in Texas. A minute or so after that, he looked forward to a similar situation in Washington.

  It just sounds odd. Given how unpredictable the presidential race remains with so little time to go, Mr. Bush might have been expected to demonize the people across the aisle. That has been the strategy of many Republicans since the Reagan years, raised to an art by Lee Atwater and Newt Gingrich.

  Mr. Bush, according to several political analysts and some of his advisers, is using this shift to find ways to assert an advantage over Mr. Gore. Since Mr. Bush cannot say he has as much experience as the vice president, who has held public office for nearly a quarter-century, he is suggesting that less is more. Dwelling on a vision of cooperation in the future highlights its absence in the present and tacitly indicts everyone in Washington -- including Mr. Gore -- for letting bipartisanship languish.

  ''There is this implicit accusation that Gore is so marinated in the bitterness of Washington D.C., there's no way he can get things done,'' said one of Mr. Bush's advisers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's message that he will bridge the divide between Republicans and Democrats is also a way of saying that he is an outsider, a claim of questionable credibility but undeniable political acumen.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Clinton, another state governor, at least partly took this tack in 1992. He referred to himself then as ''a different kind of Democrat.''  The Bush campaign has dubbed its candidate ''a different kind of  Republican.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Voters want someone who straddles the vital center, and by promoting his ability to collaborate with Democrats, Mr. Bush is trying to position himself there.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Interestingly, when Mr. Bush recently charged that Mr. Gore would use the projected surplus with as much restraint as Imelda Marcos used her Neiman Marcus card, he made a point of stating that plenty of other Democrats -- including Mr. Clinton -- had seen the fiscally prudent light. The problem, as Mr. Bush defined it, was not the opposing party, but rather its nominee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

 <textdata>
  With his talk of bipartisanship, Mr. Bush is also saying that a person's political loyalty is not the most important thing about him. And that carries a potential meaning that is larger than politics.

  ''It addresses the whole element of compassion,'' said one of Mr. Bush's advisers, alluding to Mr. Bush's self-identification as a ''compassionate conservative.'' Calling for a truce among rival tribes signals an open heart and an open mind, or least the Bush campaign intends it to.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

 <textdata>
  And yet many political analysts said that there were inherent problems in Mr. Bush's approach. For starters, his positions themselves hold less hope for bipartisan compromise than his words, which may be  fig leaves covering very conservative ideological positions.

  His proposed tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years is larger than what even conservative Republican members of the House were pushing over the last two years. His ideas for increasing the number of Americans with health insurance, building more houses for lower-middle-class people and bringing down the cost of fuel all involve measures that emphasize corporate competition and profit rather than government regulation. And on issues like abortion and gun control, Mr. Bush is either decidedly or arguably right of center.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Similarly, Mr. Bush's styling of himself as an outsider, while in line with three of the last four presidents -- Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, governors all -- could be hard for him to carry off. His surname is a constant reminder of the favor he was able to curry with the Republican establishment, and of the support he draws from it.
 </textdata>

  BUT Mr. Bush must use whatever advantages he has, and he and his advisers have always felt he maintains an edge on Mr. Gore in terms of sheer likability, which weighs heavily with some voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's promotion of himself as a congenial, inspiring leader works that vein, especially in contrast to Mr. Gore, who is seen by some voters and colleagues as the ultimate partisan attack dog.

  There were dueling prescription drug plans for the elderly and education plans to woo the suburban soccer moms. Mr. Gore's denunciations of ''tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent'' of Americans were aimed at the lower middle class, while Mr. Bush's rejected ''old-style Washington politics'' in a bid for independents.

  Next came the post-debate blizzard of media polls. MSNBC, with the help of the Republican pollster Frank Luntz, had 36 avowedly undecided voters in the swing state of Missouri using dials to record their reaction to every word of the debate. Fox News and SpeakOut.com were running a ''Rate the Debate'' forum via the Internet. CBS's online poll proclaimed Mr. Gore the winner by 56 to 42 percent. NBC's overnight poll gave it to Mr. Gore 46 percent to 36 percent. And ABC's snap poll said that Mr. Gore had won 42 percent to 39 percent. (In a bracing moment of on-air rebellion the ABC anchor Peter Jennings announced and then brazenly dismissed his own network's instant telephone poll as unscientific and meaningless).

  Mr. Gore was seen as wooden and, horror of horrors, as poll driven. Many thought he was fading from the race. Yet come September, as the polls shifted, Mr. Bush became the hapless one, his malapropisms fatal and his aides reactive, while Mr. Gore had metamorphosed into a bold risk taker gleaming with a winner's confidence. ''I've called it for Gore,'' Lawrence O'Donnell Jr., a contributing editor for New York Magazine, said on the ''Hardball'' television show. ''I think he's unstoppable at this point.''

  He noted that an astute student of polls in the spring, instead of ordaining Mr. Bush, would have recognized that public opinion was not fixed. ''You would have seen how much volatility there was,'' Mr. Kohut said, ''that you can't trust this Bush lead.''

  If there is one bright spot this year, it may be that the voters themselves almost seem like they want to confound everyone. Just when Mr. Gore looked like he was out of the race, the public swung his way. When Mr. Bush appeared in danger of permanently falling behind, he caught up. ''People are contrarian in a certain way,'' Mr. Kristol said, celebrating the twists and turns of this year's race. ''They keep wanting to do the opposite of what the polls tell them they want to do. The voters are less susceptible to herd mentality than the pundits.''

  Horowitz: I don't know. One of the best debate teams I ever saw used to write down their jokes before a tournament. I think the same may be true for Bush and Gore in terms of key phrases. In terms of persuasive flourishes, how you hold yourself in a debate, making eye contact, things like that, you're right: you can't really practice that. You can't look in the mirror and go, ''Ooh, I look credible today.''

  ''The biggest thing people are worried about is who's going to be in office,'' Dr. Naqvi said. His analysis: If Al Gore is elected, as he expects, and the Democrats gain control in Congress, drug stocks could fall 20 percent on fears of Mr. Gore's plan to change the Medicare system. By limiting some drug prices, that plan could reduce drug company earnings by 5 percent to 8 percent. But as long as the Republicans keep control of Congress, drug stocks will rise in the fourth quarter. And if George W. Bush is elected as well, that gain could be 20 percent.

  In those days, too, there was talk of ''democratic values.'' In practice, though, those values won out in policy debates only when they converged with cold war interests -- like containing Cuba, overthrowing Nicaragua's Sandinistas or stemming the rise of Salvadoran leftist rebels. The heyday of doing business with generals and dictators was the 1950's, 1960's and early 1970's. Then the Carter, Reagan and Bush administrations incorporated the sponsorship of free elections into their playbooks for keeping leftists out of power. With confidence in  electorates that were not radical, they helped support Latin America's dramatic emergence from the era of military rule. So by the time  President Clinton was proclaiming his support for democracy, he was in the morally comfortable position of dealing almost exclusively with civilian presidents.

  The situation recalled the fall of Panama's General Noriega, who would do favors for the White House  one day and for Fidel Castro the next, until President Bush finally pushed him from power. Mr. Montesinos, like General Noriega, also shamelessly flaunted his closeness to Americans in order to enhance his power at home. In 1998, when another scandal threatened, he practically ambushed retired Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug czar, in order to appear on Peruvian television shaking his hand during an official visit.

  The trapping war began in 1986, when William Mannetti of New Haven, who founded the Animal Rights Front, and Joy Bush of Hamden, another member of the group, got trapping licenses. That year, the two won four-year trapping rights on two sites. The next time the state took bids, in 1990, they won four sites; in 1994, a growing group of anti-trappers got 10. In 1998, the clandestine war escalated. Anti-trappers won 36 sites totaling 47,000 acres of public land.

  Vice President Gore (second from right): ''Tipper had come in during the briefing, and so when we started breaking up to go outside to the South Lawn for the official arrival, we finally got to say hi to each other. I wasn't self-conscious at all. I didn't think anybody else was paying attention to us. I was just thinking, 'I'm really glad to see you and I love you.' This was a time of incredible transition in our lives. We were finally coming to grips with the fact that our first daughter was about to go from being our little girl to somebody else's wife. It is a strange fact of the vice presidency, or any elected office, that your personal life becomes intertwined with your public one. It's something I'm not sure you ever quite grow used to.''

  ''He is an artist of spaces,'' says Shamina Talyarkhan, the owner of a hand-beaded-embroidery company that supplies couture fashion houses. Talyarkhan handed Bush the keys to her awkwardly proportioned modern penthouse on the Upper East Side and came home to a shimmering, stone-colored space dotted with handmade silver tables and Jaipur miniatures. ''The reasons I adore him are simple,'' she adds. ''First, he has exquisite taste.

  A postmodern staircase in garish orange pearwood and brass? Bush gave it a Zen makeover using ebony stain and a dose of bronze finishing, until it looked like something Marlene Dietrich might have descended in ''Shanghai Express.'' A bedroom swathed in sweet-tempered, tea-green silk in the same Upper East Side apartment now has unexpected backbone: black Chinese tables and an unconventional headboard composed of towering 19th-century panels of French black and gold lacquer.

  In his own apartment -- a bijou one-bedroom whose tidy exoticism is one part Goncourt brothers to two parts ''Arabian Nights'' -- stacks of books are stored behind ceiling-high folding screens upholstered in Mughal woodblock-print cotton. And the gossamer silk bedroom curtains are edged in lowly black rickrack trim that, in Bush's hands, becomes suddenly chic. Even more startling is the fact that he made them himself.
 </textdata>

  The apartment is a three-dimensional album of influences, its two small rooms filled with objects imbued with personal meaning. ''I like to surround myself with things that remind me of people I've known or admired,'' Bush says. Which accounts for such evocative ephemera as an envelope decorated by the ''Madeline'' illustrator, Ludwig Bemelmans, and addressed to the decorator Elsie de Wolfe; a pair of polychrome Russian side chairs that belonged to the great, eccentric Parisian designer Madeleine Castaing; and a small portrait of Stephen Tennant, a British socialite whose heavy makeup and passion for sailors and seashells made him an icon of alternative chic in the 1920's. A 19th-century French shawl conceals an old Singer sewing-machine base found in a shop in Pennsylvania. Though nothing special, it serves its purpose as a table. More than a practical solution, it is a subtle emblem of why Bush's clients feel they can trust him to stick to their budgets, even if they've been burned by other decorators in the past.

  ''We've heard about designer scams a lot lately, but he's not going to embroil you in multimillion-dollar pieces of furniture -- unless that's what you want,'' says Claudia Cohen, the entertainment reporter for ''Live With Regis,'' who has been a Bush client for more than a decade. (He's working on her house in the Hamptons, and recently completed a screening room in her Manhattan apartment.) ''He's scrupulously honest, and a gentleman, too -- kind and gracious and honorable.'' And he has his priorities straight, Cohen adds. ''He'll show you a world-class, museum-quality antique for the living room, and in the same meeting, flip through the Pottery Barn catalog and find the perfect table for your guest room.''

  ''I come from simple stock,'' Bush says by way of explanation. ''My mama did not wear couture.'' But what his mother lacked in high fashion, she made up for in valuable life lessons. ''She taught me to see,'' Bush says, whether it was vegetables at the produce stand or old furniture at a local antique show. ''She taught me to pick out things that had the nicest shape, that were painted with the best symmetry. If I can tell a bad painting from a good painting, it's because of my mother.''

  A 10-year stint under the wing of the society architect Peter Marino didn't hurt, either. ''Peter is obsessed with quality,'' says Bush, who went solo three years ago, after working on projects for the arts patron Anne Bass and the fashion designer Valentino. ''And so am I.''

  His quest for the best doesn't mean riding roughshod over a client's desires. One woman told him, ''I know you don't think I have good taste, but this is what I like,'' apologizing for her insistence on a teeth-aching color scheme of peach and green.

''When we met, there was this instant rapport, we were kindred spirits,'' Lady de Rothschild adds. ''He knows the history of everything: period furniture, fashion, people. So when we're together, we go off on these long conversations.''

  To Bush, a room should reflect its occupant. ''Everybody's trying so hard to be stylish, everybody's too overly design conscious,'' he says, recalling the cognoscenti's disappointment when Jacqueline Onassis's legendarily luxurious apartment turned out to be merely pretty in photographs published after her death. ''People said it was so ugly, so dull, but I thought it was perfect. It was the backdrop to a fascinating woman. Rooms shouldn't compete with the people who live in them.'' And, he adds, eyes widening in astonishment, ''since when has 'pretty' been a dirty word?''

  His look? He doesn't have a label for what he does, and doesn't want one, though one observer called it tradition-with-a-twist. Bush isn't so sure, but he accepts the description -- for now. ''I'm still formulating what I'm doing, where I'm going,'' he says. ''I'm always learning. I never want to lose that.''

  EARLY this year, when Vice President Al Gore was ostensibly under the stylistic tutelage of the writer Naomi ''release-your-inner-alpha-male'' Wolf, he showed up in New Hampshire for a primary debate with Bill Bradley looking more like someone trying to sign Minnie Driver to a three-picture deal than a politician aiming to lead the free world. On Jan. 26, Mr. Gore wore a snug three-button suit that wasn't quite dark enough, a shirt of French blue that appeared at once too French and too blue, and a horizontally striped tie. The look brought a rejoinder from DNR, the men's wear trade journal, deploring ''fashion offenses bordering on the impeachable.''

  DNR made much of the fact that the vice president had buttoned the top button of his jacket. But the real transgression was his stab at flashiness, which his rivals in the Democratic primary seized on as cause for optimism. ''One of the things we thought Bradley had going for him was that Gore was too fashion-forward,'' said Richard Stengel, one of Mr. Bradley's consultants at the time. ''He could look natty, and natty isn't presidential.''

  EARLY this year, when Vice President Al Gore was ostensibly under the stylistic tutelage of the writer Naomi ''release-your-inner-alpha-male'' Wolf, he showed up in New Hampshire for a primary debate with Bill Bradley looking more like someone trying to sign Minnie Driver to a three-picture deal than a politician aiming to lead the free world. On Jan. 26, Mr. Gore wore a snug three-button suit that wasn't quite dark enough, a shirt of French blue that appeared at once too French and too blue, and a horizontally striped tie. The look brought a rejoinder from DNR, the men's wear trade journal, deploring ''fashion offenses bordering on the impeachable.''

  Of all the critiques one might make of the performance Mr. Gore and his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, gave on Tuesday in the first presidential debate -- overuse of the terms ''lockbox'' and ''fuzzy math,'' for example -- nattiness isn't one of them.

  Were Vice President Gore and Governor Bush playing it too safe in this tightly contested race? Were they afraid that anything veering from the mundane would send voters on the fence fleeing in the wrong direction? ''The tie shouldn't be too distracting,'' said Michael Deaver, the former adviser to President Ronald Reagan (a radical proponent of brown suits), commenting on the unwritten rules of debate wear. ''But it doesn't have to be quite as boring as solid red.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  All that said, to students of men's fashion, namely those able to identify hopsacking in a line-up, there were key differences. ''Men's wear is all about the nuances,'' said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. ''They looked the same, but in terms of what the clothing means, they're worlds apart.'' Vice President Gore wore a three-button suit, and his shoulders were softer, connoting more of a European sensibility than the governor's stiffer two-button affair.
 </textdata>

  Please note, also, that the spread between the points of the vice president's shirt collar was far narrower than the one on Governor Bush. The governor's ''modified spread'' is generally considered a more conservative look.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

 <textdata>
  And then there is the controversial matter of cuff links: the vice president avoided them, Governor Bush did not. ''Democratic candidates can't wear cuff links,'' Mr. Stengel pointed out. ''It looks too luxe, too country club, too 1-percent-ish.''

  The setting is Southern California in 2025. The environment has been ravaged by pollution, plunder and global warming. (Apparently Al Gore lost the 2000 election.) Meat and fish are rarities, the forests have been leveled, and the climate careers between drought and unending, vicious rainstorms. A handful of nearly extinct animal species are kept on the sprawling estate of Maclovio Pulchris, a pop star modeled on Michael Jackson, while Tyrone O'Shaughnessy Tierwater, onetime heroic eco-warrior and now aged ex-con, manages the motley menagerie of hyenas, wart hogs, foxes and lions. A call from his former comrade in arms (and ex-wife), Andrea Knowles Cotton Tierwater, prompts in Tierwater memories of the heyday of Earth Forever!, an environmental action group modeled on Earth First!, in the late 1980's and 1990's. Flipping back and forth between the present and past, Boyle fills us in bit by bit on Tierwater's back story, which, in fact, provides the novel's slim narrative momentum save for some ''Bringing Up Baby'' high jinks with animals.

  Mr. Sakai came from a family descended from Samurai, Japan's ancient warrior class. He was taught to live by the code of Bushido, which he defined in his book, ''Samurai!'' published in 1957 by E. P. Dutton, as living so as to always be prepared to die.

  Saburo Sakai was born in Saga, on the island of Kyushu, in 1916 to a family that had turned to farming as changing economic and social conditions led to the passing of the warrior class. The family was poor, but intensely proud of their Samurai heritage, according to Mr. Sakai's book. And as Japanese militarism surged in the 30's, so did the popularity of the old Bushido ideology.

  Never mind that very few politicians, pundits or other political professionals, in this state or elsewhere, thought that Mr. Bush had won a ''smashing victory'' over Vice President Al Gore. Most considered the outcome more like a draw, with an edge, perhaps, to Mr. Gore on substance and to Mr. Bush on demeanor.  But whatever the result, the underlying reality is that Pennsylvania Republicans have little reason for exuberance about this year's race for the White House.

  When they are not uttering brave, morale-boosting words for public consumption, Republican politicians concede that with about 4 1/2 weeks until Election Day, Mr. Bush faces a steep uphill fight here. One respected poll shows him 12 percentage points behind, and another puts him 4 back.  Most professionals sense that the real margin must be in between.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  And that has national significance.  Pennsylvania, whose 23 electoral votes are the country's fifth-largest prize, has been one of a half-dozen or so major battlegrounds from the start of the 2000 campaign. If it slips from Mr. Bush's grasp, he will have to win Florida and most of the other swing states -- like Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio -- to win a majority in the Electoral College.

  ''Unless something amazing happens, and I really can't imagine what it might be, Pennsylvania is a lost cause for Bush,'' said Prof. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University, west of Lancaster, Pa. ''It's starting to look an awful lot like 1992 and 1996. Nine percent for Bill Clinton, both times, and about the same for Gore.''

  Mr. Bush's biggest problem lies here in the Philadelphia suburbs, in the four counties that form a semicircle around the city, from Bucks in the north through Montgomery and Chester to Delaware in the south.  When Republicans like Mr. Ridge and the state's senior senator, Arlen Specter, do well, they almost always run strongly in the suburbs, helping to offset the usual big Democratic vote in Philadelphia.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Private polls taken recently for local candidates show Mr. Gore doing nearly as well, with a chance, in the view of one Democratic strategist, of breaking even in the four-county region, losing lopsidedly Republican Chester but winning Montgomery by a solid margin.

  ''Gore's hard to like,'' Professor Madonna said, ''but his stands on the issues fit the suburbs. Bush is having trouble with Republican women there, especially the younger ones, and with independents. A lot of it is abortion. It may not be at the top of the agenda, it may not be what they talk about first, but it's there. It's always there, and it certainly hurts Bush.''

  Pennsylvania has relatively few registered independents, and Democrats outnumber Republicans on voter rolls by more than 474,000, according to the latest tally. So it is obviously crucial for any statewide Republican candidate to hold every vote in his partisan base. Mr. Bush is in trouble here because he has failed to do that, at least so far.

  Four weeks ago, Mr. Bush came to Pennsylvania, a state with an unusually large number of old people -- second only to Florida, by some reckonings -- to announce his prescription drug plan. Mr. Gore was pounding away at him on the health care issue. But older people, the polls indicate, have continued to drift toward the Democrats, perhaps because Mr. Gore's drug plan is simpler and relies less on H.M.O.'s and drug companies, both unpopular in the state.

  West Chester, Radnor, Doylestown and the other suburbs tend to be moderate places. Mr. Ridge, not a particularly partisan governor, is especially popular here. So Mr. Bush's emphasis during the debate on his record of working successfully with both parties went down well.

  Mr. Bush worked hard during the debate to allay suburban women's fears about his opposition to abortion. When Mr. Gore charged that his rival would ''appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade,'' the Supreme Court decision upholding a woman's right to choose an abortion, Mr. Bush replied that ''voters should assume that I have no litmus test'' on abortion when nominating judges.

  The Texan also gave a decidedly soft-edged answer to a question from the moderator of the debate, Jim Lehrer, when Mr. Lehrer asked whether Mr. Bush, if elected, would try to overturn last week's decision by the Food and Drug Administration allowing doctors dispense RU-486, an abortion-inducing pill.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  While he was ''disappointed'' by the decision, Governor Bush commented, he doubted that a president had the power to overturn such a decision (although the F.D.A. commissioner serves at the pleasure of the president). He added mildly, ''I hope the F.D.A. took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.''

  When the vice president traveled to the area on Memorial Day, Lou Lignelli, the district director for Representative Frank R. Mascara, a Democrat, listened to his rather lackluster speech and commented unhappily, ''Gore just doesn't have it.'' By this week, Mr. Lignelli had changed his mind. He said he thought Mr. Gore could stage a blowout in the region and state.

  ''The Gore campaign got its act together,'' he said. ''They moved to Nashville, they got themselves a better campaign manager, and then Gore picked Lieberman for vice president.

  Still, Mr. Novak promised that Mr. Bush would be back to Pennsylvania at least once every week until the election. His father, former President George Bush, who ran strongly in southeastern Pennsylvania in 1988 and narrowly carried the state, is due in the state next week.

  Mr. Gore is running comfortably ahead in the polls in California, in part because it is one of the few places where he is holding his own or slightly ahead among men, who tend here to be more liberal than their counterparts in the South and Midwest. But even here, Mr. Gore runs behind Mr. Bush among white men and married men, and the car quiz sums up what may be one of his biggest challenges as the presidential race moves into its final month: how to get guys who may not be like him to like him all the same.

  So this year, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have gone out of their way to demonstrate their sensitive New Age guyness by gushing with Oprah Winfrey and praising their wives' uplifting influences. In their debate on Tuesday, Mr. Bush, who like most Republicans does worse with women than his Democratic opponent, went so far as to brag about crying with Texas flood victims. ''That's what governors do,'' he said.

  But men, especially white men, remain a potent political force, perhaps even more complicated to court. And among this group, Mr. Gore is struggling, trailing Mr. Bush among men over all by 22 points in one recent Los Angeles Times national poll and by smaller but still significant margins in most other surveys. At the same time, Mr. Gore has not been doing well enough among women, especially married women, to be certain he will be able to offset his deficit among men.

  Mr. Gore has made his share of efforts to appeal to men. He promotes himself as the repository of fiscal responsibility and deficit reduction. His biographical advertisements are careful to note his Army service in Vietnam. Even his celebrated kiss of his wife, Tipper, at the Democratic convention, pollsters say, could be seen as much as a gesture of solidarity with his fellow family men as an appeal to women.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But political professionals in both parties say Mr. Gore also faces particular problems growing out of his earnest, wonkish personality, and his tendency to lecture. ''One of the things that I think is happening is that Bush has been able to convey and project a personality type that I think appeals to men,'' Mr. South said, ''a kind of free-wheeling, macho guy, more compatible with where the typical white, middle-aged male voter would be than Gore has.''

  ''Before it was always, 'Can he stare down the Soviet Union?' '' Ms. Fitzpatrick said. ''Now it's, 'Is he like me and do I like him?' And with Al Gore the answer to both is no. Clinton is always looked at as having an outstretched hand, and Gore as having a pointing finger.''

  Robert DeSouza, 60, a disabled former appliance repairman in Sacramento, still calls himself a Democrat but says he has voted Republican since Richard M. Nixon's election in 1968. He is not a big fan of Mr. Bush but says Mr. Gore could not persuade him to vote Democratic.

  In fact, according to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, taken late last month, Mr. Gore is doing about the same among men as Mr. Clinton did in 1992 and 1996, drawing the support of about 4 in 10  male voters, though other polls have shown him faring worse.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore is so far not doing as well among women as Mr. Clinton did, drawing the support of just 47 percent of likely female voters in the most recent Times/CBS News poll. When Mr. Clinton was elected in 1996, he won the support of 54 percent of women, surveys of voters leaving the polls found.
 </textdata>

  Moreover, before Mr. Clinton's affair with a White House intern and his subsequent impeachment took its toll, the president had managed to make strong inroads of support among the kinds of blue-collar families that the Democrats had been ceding for years. These are among the voters Mr. Gore is trying to reclaim with his oratorical emphasis on ''working families.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

  But here, too, Mr. Gore faces problems caused in part by Mr. Clinton's alienation of these voters, and in part by Mr. Gore's having spent much of the winter running to the left to stave off a primary challenge from Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. At the same time, he may suffer in stylistic comparisons with Mr. Clinton, who is a past master at creating connections with his audience, whatever it happens to be.

  ''If he was asked about gay marriage, for example, the typical Clinton response lays out right away, 'I do not favor gay marriage,' '' said one Democratic strategist here who has complained to Mr. Gore about this point. ''And then he segues into a sympathetic-sounding response about how we have to uphold everybody's differences and dreams. Gore's tendency is to give the long, sympathetic answer, and then, as an afterthought, add, 'Having said that, I do not favor gay marriage.' ''

 <textdata>
  ''The issues that Bush is raising have a certain appeal for young men, like Social Security, where he says I'll give you the right to invest some of your own funds,'' Mr. DiCamillo said. ''When you poll the attitudes of the young, they basically have much less trust in government to be there when they need it, and the farther you are away from retirement age, the more likely you are to be skeptical about whether the government will deliver. I also think the entrepreneurial spirit, the kind that drives the booming California economy right now, that spirit is more reflected by Bush in his economic proposals. The key question to me nationally is, will these young people go out and vote?''

  ''In a sense, this is the single biggest issue before the country in this election in terms of differences between the two candidates,'' said William E. Leuchtenberg, a history professor at the University of North Carolina. ''Here you have two candidates who are in a number of other respects fighting for the center, but in this issue their points of views are sharply defined, with Bush certain to name conservatives to the bench and Gore prepared to choose more liberal judges.''

  Traditionally, the issue of court appointments has had little effect in modern presidential elections. Yet each side has a small but highly motivated constituency on this issue, and Governor Bush, of Texas, and Vice President Gore have given unmistakable signals, as they did Tuesday night, to those groups as to how they would pick judicial nominees.
 </textdata>

  Nonetheless, the candidates have left little doubt in the messages they are sending to their supporters. Governor Bush discovered in the primary season that indirect assurances that he would name only reliable conservatives were not sufficient. That was because the influential group of Republicans eagerly hoping to gain control of the White House and the nominating procedure has adopted ''No More Souters'' as its private slogan, one G.O.P. adviser said.

  The reference is to Justice David H. Souter, who has proved to be emblematic to conservatives of disappointment and even ideological betrayal. Justice Souter was nominated by President George Bush in 1990 with assurances to conservatives that despite his meager record as a federal appeals court judge, he would prove a reliable member of the court's conservative coalition. Instead, he has often voted with the court's liberal bloc.

  Governor Bush, after meeting with his advisers, decided to offer an explicit and hard-to-mistake signal and said that the justices he most admired were Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are widely viewed as the court's two most resolute conservatives and reliable foes of court rulings extending abortion rights.

  ''The voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench, people who will strictly interpret the Constitution and will not use the bench to write social policy,'' Governor Bush said Tuesday night. ''I don't believe in liberal, activist judges; I believe in strict constructionists, and those are the kind of judges I will appoint.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore responded: ''In my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with the -- with our country and our history. I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment. And when the phrase 'strict constructionist' is used, and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying that the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade,'' the 1973 ruling that first found a constitutional right to abortion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

  Mr. Gore said his appointees would ''have a philosophy that I think would make it quite likely'' that they would uphold the Roe decision.

  One Bush adviser said that to deal with the ''no more Souters'' issue, a new Republican administration would try to choose candidates with established records on the major issues. Lawyers who are advising Governor Bush said in interviews that his most likely models for appointing judges were his father, President Bush, and President Ronald Reagan, both of whom turned the process over to a group of committed conservatives.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is far less clear that Mr. Gore would closely follow President Clinton's approach in choosing judges. Mr. Clinton generally chose lawyers with moderate philosophical leanings and did not try to provide a counterweight to the previous 12 years in which Republicans sought to turn the courts rightward.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

  Many liberal advocacy groups are hopeful that Mr. Gore would be bolder than Mr. Clinton in his court choices.

  ''For example, if Gore won, it's possible Rehnquist might try to hang on,'' he said. ''Whereas he might be inclined to leave and turn over the process of choosing his successor to Bush.''

  One thing the guess lists of both candidates have in common is the presence of Hispanic candidates, as it is generally believed that both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore would like to reap the credit for naming the first Hispanic member of the court.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Other possible Hispanic nominees for a Gore White House would be Judge Fortunato P. Benavides, 53, a federal appeals court judge in Austin, Tex., and Judge Sonia Sotomayor, 46, a federal appeals court judge in New York.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Other possible Supreme Court nominees in a Gore administration include two members of the appeals court in Washington, Judge David S.  Tatel, 58, and Judge Merrick B. Garland, 47. Another leading candidate would be Walter E. Dellinger, 59, a former solicitor general and constitutional scholar.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000

  Lawyers close to Governor Bush say their leading Hispanic candidate would be Emilio M. Garza, 53, an appeals court judge in San Antonio.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another favorite with the conservative lawyers who would be influential in a Bush administration is Judge Jerry E. Smith, 53, a federal appeals court judge in Houston. Other candidates include Judge Edith H. Jones, 51, who sits on the same court as Judge Smith, and Judge Frank H. Easterbrook, 52, an appeals court judge in Chicago who is a leading judicial exponent of the so-called law and economics school.

  Abortion rights advocates and Mr. Gore have asserted that the court is one vote away from sharply curtailing the right to an abortion, though that is probably an exaggeration. There are only three solid votes on the court to overturn Roe: Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas. Justice Kennedy has usually sided with the liberal bloc and Justice O'Connor to form a 6-to-3 majority that is generally in favor of abortion rights. Justice Kennedy sided, however, with the conservative minority in last term's 5-to-4 ruling striking down a Nebraska law outlawing a form of late-term abortion.

  Candidates Are Working To Close the Gender Gap  Vice President Al Gore is safely ahead among women, who since at least 1980 have tended to vote liberal and Democratic, but over all, men prefer Gov. George W. Bush -- in one poll likening him to a Maserati and Mr. Gore to a Volvo. Each candidate is trying to bridge the gender gap by tinkering with his image.

  Mr. Schweitzer has run several drug commercials, including the one in which he compares the prices with those of pet medicines. It was reminiscent of a statement by Mr. Gore that his mother-in-law paid three times as much for an arthritis medicine as he did for the drug for his dog. (The Gore campaign later acknowledged the anecdote was based on a Congressional study.)

  When Gov. George W.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The debate has emerged as so consequential, in fact, that operatives for Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush said they had suspended many important strategic decisions, at least until Wednesday, so they could gauge whether the fundamental dynamics of the contest have been shifted. Those decisions include where to buy advertising and where, precisely, the candidates should be deployed in the final weeks of the campaign.

  Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, played down the debates a few weeks back, saying they tended only to reinforce voters' support of one candidate or another.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Officials involved in the negotiations said that they had not been particularly contentious, but that the Gore representatives -- who had more collective background in debate talks -- were more aggressive in making demands, though not all were met.''A lot of this was head-fake stuff,'' said a person involved in the talks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign had one victory before the negotiations began:  the Bush organization had abandoned its objections to having all three events sponsored by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. (The commission will also sponsor the vice-presidential debate in Danville, Ky., on Thursday.) Bush representatives had also opposed Boston as the site of the first debate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For example, the Gore negotiators pressed, unsuccessfully, for the candidates to be able to wear lapel microphones in the first debate, presumably so the vice president could leave his lectern and prowl the stage, as he sometimes did in debates in the primaries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Officials involved in the discussions said backers of Mr. Bush had asked that the height of his lectern be lowered, apparently because he is slightly shorter than Mr. Gore and did not want to appear diminished in his presence. But both lecterns will stand 48 inches high.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's representatives prevailed, however, in altering the format so that there will be more time than in the past for give and take on a single topic.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Beyond the polls showing a see-saw contest in which Mr. Gore seems slightly up one day and Mr. Bush the next, another reason both camps are so focused on the debates might be that they are well aware that the impact of television seems particularly strong in this election.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many Democrats and Republicans credit Mr. Gore's speech at the Democratic convention -- even the kiss he gave his wife, Tipper -- as propelling Mr. Gore in the polls.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet for all those millions, officials in both campaigns say Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore will focus their messages on the narrow swath of swing voters who are expected to decide the election.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For the Bush campaign, officials said, the goal is to demonstrate to those wavering voters that the Texas governor has a command of the issues and a presidential bearing. They also intend to assure women and undecided voters that he is no uncompromising conservative.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Rove said the best way for the governor to reassure the public is ''to let the American people know what his agenda is, what he would do as president, what his philosophy is and to contrast it with Gore whenever possible.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The pressure is particularly intense for Mr. Bush because he needs to address lingering concerns that he lacks the capacity to be president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For the Gore campaign, the aim is to underscore Mr. Gore's grasp of the issues by offering many specifics, as he did in his speech at the Democratic convention. His aides said he was aiming his appeals at working-class families by presenting himself as someone who will fight for them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore is a far more accomplished debater than Mr. Bush, having dispatched politicians ranging from Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries this year to Jack Kemp in the vice-presidential debates in 1996 to Ross Perot before that. That does not mean it will be a lopsided matchup. Mr. Bush is less versed in the issues, but his advisers said his personality might shine through -- and his affable, everyday-guy appeal might score points with voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also benefits from low expectations. If he makes it through Tuesday night without a discernible gaffe or tangled syntax, the pundits -- and more importantly, the voters -- could pronounce him the victor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And the Bush campaign was trying mightily to keep the expectations high for the vice president. ''He is one of the most practiced debaters in American politics,'' said Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director. ''He's debated 30 or 40 times over the last 12 years.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But for the candidates at least, the pressure will be intense. Walter F. Mondale, Gerald R. Ford, Michael S. Dukakis and former President George Bush have all told interviewers that their stumbles in debates -- or the nimbleness of their opponent -- might have cost them the White House.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The debates have been elevated to high drama in this country and particularly in this election year,'' said former Representative Bill Paxon, an adviser to Mr. Bush. ''This election is just about as close as you can have it.''

  ''Should I be elected, I will lead our nation toward a culture that values life -- the life of the elderly and the sick, the life of the young and the life of the unborn,'' Mr. Bush said in videotaped remarks that were played tonight at the Christian Coalition's conference in Washington. Mr. Bush was at his ranch near Waco.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I know good people disagree on this issue, but surely we can agree on ways to value life by promoting adoption and parental notification,'' Mr. Bush continued. ''And when Congress sends me a bill against partial-birth abortion, I will sign it into law.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was the same tempered language that Mr. Bush typically uses to discuss abortion, which he opposes except in cases of rape, incest or risk to a pregnant woman's life. He has said that he would support a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion if it included those exceptions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the fact that he did not ratchet up his oratory for an audience that surely would have appreciated it seemed to reflect the delicacy of his dance with religious conservatives. They are an important part of his  base, but to win the presidency, Mr. Bush must appeal to moderate Republicans and independents, many of whom support abortion rights.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although his father, President George Bush, addressed the group in 1992 and Bob Dole did so in 1996, the Bush campaign had said earlier that Mr. Bush had no plans to speak to the conference. Aides said he would be busy with debate preparations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But after some Christian conservatives criticized that decision and warned that Mr. Bush should not take religious conservatives for granted, the campaign announced that Mr. Bush would videotape remarks to be played to the group.
 </textdata>

  The bureau's investigation concerns an Express Mail package received on Sept. 13 by a former congressman, Thomas Downey, who was helping Mr. Gore prepare for the presidential debates. It contained a videotape of one of Gov. George W. Bush's debate practice sessions and a thick briefing book.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And ever since, the matter has been the subject of considerable intrigue and suspicion, involving charges and countercharges. Several  Bush advisers said the materials may have been stolen from the Austin offices of Maverick Media, which they said were not as secure as their campaign headquarters and which were next to a film editing facility used by Republicans and Democrats.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000

 <textdata>
  They also sought to focus attention on the Gore campaign's suspension last week of a low-level employee who had bragged to a friend about having a mole in the Bush camp. Gore aides said that the employee had been kidding.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000

  Democrats in Texas, meanwhile, speculated that the sending of the materials was a dirty trick by the Bush campaign to embarrass the Gore campaign. Several Bush advisers said today that they did not understand the logic of that.

  According to law enforcement officials and several of Mr. Bush's aides, F.B.I. investigators have visited Maverick Media several times and talked to almost all of the employees and volunteers there, some of whom, like Mr. McKinnon, have worked for Democrats in the past.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000

  Several Bush advisers said today that Mr. McKinnon, like Ms. Lozano, had been fingerprinted, but that no one else had. Mr. McKinnon said that both he and Ms. Lozano had offered to take polygraph tests, but that the F.B.I. had not taken them up on it.

  ''The average working person in this country represents the person who I'm really fighting for in this election,'' Mr. Gore said. ''You know, I see a debate kind of like a job interview.

 </textdata>

  One of those greeting him was Donald Jalbert, 43, a school principal from Lewiston, Me. Mr. Jalbert said that the Gore campaign had provided him with an inch-thick packet of issues papers to study.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But, he said, he thought Mr. Gore was looking for ''something a little different.'' He said Mr. Gore ''has to try to attract the swing voters, and needs to figure out how to say some of these things they've been talking about a little differently.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000

  For his part, Mr. Gore told reporters on Air Force Two, ''When I get to places in the preparation where I have a question about how to proceed, I want to use them as a sounding board.''

  Mr. Gore will also be spending time with his professional campaign consultants, including Carter Eskew, Bob Shrum, Stanley Greenberg, Tad Devine and William M. Daley, his campaign chairman. Florida is also a staging ground with a purpose -- the presidential race is dead even here and if Mr. Gore can win it, his advisers believe he can win the election.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Cheney says his wife is one of his closest advisers. Even before he was tapped to run for vice president, Mrs. Cheney, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, gave advice to Gov. George W. Bush on education policy in Texas and for his presidential campaign. It is an issue she has strong feelings about. In her book ''Telling the Truth'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995), she laments that political correctness and relativism have corrupted the nation's culture and educational institutions.
 </textdata>

  All this has given Mrs. Cheney an unusually high profile for a would-be second lady. This month, she testified before Congress, taking the entertainment industry to task after a Federal Trade Commission report found that the industry regularly marketed adult-rated materials to children and teenagers. The following Sunday, she appeared on three morning talk shows -- hardly usual for the wife of a vice-presidential candidate -- talking more about the entertainment industry and criticizing Mr. Gore for attending a fund-raiser with media moguls where, she said, ''X-rated jokes'' were told. And this week, the campaign sent Mrs. Cheney on what for it has become the politically delicate task of addressing the annual convention of the Christian Coalition in Washington.

  Outside the leafy walls of universities, however, the degree has become known as a golden passport, a credential that is nearly a requirement for joining upper management. The current chief executives of General Motors, Goldman Sachs, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Merck and Nike, for instance, all hold the passport -- as does, for the first time this year, a major-party nominee for president, George W. Bush. The M.B.A., its many supporters say, gives people a business grounding that they would otherwise need years to learn.

  Nothing is more notable in modern American campaign oratory than its careful, gray, timid quality. Can anyone imagine any candidate now essaying such a robustly masculine paragraph as the one quoted above? George W. Bush is not about to invoke ''the fate of many nations,'' for fear that he may be asked to name some of them. One doubts that Al Gore would risk using the word ''cripple,'' even as a verb. (Some time back, his boss, careless of the dictionary, actually apologized to Welsh-Americans for saying that Congress was ''welching'' on its responsibilities.)

  Neither Vice President Gore nor Governor Bush seem able, in their carefully scripted utterances, to say anything that has the slightest ping of personality. Even as ''just folks,'' both men stiffen up. Their joviality, in armchair schmoozes with Jay Leno or Oprah Winfrey, is that of a pair of Toby jugs. That onstage kiss at the Democratic Convention persuaded a lot of people that Honest Al has a blood temperature of more than an ecologically correct 68 degrees Fahrenheit. But for this viewer, it looked as engineered as the torch-lighting ceremony in Sydney.

  Yet what to do with that opportunity will likely dominate Tuesday night's arguments, when Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore face off. Mr. Bush has not backed off a tax cut plan that has made some in his party so queasy that they have come up with their own, more modest proposals. And Mr. Gore has learned that even if paying down the national debt is, as one of his advisers puts it, ''an eat-your-broccoli message,'' it seems to be registering in the polls.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's plan would also pay off the debt, only in 2016. But he doesn't talk about it much, preferring instead to dwell on tax cuts that seem drawn from the playbook of Ronald Reagan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Meanwhile, as Mr. Gore continues to portray himself as the man who will lift the debt off  the shoulders of the nation's children, Mr. Bush  has to make the case that under his plan Americans can have their big tax cuts and eat their  debt, too.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's advisers, not surprisingly, look at the numbers differently, arguing that Mr. Gore's surplus is a phantom that will disappear after Election Day. Mr. Gore, meanwhile, is betting on the analogy he believes Americans will make between debt reduction and the way they would like to manage their own household budgets. ''No one can relate to a $2 trillion budget,'' Mr. Bixby said. ''But they can understand that when you have a big expense coming up -- kids going to college, or retirement -- it makes sense to get rid of your debts.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Virtuous as paying down the debt may be, it is not necessarily the best use of the government's money. Mr. Bush's tax cuts could, arguably, put more money in the stock market, where it would be available to old and new companies for research and new technologies. (If those cuts come too soon, though, they could also overstimulate an economy and a stock market that many fear is still flying too high, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates even more.) Or maybe the return on investment would be better if the money was spent on education. After all, a well-trained software engineer -- or 10 million of them -- can foster a lot of growth.

  Those restraints are lifted when an officer retires. But even so, the recent announcement that a group of military veterans -- including senior officers who until recently served under President Clinton -- had endorsed Gov. George W. Bush is raising concerns inside and outside the Pentagon about  the growing politicization of the ranks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That has not stopped politicians of both parties from embracing those in uniform and tailoring messages to appeal to them and to veterans, a far more sizable voting group. They often take their campaigns to organizations that support the military, like the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, solicit veterans' endorsements, and use veterans to bolster their own stature. Gen. Colin L. Powell, who retired after serving as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1989 to 1993, is a fixture of Mr. Bush's presidential campaign (though, like Eisenhower, he was also once courted by the Democrats). In 1992, President Clinton eagerly accepted the support of Adm. William J. Crowe, another former chairman, at a time when his campaign was dogged by questions over the steps he took to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War.

  To many current and retired officers, the recent endorsement by Veterans for Bush-Cheney -- a group organized by Gen. Charles C. Krulak, who retired as commandant of the Marine Corps last year --  seemed to cross the apolitical line. The retirees were acting collectively, they noted,  and some had retired only weeks before, including Adm. Jay L. Johnson, the former chief of naval operations, and Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the marine who served as commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf until August. Such officers, retired or not, they say, embody the institutions they served.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For those reasons, they said, the endorsements gave the impression -- one certainly welcomed by the Bush campaign -- that it was the military itself, not simply a handful of veterans, that supported Mr. Bush's candidacy.

  ''I really believe it is a disservice if senior military officers, even if retired, get drawn into the political process,'' said Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs (who has, however, advised the Gore campaign). ''It is unhealthy for the military, which works best, I think, when we do not become openly politicized.''

  GENERAL CLARK, now an investment banker in New York, said he had been courted for an endorsement, though he refused to say whether the overture had come from the Bush camp or Vice President Al  Gore's campaign, or both. He said he had declined.

  General Krulak and others who signed on to the Bush campaign have strongly defended their right to endorse the Texas governor, a point that is not contested by their critics, who simply warn that so many four-star officers backing a candidate, openly and in concert, undermined the military's carefully cultivated apoliticism.

  Overall, the two sides have fought more or less to a stalemate, which is one reason for the relatively low visibility of the abortion issue in this year's presidential campaign. George W. Bush has a lock on most anti-abortion voters, and Al Gore on most fervently abortion-rights ones, and so far neither candidate has appeared especially eager to advertise his stance to an electorate where most undecided voters may view abortion from the murky middle.

  ''The key to debate is to play to your strengths and not change who you are,'' said Jordan Factor, a 2000 graduate of Brandeis University who won the national championship of the American Parliamentary Debate Association. ''Bush should come across being a nice guy and the kind of guy you'd want to sit around and have a beer with. He should tell jokes and stories about his life in Midland.

  Mary Ellen Doran-Quine, a speech pathologist in Reston, Va., said Mr. Bush should not be too jumpy in responding. ''Sometimes he doesn't think before he talks,'' she said. ''If he pauses just a millisecond or two, he probably could prevent some of that. Bush could also open up his mouth a little bit more to get more resonance. He has a pinched nasal quality to his voice.''
 </textdata>

  By contrast, she said, Mr. Gore ''has a very nice voice quality -- voice is the element of seduction.''

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has his own issues. Ms. Doran-Quine said the vice president is so steeped in policy that he would be better off not to cram. ''I would never memorize anything if I were him,'' she said. ''It sounds like it's rehearsed.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Another concern for Mr. Gore is that he must control his inclination to verge on condescension. Mr. Burnett, the Survivor producer, said he learned this from his program: ''Don't overexplain things. You don't need to talk on a child's level.''

  Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor who moderated a presidential debate in the primaries, said Mr. Gore could have saved himself from negative media coverage if he had backtracked on his statement that he would favor a litmus test for military leaders to ensure they would allow gays in the military. ''He could have said, 'Peter, I want to reconsider my answer about that question of gays in the military,' '' Mr. Jennings said. ''That would have stopped everyone dead. When I get in trouble on television, I try to share with viewers why we make a mistake.''

  The elusive aura of electoral inevitability once possessed by Gov. George W. Bush, and then captured for a time by Vice President Al Gore, has vanished from the presidential race. The latest polls show Mr. Bush ahead, Mr. Gore ahead or a tie. The only things that seem inevitable now are that the Election Day result will be close -- perhaps as narrow as the Kennedy-Nixon race of 1960 and the Ford-Carter race of 1976 -- and the series of presidential debates that begins Tuesday will be pivotal. The swing voters are entering their decision phase.

  These are lessons that Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are no doubt studying hard this weekend as they prepare. On most issues, especially tax cuts, Social Security, Medicare and campaign finance reform, Mr. Gore continues to have positions with broader public support. The spurt in oil prices has exposed sharp differences between the candidates over Mr. Bush's proposal to open up wilderness areas to drilling and Mr. Gore's proposal to tap the strategic petroleum reserve. Here, too, the vice president would appear to benefit from the public's preference for environmental protection and lower fuel prices. The Food and Drug Administration's approval last week of an abortion-inducing pill is bound to come up in the debates, allowing Mr. Gore to solidify his lead among women by stressing his pro-choice position.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  For all that, Mr. Bush has recovered from the dive he took after the Democratic convention, and he is coming off a better couple of weeks than Mr. Gore. As was the case early in the campaign, Mr. Bush's personality seems to be offsetting his narrower issues base and Mr. Gore's advantage in expertise. A few weeks ago Mr. Bush said he would be focusing on issues more than character, but he seems to have picked up in the polls because of his genial style on television with the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Regis Philbin and Larry King. Part of his challenge is to bring that level of comfort into the auditorium in Boston on Tuesday.

  In the end, a mysterious mixture of issues, personalities and performance will flow into the public perception of who won the debates. In terms of performance, each side has its risk factors and its own version of the expectations game. The Gore team worries that Mr. Bush will get excessive credit for a merely competent performance. The Bush team hopes that Mr. Gore's strong debating skills will come across as more slashing and off-putting than masterly.

  With the presidential race as tight as the 400-meter Olympic hurdles, neither side seems to be bypassing any chance to send a message to voters in the swing states. Or as William M.

  If the point of good historical writing is to help us imagine a past that might have been, then it is hard to beat Gore Vidal. His ambitious series of historical novels, a meditation on the meaning of America in seven novelistic parts, is essentially about an America in a parallel historical universe. In the latest, final production, ''The Golden Age,'' we follow the lives of the fictional Sanford family -- wealthy, well-connected men and women in the political, literary and entertainment worlds -- into the middle of the 20th century and eavesdrop by the miracle of historical fiction on the conversations that mattered and several that didn't. If you are at all amused by the possibility of hearing Leonard Bernstein's unrecorded asides or Harry Truman's offhand harrumphs, then much of the book is irresistibly diverting, if quite unreliable.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This is where Vidal's idiosyncrasies ultimately wear thin. It is difficult to be seen as a tribune of the plebs when you never leave the social milieu of French chateaus, Georgetown mansions and New York theater openings. It is difficult to make a solid argument about America's imperial temptation when you willfully discount the darkening world that greeted the fledgling superpower in the 1930's and 40's. It is difficult to make an argument about American history when you write a novelistic account that makes grand claims about the American past, but then neither defends them by accountable historical methods nor disowns them as mere fiction. Vidal wants it every which way. In fact, he wants to be Shakespeare (Vidal draws the analogy himself). ''Why do you keep letting Shakespeare leak in upon us?'' Peter asks late in the novel. ''Why not?'' is the answer. ''He gives names to things, real and unreal. He understands how the actors -- the Roosevelts and the Trumans -- are simply spirits and once their scenes are acted out, they melt into air, into thin air, as we shall presently do, still hankering after what was not meant to be, ever.'' But Roosevelt and Truman didn't melt into thin air. They were not invented; and they didn't live long enough ago to be turned into enduring myths. They lived lives and made choices that deserve fearless scrutiny, not snooty, cynical attack. And, by any reckoning, they helped make the world what it now is -- a far freer, brighter place than anything concocted on the strange, orbiting planet called Gore Vidal.

  Since 1972, Gore Vidal has split his time between Ravello, in Italy, and a house in the Hollywood Hills -- which means, he likes to say, that arguably he no longer lives in the United States. He was here for the conventions, however, and returned last month for the revival of his play ''The Best Man'' at the Virginia Theater. The following conversation took place, by phone, when he was briefly back in Italy.

  I really, truly wasn't planning to write any more columns about George W. Bush's arithmetic. But his performance on ''Moneyline'' last Wednesday was just mind-blowing. I had to download a transcript to convince myself that I had really heard him correctly. It was as if Mr. Bush's aides had prepared him with a memo saying: ''You've said some things on the stump that weren't true. Your mission, in the few minutes you have, is to repeat all of those things. Don't speak in generalities -- give specific false numbers. That'll show them!''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  First, Mr. Bush talked about the budget -- ''There's about $4.6 trillion of surplus projected,'' he declared, which is true, even if the projections are dubious. He then went on to say: ''I want some of the money, nearly a trillion, to go to projects like prescription drugs for seniors. Money to strengthen the military to keep the peace. I've got some views about education around the world. I want to -- you know, I've got some money in there for the environment.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush presumably wants to convey the sense that he's a compassionate guy who really cares about education, the environment and all that. But that doesn't excuse claiming to spend twice as much on these good things as the number given in his own budget.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He continued: ''But there's still a quarter unspent, about $1.3 trillion [the size of Mr. Bush's tax cut]. I think we ought to send it back to the people who pay the bills.'' Alas, 4 times 1.3 is 5.2, not 4.6 -- and anyway, the full budget cost of that tax cut, including interest, is $1.6 trillion, more than a third of the projected surplus.

  Next came Social Security. Here a bit of explanation is needed. The reason Social Security is in trouble is that the system has a large ''hole'' -- basically a hidden debt -- because previous generations of retirees were paid benefits out of the contributions of younger workers. That hole also means that you can't justify privatizing Social Security -- which Mr. Bush advocates -- by comparing the rate of return that an individual could get by investing in government bonds and the implied rate of return on his Social Security contributions. That comparison ignores a multitrillion-dollar debt that somebody has to pay.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, wasting no time, went straight to that bogus comparison. ''But the safest of all safe -- of about 4 percent [a reference to government bonds] -- is twice what they get in the Social Security trust today.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Is there any way to explain away Mr. Bush's remarks -- three major self-serving misstatements in the course of only a couple of minutes? Not that I can see. We're not talking questionable economic analysis here, just facts: what Mr. Bush said to that national television audience simply wasn't true.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What is really striking here is the silence of the media -- those ''liberal media'' conservatives complain about. ''Moneyline'' would never let a C.E.O. get away with claiming to spend twice as much on research as the sum announced in the company's own press release. But when Mr. Bush declared that he would spend twice as much on new programs as the sum announced by his own campaign, the interviewer said nothing -- and nobody else picked up on it.

  As I said, I don't want to keep writing about this. But reporters seem to be too busy chasing rats and dogs to look at what the candidates say about their actual policy proposals. So someone has to point out that in an interview intended to showcase his economic program, Mr. Bush did it again: he vastly exaggerated  his spending plans, greatly understated the cost of his tax cut and misrepresented the issues on Social Security.

  In a Sept. 27 editorial, Gov. George W. Bush's casual remark that he admired Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas elicits a list of their most extreme dictums. It is implicit that if Mr. Bush is elected, the dictums would become law. Vice President Al Gore designated Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall as favorites, but this leads your editorial to predict that he would appoint more moderate justices.

  Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush also named Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and David Souter, who support the present rule on women's right to choose abortion. The Rehnquist court has disciplined the excesses of the court when it was dominated by Justices Brennan and Marshall, while maintaining strong protections for free speech and taking a balanced approach on criminal law. A Gore victory threatens that balance.

  Mr. Rogers has called Gov. George W. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut too big, and said he favored voluntary private investment of some Social Security taxes only if benefits, tax levels and retirement ages would not have to be altered.

  Each candidate has national issues to argue. On Wednesday, in the closest thing to a slap at Mr. Rogers, Ms. Byrum said: ''My opponent and George Bush believe we should have a large across-the-board tax cut. If you do that, you do not have any money to put into targeted tax cuts, to put into Social Security, to put into strengthening Medicare.''

  It is very difficult for the average Medicare beneficiary to sit down with the Bush and Gore plans and compare how much she would pay in premiums and co-payments and how much she would receive in benefits. That is because the approaches of the two candidates are so different, and there are so many unknowns about Gov. George W. Bush's plan.
 </textdata>

  Given what is known, many analysts and consumer advocates consider Vice President Al Gore's plan to be more generous; he would devote much more money to it, they note, and he promises a higher federal subsidy for premiums. Mr. Bush's health care advisers counter that his plan offers more flexibility and more choices for older Americans.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush, who spoke little about the issue in the primaries, has increasingly focused on prescription drugs as the campaign has progressed. His enemy, though, is not the drug industry but the prospect of ''big government'' intervention that could stymie innovation and force the elderly into a ''one-size-fits-all'' government plan. Like other Republicans, Mr. Bush would rely heavily on the private health insurance industry -- H.M.O.'s and other managed care companies -- to deliver drug benefits to the elderly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush takes a two-track approach. For the first four years, he would send $48 billion to the states to help low-income elderly people, including those with annual incomes up to about $14,600. This accounts for Mr. Gore's claim that the Bush plan would force the elderly into welfare offices for prescription drugs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Down the road, Mr. Bush sees drug benefits as an outgrowth of his proposal to transform Medicare, a fairly traditional government insurance program, into an arena for competing private health plans. (Only about 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are now in H.M.O.'s.) Those H.M.O.'s and other health networks, all vying for the business of Medicare beneficiaries, would be required to offer the elderly a ''high option'' plan that covers drugs. (So would the federal government, for those who choose to stay with traditional Medicare.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush promises a federal subsidy for those prescription drug premium costs of 25 percent -- more for the low-income elderly. And Mr. Bush would create a catastrophic benefit that would kick in when the elderly's out-of-pocket bills hit $6,000.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000

 <textdata>
  Still, many of the details of this plan are left up to a future White House task force, the Congress and the private marketplace: for example, how much would the basic drug benefit be worth? What would the basic package look like in the Bush plan? What would be the deductibles, the co-payments and the like?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Because of the emphasis on the private marketplace, said Ron Pollack, head of the consumer advocacy group Families USA, ''different people in the same state would have considerably different benefits and considerably different cost-sharing requirements.'' And, he added, Mr. Bush ''simply does not define what that would be.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Sally Canfield, a health adviser to the Bush campaign, said, ''We did not want to hamstring the task force on how they wanted to set up the benefit.'' Democrats and their allies suggest another rationale: the Republicans are avoiding details that can be used against them, as they are now using the size of the Gore premium against the Democrats.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Kenneth E. Thorpe, a professor of health policy at Emory University and a former top analyst in the Clinton administration, argued that the average premium under the Bush plan was bound to be substantially higher, in large part because Mr. Bush would provide a lower subsidy than Mr. Gore, and because private health plans would have higher administrative costs.
 </textdata>

  In general, the price of Mr. Bush's Medicare proposal, including the restructuring proposals and prescription drugs, is $158 billion over 10 years, according to the Bush campaign. Mr. Gore proposes spending $338 billion on prescription drugs alone, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, over that same period.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore would offer a drug benefit under the traditional Medicare program, available to older Americans for an additional monthly premium, which would start at $25 a month in 2002 and double over the next decade. It would be a voluntary benefit; people could choose it or waive it. But if they sign up, Mr. Gore says, the federal government would subsidize half the real cost of the drug premiums.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign offers the example of a widow with $610 of prescription drugs to buy each month, or $7,320 a year. It assumes she would receive a 10 percent discount (subtract $732) for being part of a drug plan. Medicare would pay half of the first $5,000 of her bills; she would pay the rest. After her bills reached $5,000, she would be responsible on her own until she reached the $4,000 cap on out-of-pocket drug costs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Advertising produced for the Republican National Committee refers to a $600 annual ''big government access fee,'' the yearly premiums for the Gore plan when it is fully implemented a decade from now. Republicans have noted that beneficiaries could pay more in premiums than they receive in benefits, although experts note that this is the case with all kinds of insurance.

  OF course, the cast had no diversity whatsoever: the core cast included too many Irishmen and Jews, no women, no Hispanics or Italians, only one African-American. So Mr. Florek got replaced by a black woman, S. Epatha Merkerson, who took on the role of Lieutenant Van Buren (she had previously appeared in a first-season episode as the mother of a perp, or a vic, or possibly both), and Mr. Dzundza got killed off to make room for Paul Sorvino. At first I thought I would resent these changes bitterly, but the show went on pretty much as before, and I came to like these two actors almost as much as their predecessors. Then Paul Sorvino gave way to Jerry Orbach -- O.K., I survived that too -- and Richard Brooks got replaced by a succession of pretty young women, each slightly more annoying than the previous one. (Actually, the current occupant of the assistant D.A. role, Angie Harmon, is vastly more annoying than either Jill Hennessy or Carey Lowell was; her voice is like fingernails on a blackboard, and her face registers only a single expression.) When Michael Moriarty got ousted by Sam Waterston, the show's condition was clearly terminal, but I held on for the sake of Chris Noth. It was only when Noth left -- later to reappear in the weirdest places, like HBO's ''Sex and the City'' and the Broadway revival ''Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man' '' -- that I knew my ''Law and Order'' no longer existed.

  Tipper Gore hopped off a New Orleans streetcar and boogied her way through the crowd, shimmying all alone to the music of a Dixieland band. Wacky, fun-loving Tipper was at it again. Just as in Los Angeles, where she had jammed on stage at the Democratic convention. Which was nothing compared with her performance four years ago in Chicago. That time, she jumped into Lake Michigan with her clothes on. Officially, she's the antidote to her stuffy husband, Lucy to his Ricky Ricardo, forever mugging and angling to play with the band. What will she think of next? Today, it's a one-woman line dance outside the local party headquarters, where she's supposed to cut a ribbon and give a speech. But there is something a little off, a little forced about the gaiety swirling around the laughing woman who is dancing as fast as she can while a small herd of TV camera guys closes in. It doesn't look like fun.

  The woman does have a raucous side and an authentic subversive streak. In fact, after an often unfun childhood, she has been fairly determined in that way. She regularly skips functions that sound boring and once greeted a female acquaintance at a very fancy Washington party with an undecorous pinch on the bottom. Yet she is also darker, smarter, tougher, more difficult and more complicated than the goofy cardboard cutout she likes to hide behind. She is not just unpredictable -- the first word her oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, chooses to describe her -- but erratic: expansive one day and down the next. A friend who has worked closely with her on mental health issues says, ''She struggles with her mood, but she doesn't want to be pitied'' just because it is public knowledge that she became clinically depressed after her son was hit by a car in 1989. Like her husband, she has a mostly interior nature, and like him too, she is devoted to the kind of family life neither of them had as kids. And she is even more private and press-shy than he is, especially since being worked over for her mid-80's campaign against explicit rock lyrics.When the news photographers start clicking away, she often pulls out her own camera and shoots back.

  When the music finally ends in New Orleans, Tipper Gore stops laughing and faces the small crowd hesitantly. Standing up on the porch of the old house that is being turned into a campaign headquarters, she twists the toe of one shoe into the floor as if she would like to tunnel out of there and says just a few words, in a barely audible voice: ''I'm going to cut the ribbon so we can get to work. How's that?''

  Yet this, this is the Tipper Gore that the folks here have turned out to meet. The women -- and it is women, mostly -- who surround her at the little cake-and-tea reception that follows have either seen past all the light and motion or read it in a slightly different way. One of them remarks to a friend that there is no one else she would have waited two hours for, standing out in the hot sun.

  When I sit down with her in her New York hotel, Gore seems relaxed, sinking back into the couch and altogether comfortable in a loose-fitting black jacket and pants. When I ask whether she lobbies her husband on the issues, she tosses back, ''Not my thing.'' The most important issues in the race to her, she says, are the Supreme Court and health care. ''I'm not trying to cover all my bases here. I know it's supposed to be education.'' Everything important is personal with her. Health care, for example, is something she came to care about through her 76-year-old mother, Margaret Carlson Aitcheson, who has had recurring bouts of depression and lives in the Gores' pool house at the vice-presidential residence.

  ''My mother taught me about courage,'' Gore says with real pride. By which she means that her mother, who worked as an accountant, did the very best she could. There were good times -- times her mother took her to the symphony and to see ''The Seven-Year Itch'' on Broadway. ''Yet,'' Gore says, ''she also had the struggle of depression. She always wants me to say that, thank you very much, she did recover from it. I saw her rebuild time and time again. It was hard. They didn't have modern medication back then. But she didn't complain.'' And neither does her daughter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Did her mother talk to her about her illness? ''When she was able to,'' Gore says quietly. I tell her that when she talks about depression, it sounds nothing like the disease I'm pretty well acquainted with through a couple of people I love. She makes it sound so easy -- take a little something and boom, all's well. She doesn't argue, but says: ''My mission is to reach -- kind of like the presidential debates -- reach the maximum number I can and people who don't understand it at all. Particularly in the South, they believe you can pray your way out of it, or will your way out of it.''

  Backstage last month at Al Gore's glitzy Radio City Music Hall fund-raiser, just a couple of minutes before the vice president was scheduled to go on, he was still mulling what to say to the crowd. Joe Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, were holding hands and chatting with Tipper while they all waited, just beyond the curtain. But Al Gore had a laptop set up on a small table only a couple of feet out of view of the audience, and he was busy editing his remarks with his speechwriter, Eli Attie. Intent, furiously chewing gum, repeatedly mopping his forehead, Gore called his wife over and ran several bits of the speech past her. She was just as serious and very animated as she reviewed the remarks, repeatedly shaking her head no and making chopping motions with her hands. He asked, she answered, he nodded. Then the speechwriter nodded in turn. In the darkness, which was broken only by the glow of the computer and the small penlight Gore was using to read some notes, the moment felt much more intimate than the long kiss they shared in front of the crowd at the Democratic convention.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Gore speaks of his wife, what comes through most clearly is his gratitude, his feeling that she rescued him emotionally and his appreciation for the price she paid to be the wife he needed her to be. Certainly, she never wanted the political life. And though she found work she cared about -- twice, in fact -- she never took her turn. First, she studied to become a therapist. Then, just as she was discovering her talent for photojournalism, her husband announced that he was running for Congress and needed a full-time partner. She gave up on some aspects of her college feminism many years ago, she says now, and no longer believes in having it all: ''You've got to have one strong person always there for the kids.'' Still, she tries to look at it like this: Hasn't she done more to destigmatize mental illness than she could ever have done in private practice?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  She does have Al, though -- and has since they met on the night of his senior prom, when she was 16 and he was 17. In between campaign stops in Ohio a couple of weeks ago, Gore told me that ''she brings excitement to my life that wouldn't be there otherwise. She sees things I don't see, understands things I don't understand. I've learned so much from her.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But she can be awfully proper too. During the Radio City fund-raiser, when Bette Midler repeated the vulgarity that George W. Bush had used to describe the Times reporter Adam Clymer, her jaw literally dropped. And she can come off as imperious. At the end of our first interview, I said I hoped we would be talking again soon, and she said, very slowly, drawing out each word, almost as if imitating some monarch, ''Yes, I've decided you're an O.K. sort. I've decided I will speak to you again.'' When next we met -- she and Karenna had invited me to a private lunch at the residence, just the three of us -- she was quite chilly, which was odd under the circumstances. Yet when I saw her again, only a few days later, she could not have been more effusive in her warmth.

  Karenna, the 27-year-old new lawyer, new mom and big-cheese adviser to her father, sits down for coffee in her neighborhood on Manhattan's Upper East Side and says: ''So, 'All About My Mother.' Great movie.'' The Tipper Gore she describes is ''kind of a hippie.'' But one with lots of rules. ''When I was little, we'd go on marches and boycott things all the time'' -- Nestle Quik, for example. ''Then there was the thing that I couldn't watch Mighty Mouse. To her, pictures of naked people weren't bad because that was natural, but Mighty Mouse was bad because the girl mouse was always screaming to be rescued. Mighty Mouse was this charged figure for me. The ultimate for me was to watch Mighty Mouse while drinking Nestle Quik and eating Wonder bread -- she was big on whole wheat too.''

  WHEN the Hartford Symphony takes the stage at the Bushnell this season, the programs may very well produce more than music. One of the eight guest conductors of the subscription programs will likely become the symphony's new music director. Edward Cumming was at the podium last weekend, while Andre Raphel Smith, the assistant conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, arrives Oct. 17 and 18. Other conductors in the series include James Paul, Steven Smith, Leslie Dunner, Derrick Inouye, Enrique Arturo Diemecke and Ransom Wilson. Perhaps, however, the music director will be chosen from conductors coming into town for other parts of the symphony's season: Martin Fischer-Dieskau, in charge of two pops evenings; Peter Sacco and Randall Craig Fleischer, presiding over family matinees; Angel Gil-Ordonez and Joseph Silverstein, leading concerts by the Hartford Symphony Chamber Orchestra. The number to call for a list of programs and guest soloists is (860) 244-2999.

  RICHARD W. STEVENSON  In Tuesday's debate, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore threw at each other -- and viewers -- a barrage of claims and counterclaims, facts and figures and jargon.

  The total budget surplus over the next 10 years is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be $4.56 trillion. Mr. Bush, like Mr. Gore and the two parties in Congress, has agreed that the portion of the surplus generated by Social Security -- $2.38 trillion, or 52 percent of the total -- should go only to reducing the national debt or shoring up the retirement system.

  Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut amounts to $1.32 trillion, or 29 percent of the surplus. It is also fair to say that Mr. Bush's tax cut uses up $1.6 trillion of the surplus. That is because the surplus is calculated on the assumption that all of it will go to reducing the national debt, lowering the government's interest costs. If $1.32 trillion of the surplus goes to a tax cut, the interest bill will rise by around $300 billion. If the tax cut is valued at $1.6 trillion, that would be 35 percent of the surplus.

  In saying he would devote one quarter of the surplus to ''important projects,'' Mr. Bush was referring to his plans for additional spending on health, education, agriculture, the military and other needs. He values his spending package at $475 billion over 10 years, which would be 10 percent of the surplus. If interest costs of $100 billion are added to the spending proposal, it would be 13 percent of the surplus.

  People earning $200,000 or more would pay 40.9 percent of all income taxes under the Bush plan, compared to 39.1 percent under current law.

  Mr. Gore's assertion is based on an analysis by a liberal-leaning tax research group, Citizens for Tax Justice.

  Citizens for Tax Justice found that 42.6 percent of the benefits of the Bush tax cut, including the estate tax repeal, would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers by income -- those making $319,000 or more. If that percentage were applied to the $1.3 trillion price tag that Mr. Bush puts on his tax plan, it implies that $554 billion would go to the wealthiest 1 percent. Mr. Bush's budget proposal calls for $475 billion in additional spending over the next 10 years on the areas cited by Mr. Gore, and others.

  If the estate tax is taken out of the calculation, 30 percent of Mr. Bush's tax cut would go to the wealthiest 1 percent, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. Without the estate tax repeal, Mr. Bush values his tax cut at $1.06 trillion, and 30 percent of that would be $318 billion, or $157 billion less than Mr. Bush's spending plan.

  There is no disagreement when it comes to Social Security. Mr. Gore has proposed that the Medicare surplus -- $360 billion over the next 10 years -- be dedicated solely to debt reduction. The idea has considerable bipartisan support in Congress. But Mr. Bush's proposed budget relies on the Medicare surplus to pay for his tax cuts and spending plans. Using the Bush campaign's figures, Mr. Bush's budget would go $95 billion into the red over 10 years if the Medicare surplus were put off limits.

  RICHARD W. STEVENSON  In Tuesday's debate, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore threw at each other -- and viewers -- a barrage of claims and counterclaims, facts and figures and jargon.

  The total budget surplus over the next 10 years is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be $4.56 trillion. Mr. Bush, like Mr. Gore and the two parties in Congress, has agreed that the portion of the surplus generated by Social Security -- $2.38 trillion, or 52 percent of the total -- should go only to reducing the national debt or shoring up the retirement system.

  Mr. Lieberman countered that the Republican proposal for a large across-the-board reduction in income tax rates, combined with various spending programs and the cost of Mr. Bush's plan to privatize part of the Social Security system, would leave the budget with a $1.1 trillion debt. [Excerpts, Page A28.]

  Mr. Lieberman, politely, disagreed. ''I have not changed a single position since Al Gore nominated me to be his vice president,'' he said.

  Mr. Cheney, meanwhile, echoed Mr. Bush's contention that Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman would abandon the centrist Democratic policies of the Clinton years and would rely on big government solutions to the country's problems. He also repeated Mr. Bush's assertion that the Democrats had failed to lead during their eight years in the White House.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Cheney also echoed Mr. Bush's contention that Mr. Gore's tax cut plan, which would provide relief for those putting money into savings accounts, college tuition, child care and other specific purposes, would serve as a form of social engineering.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000

  Mr. Lieberman responded that the American military was ''the best-trained, best-equipped, most powerful force in the world and that Al Gore and I will do whatever it takes to keep them that way.''

  As a committed centrist, a moral critic of President Clinton and the first Jew nominated by a major party, Mr. Lieberman is widely considered to have boosted the appeal of the Democratic ticket. His primary vulnerabilities so far have been his historical differences with Mr. Gore on several issues, including affirmative action and school vouchers. Again, except when prompted by Mr. Shaw, Mr. Cheney chose not to exploit those differences.

  As bar codes proliferated, most consumers came to take them for granted, but the mysterious stripes never totally lost their power to confound and provoke. In 1992, President George Bush inadvertently bolstered his reputation for being out of touch with regular Americans when on a trip to a National Grocers Association conference he expressed amazement at a grocery scanner. And until recently, the Russian Orthodox Church condemned bar codes, seeing in their stripes ''the mark of the beast.''

  In an encounter characterized by polite, almost amiable disagreements, Senator Joseph Lieberman and former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney defended the men at the top of their tickets, while carefully avoiding the personal attacks of the presidential debate earlier this week. In substance, the candidates echoed the disagreements of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, but with a muted tone that seemed aimed at reassuring the public about their respective commitments to civility. Mr. Lieberman sounded almost sorrowful in criticizing the Republican tax cut proposal, while Mr. Cheney hammered calmly at the vice president's alleged love of big government. Although almost refreshingly low key, the debate seemed unlikely to have an immediate impact on the polls.

  Mr. Cheney's goal last night was to do no harm to Mr. Bush's candidacy and to reinforce, in somber tones, the Republican attack on Mr. Gore's approach to government. In recent weeks the former defense secretary has seized on the vice president's habit of stretching the record, but last night he dwelled mainly on Mr. Gore's links to the ''old ways of governing'' in Washington. On abortion rights, he seemed to go out of his way to say that although he and Mr. Bush were pro-life, they would work on incremental steps to reduce abortions. Mr. Lieberman countered that the Republican ticket simply did not believe in a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion, and that he and Mr. Gore did.

  One of the sharpest exchanges of the evening involved military readiness and defense spending. Mr. Cheney accused the Clinton administration of producing a military that is ''overcommitted but under-resourced.'' Mr. Lieberman fired back that such charges undermined morale for the purposes of partisan advantage, adding that Mr. Gore's budget allotted more money for new weapons than Mr. Bush's did.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Despite such fencing, the most striking aspects of the debate were its friendly atmosphere and yet its delineation of two sharply divergent philosophies of government. The candidates referred to each other as ''Joe'' and ''Dick,'' a reminder that they are both seasoned professionals and veterans of many political wars in Washington. One of their few vivacious exchanges was both barbed and friendly, when Mr. Cheney charged that the Clinton administration had been one of ''talk and no action.'' With a mischievous smile, Mr. Lieberman commented dryly that Mr. Gore and President Clinton had made promises and delivered on them ''big time, if I may put it that way'' -- a jab at Mr. Cheney's overheard comment after a verbal indiscretion by Mr. Bush.

  Despite the traditional ''hatchet man'' role of vice-presidential candidates, these two sounded more like moot-court lawyers arguing their briefs. For this reason, it was a debate in which anyone keeping a scorecard would have a hard time finding a winner or a loser. It was almost a textbook example of reasoned exchange, rather than a contest of killer lines, competing egos and replayable stumbles. At the end of the evening, both the contestants and the commentators seemed impressed by the civics lesson that had been broadcast on national television. But the election is certain to be decided less on what the running mates say than on how the voters view Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush as leaders and whether, by Nov. 7, the electorate sees the Republicans' sweeping tax cut proposal as sound policy or a giveaway for the wealthy.

  Conversations with a random assortment of two dozen voters in the St. Louis suburbs this week -- mothers taking their children to soccer practice, retirees at their afternoon bowling games, a chemist shopping at the local grocery chain, Schnuck's -- showed that the presidential debate did have some effect on those undecided voters interviewed. Specifically, undecided women said they were now leaning toward Mr. Gore, while undecided men said they were leaning toward Mr. Bush.

  Undecided women, whether Republican, Democratic or independent, said Mr. Gore seemed strong, presidential and, as one woman put it, less ''wishy-washy'' than expected. But undecided men, even some who support Mr. Gore, were put off by him. Robert Fishbone, a 49-year-old painter and musician who plans to vote for Mr. Gore, called him ''Mr. Technical.''

 <textdata>
  ''What he has to do is quit telling me all these minute details,'' said Mr. Vinjamoori, 52, an independent who voted twice for Ronald Reagan and twice for President Clinton and who is now leaning toward Mr. Bush. ''He has to tell me how he would lead the country, without lecturing me. And he sounds like he has preprogrammed answers. He doesn't speak from his heart.''

  A case in point is Jacqueline Taylor, a 43-year-old nurse and registered Democrat who lives with her husband, a doctor, and four children in Ladue. Ms. Taylor said she had started watching the debate with little enthusiasm for Mr. Gore, whom she thought of as ''such a wishy-washy person'' and ''a nerd.'' In fact, she said, ''I kind of in my heart wanted Bush to say something to change my mind, to swing me over.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush did not. In Ms. Taylor's view, he made a big mistake when he said that the Russians should intervene in the Balkans and help persuade Slobodan Milosevic to step down.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Let the Russians handle it,'' Ms. Taylor said, paraphrasing Mr. Bush with disgust. ''We're supposed to be the world leader.'' His answer, she said, was ''wimpy.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000

  Mr. Bush, she said, should have been better prepared. And Mr. Gore, to her surprise, seemed commanding and forceful.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Vicki Simon, a 55-year-old independent who often votes for Democrats, had a similar reaction. She was leaning with no excitement toward Mr. Gore and was willing to consider Mr. Bush. Ms. Simon said she had been particularly interested in the debate because she had spent the last two years as a lay missionary in Nairobi, Kenya, cut off from American politics and television. She was home for a visit with her son and will vote by absentee ballot.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's performance, she said, made up her mind -- against him. She said he seemed ''on the defensive'' and not intellectually matched against Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore surprised her, too: ''He wasn't as boring as I remember him,'' she said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Simon's 28-year-old son, Mark, of University City, saw it differently. He, too, is an independent, and he, too, was undecided before the debate. Now he still is, but he is more comfortable with Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Simon was also struck by what he described as Mr. Bush's endearing genuineness. ''I don't see him as clever enough or sophisticated enough to get away with lying,'' Mr. Simon said. ''He comes across as this simple guy who just says what he thinks. With Gore, I want to believe him, but I'm not sure I can trust all the acting stuff.''

  Gary Hollingsworth, 56, a coffee salesman and an independent who was picking up his two children at the Old Bonhomme School in Olivette, said that he also distrusted Mr. Gore. He was leaning toward Mr. Bush before the debate, he said, and still is, particularly after he heard on the radio that Mr. Gore had embellished anecdotes he told during the debate about a crowded school classroom in Florida and a trip he took to inspect fires and floods in Texas.

  The crisis in Yugoslavia rescued Mr. Gore from the sloughs of post-debate despond. Yesterday voters had to be recalling that he was the candidate who knew Vojislav Kostunica's name, while Mr. Bush is the one who appears to celebrate every new foreign policy discussion by inventing a different way to pronounce ''Milosevic.''

 <textdata>
  Those lapses into semi-fiction have come to assume an enormous import in this race. Mr. Gore comes up with an imaginary story about a good-will trip to Texas, and somehow it balances out the fact that Mr. Bush has an imaginary trillion dollars in his Social Security plan. The polls say Americans agree with Mr. Gore's positions on most issues. But they appear to be wrestling with the question of whether they can bear to have him around all the time for four long years. That's why we've suddenly elevated those funny noises he made during the debate to a matter of national significance.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000

 <textdata>
  This is the genius -- well, let's not get carried away, this is the clever thing about the Bush campaign's new war cry. ''Fuzzy math'' doesn't really refer to Mr. Gore's numbers. It's how you feel when Mr. Gore starts talking about them. Maybe the answer is for the vice president to promise he'll run the country but send Joe Lieberman to tell us what's happening.

  Mr. Bush seems to be planning to use the interval between presidential debates to offer up all the rejoinders he'd have fired at Mr. Gore on Tuesday if only he'd thought of them. At almost every campaign stop he re-adds his budget to prove that the vice president was wrong when he said the Bush agenda spends more money on tax cuts than everything else combined. And that tax relief for the rich? ''The wealthy folks get one-fifth of the benefits -- far short, far short of what he was talking about,'' said Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Do you actually want to know who's right? Mr. Bush counts only  one of his many tax cuts when he's figuring out how much the wealthy get, while Mr. Gore adds them all up. And Mr. Gore is comparing Mr. Bush's tax cut with the Republican plans for spending hikes. But Mr. Bush is comparing the tax cut with the entire federal budget for the other programs, which obviously makes it look smaller.

  MR. CHENEY  I think it's an extraordinarily important decision we're going to make on Nov. 7. We're really going to choose between what I consider to be an old way of governing ourselves, of high levels of spending, high taxes, an ever more intrusive bureaucracy, or a new course, a new era if you will, and Governor Bush and I want to offer that new course of action.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  We care a great deal about the issues that are at stake here, and one of the difficulties we have, frankly, is that for the last eight years we've ignored a lot of these problems. We haven't moved aggressively on Social Security. We haven't moved, for example, on Medicare. There are important issues out there that need to be resolved, and it's important for us to get on with our business. And that's what Governor Bush and I want to do.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And what we want to do, what Governor Bush and I want to do, is to change that. We think we know how to do it. Governor Bush has done it in Texas. We want to emphasize local control so that the people here in Danville, Ky., decide what's best for their kids. We want to insist on high standards. One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards, in effect to say to a youngster because of ethnic background or their income level, we don't have the same kind of expectations from you that we have for everybody else. And we want accountability. We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we're making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So we think it's extraordinarily important. This is probably the single most important issue in this campaign. Governor Bush has made it clear that when he's elected this will be his No. 1 priority as a legislative major to submit to the Congress.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000

 <textdata>
  MR. LIEBERMAN  Bernie, Al Gore and I are committed to making America's public schools the best in the world. And I disagree with what my opponent has said. A lot of progress has been made in recent years. Average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents and teachers and administrators all around America. But there's more to be done. And if you'll allow me, I want to go back to your last question because it leads to this question. I think both of us agree that, leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, there's $1.8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next 10 years. As I said before, we're being fiscally responsible about it. We're taking $300 billion off the top to put into reserve fund. The rest of it, we're going to use for middle class tax cuts and investments in programs like education.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now, there's a big difference here between these two tickets. Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively. We're saving money to invest in education. You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money. Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose: to recruit 100,000 new teachers, to reduce the size of classrooms, to help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000

 <textdata>
  MR. LIEBERMAN  Well, it's a good and an important question. Obviously in our time, fortunately, great advances have been made by women achieving the kind of equality that they were too long denied. But, Bernie, your question is absolutely right. Women, actually the number I have is: receive 72 cents for every dollar a man receives in a comparable job. But Al Gore and I have issued an economic plan in which we've stated specific goals for the future. And one of those goals is to eliminate the pay gap between men and women. It's unfair and it's unacceptable. And the first way we will do that is by supporting the equal pay act which has been proposed in Congress, which gives women the right to file legal actions against employers who are not treating them fairly and not paying them equally. Secondly, we're going to do everything we can using governmental support of business agencies such as the Small Business Administration to help women business owners have an opportunity to invest and begin businesses and make larger incomes themselves. And there are other civil rights and human rights laws that I think can come to play here.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So, bottom line, this is an unfair and unacceptable situation. And even though as the economy has risen in the last eight years, America's women have risen with it and received more income, until women are receiving the same amount of pay for the same job they're doing as a man receives, we've not achieved genuine equality in this country. And Al Gore and I are committed to closing that gap and achieving that equality.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But I also think it's not just about the differential with respect to women. If you look, for example, at our opponent's tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home. You, in effect, as a stay-at-home mom get no tax advantage under the Gore tax plan as contrasted with the Bush proposal which, in fact, provides tax relief for absolutely everybody who pays taxes. And it's important to understand that the things that we're trying to change and the things that we're trying to address in the course of the campaign and what our agenda is for the future, our plans are for the future, focus very much upon giving as much control as we can to individual Americans, be they men or women, be they single or married, as much control as possible over their own lives, especially in the area of taxation. We want to make certain that the American people have the ability to keep more of what they earn and then they get to decide how to spend it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The proposal we have from -- from Al Gore, basically, doesn't do that. It, in effect, lays out some 29 separate tax credits, and if you live your life the way they want you to live your life, if you do, in fact, behave in a certain way, then you qualify for a tax credit and at that point you get some relief. Bottom line, though, is 50 million American taxpayers out there get no advantages at all out of the Gore tax proposal, whereas under the Bush plan everybody who pays taxes will in fact get tax relief. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The first thing is that, in fact, the tax relief program that Al Gore and I have proposed, one of those many tax credits for the middle class that Dick just referred to includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms. Just as a way of saying that we understand that you are performing a service for our society, we want you to have that tax credit.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Second, the number of 50 million Americans not benefiting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong. It's an estimate done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and it's just plain wrong. And secondly, although Governor Bush says that his tax cut program, large as it is, gives a tax cut to everybody as the newspapers indicated earlier this week, the Joint Committee on Taxation, again a nonpartisan group in Congress, has said that 27 million Americans don't get what the governor said they would in their tax cut program.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Again, Al Gore and I want to live within our means. We're not going to give it all away in one big tax cut and certainly not to the top one percent of the public that doesn't need it now.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. CHENEY  Bernie, the abortion issue is a very tough one, without question, and a very important one. And, Governor Bush and I have emphasized that while we clearly are both pro-life, that's what we believe, that we want to look for ways to try to reduce the incidence of abortion in our society. Many on the pro-choice side have said exactly the same thing. Even Bill Clinton, who's been a supporter of abortion rights, has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible. With respect to the question of RU486, we believe that of course that it's recently been approved by the F.D.A. That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women. They didn't address the, sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What we'd like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion, we're thinking of such things as promoting adoption as an alternative, encouraging parental notification and we also think banning the horrific practice of partial-birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement. Congress has twice passed, by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions. Twice it's been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore and we would hope that eventually they would recognize that that's not a good position for them to be in. With respect to the RU486 proposal, at this stage, I haven't looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation. Governor Bush made it clear the other night that he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the F.D.A. to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because as I say the decision they made was on the efficacy of the drug, not the question of whether or not we supported abortion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But let me say more generally that the significant difference here on this issue is that Al Gore and I respect and will protect a woman's right to choose. And our opponents will not. We know that this is a difficult personal, moral, medical issue, but that is exactly why it ought to be left under our law to a woman, her doctor and her God. Now, one area in which we agree, Al Gore and I, is that we believe that the government ought to do everything it can to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, and therefore the number of abortions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And incidentally, here there is good news to report. The number of abortions is actually down in America over the last eight years. In fact, over the last eight years the number of teenage pregnancies has dropped 20 percent. And the reason it has is that there are good programs out there that Al Gore and I will continue to support, such as family planning and programs that encourage abstinence. But when the health of a woman is involved, I think the government has to be respectful.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  I know our opponents have said that they thought that was an overreaching. It wasn't. It was a matter of principle and America's national interest and values. And the fact is that we stopped the aggression; we stopped the genocide. And therefore strengthened our relationship with our European allies in NATO and, in fact, made the United States more respected and trusted by our allies and more feared by our enemies. I think that Vice President Gore played a critical role, passionate, purposive role, in leading the administration, along with Republican supporters like Bob Dole and John McCain, to do the right thing in the Balkans. And, hopefully, tonight we are seeing the final results of that bold and brave effort.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic's departure. Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U.S. troops. I do think it's noteworthy that there appears to be an effort under way to get the Russians involved. I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night, in the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that, that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians, and Al Gore pooh-poohed it. But now it's clear from the press that, in fact, that's exactly what they were doing and that Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000

 <textdata>
  MR. SHAW  Your question, Mr. Secretary. You and Governor Bush charge that the Clinton-Gore administration have presided over the deterioration and overextension of America's armed forces. Should U.S. military personnel be deployed as warriors or peacekeepers?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He's concerned that if he ever had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost. That is a legitimate concern, and this is a very important area and the fact the U.S. military is worse off today than it was eight years ago, a major responsibility for us in the future and a high priority for myself and Governor Bush will be to rebuild the U.S. military to give them the resources they need to do the job we ask them to do for us and to give them good leadership.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LIEBERMAN  Well, I am, Bernie. And, most important, I want to assure the American people that the American military is the best-trained, best-equipped, most powerful force in the world and that Al Gore and I will do whatever it takes to keep them that way. It's not right, and it's not good for our military, to run them down, essentially, in the midst of a partisan political debate. The fact is that you've got to judge the military by what the military leaders say. And Secretary Bill Cohen, a good Republican, General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both will tell you that the American military is ready to meet any threat we may face in the world today. And the fact is, judging by its results from Desert Storm to the Balkans, Bosnia and Kosovo to the operations that are still being conducted to keep Saddam Hussein in the box in Iraq, the American military has performed brilliantly. In fact, this administration had turned around the drop in spending on the military that began in the mid-80's and went right through the Bush-Cheney administration and the early years of the Clinton administration. But now that's stopped. In fact, we passed the largest pay increase in a generation for our military. And the interesting fact here, in spite of the rhetoric that my opponent has just spoken, is that the -- reality is that if you look at our projected budgets for the next 10 years, Al Gore and I actually commit more than twice as much -- $100 billion -- in additional funding for our military than Governor Bush does. And their budget allows nothing additional for acquisition of new weapons systems. And that's something that the same general, Mike Ryan of the Air Force, and all the other chiefs of the services, will not be happy about because they need the new equipment, the new systems, that Al Gore and I are committed to giving them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And the fact is that Governor Bush recommended in his major policy statement on the military earlier this year that we skip the next generation of military equipment -- helicopters, submarines, tactical air-fighters, all the rest. That would really cripple our readiness, exactly the readiness that Dick Cheney is talking about.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Al Gore and I are committed to continuing this acquisition program, transforming the military. There's fewer people in uniform today but person to person -- person by person, unit by unit, this is the most powerful and effective military not only in the world today but in the history of the world. And again, Al Gore and I will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  I mean, America has a national strategic interest and a principled interest in peace in the Middle East. And Al Gore has played a critical role in advancing that process over the last eight years. What pains me as I watch the unrest in recent days between the Israelis and the Palestinians is that these two peoples have come, in some senses, generations forward, centuries forward in the last seven years. They are so close to a final peace agreement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now we've been on a very constructive course in the Middle East, played an unusual, unique role. And I am convinced that Al Gore and I, I commit that Al Gore and I will continue to do that. I hope I might, through my friendships in Israel and throughout the Arab world, play a unique role in bringing peace to this sacred region of the world.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. CHENEY  Bernie, it has been a very, very difficult area to work in for a long time. Numerous administrations going back, certainly to World War II, have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East. We made significant breakthroughs, I think, at the end of the Bush administration because of the Gulf War. In effect, we had joined together with Arab allies and done enormous damage to the Iraqi armed forces, and Iraq, at the time, was the biggest military threat to Israel. By virtue of the end of the cold war, the Soviets were no longer a factor. They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East. But with the end of the Soviet Union, the implosion, if you will, of the empire, that created a vacuum, if you will, and made it easier for us to operate there.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. SHAW  This question is for you, Mr. Secretary. If Iraq's President Saddam Hussein were found to be developing weapons of mass destruction, Governor Bush has said he would ''take him out.'' Would you agree with such a deadly policy?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The fact is that we will not enjoy real stability in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein is gone. The gulf war was a great victory. And incidentally, Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war, and we're both very proud that we did that.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in the end, there's not going to be peace until he goes. And that's why I was proud to co-sponsor the Iraq Liberation Act with Senator Trent Lott, why I have kept in touch with the indigenous Iraqi opposition broad based to Saddam Hussein. Vice President Gore met with them earlier this year. We are supporting them in their efforts and we will continue to support them until the Iraqi people rise up and do what the people of Serbia have done in the last few days, get rid of a despot. We will welcome you back into the family of nations where you belong.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LIEBERMAN  Not enough. But this administration and Vice President Gore and I have had both a long-term strategy to develop energy independence and a short-term strategy. In fact, if this administration had been given the amount of funding that it had requested from the Republican Congress, we'd be further along in the implementation of that long-term strategy which is aimed at developing alternative cleaner sources of energy aimed at giving tax credits to individuals and businesses to conserve and use energy more efficiently, aimed at a partnership for a new generation of vehicles with the American automobile industry which is making great progress and can produce a vehicle that can get 80 miles per gallon. We also have a short-term strategy and it's a deal with exactly the kind of ups and downs of energy prices and I know it was controversial. But Al Gore and I believed that it was important in the short term to reach into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, take some of that oil that we have, put it in the market, show the big oil companies and the OPEC oil-producing countries that we've got some resources with which we can fight back. We're not just going to lay back and let them roll over our economy. And we did it also because gasoline prices were rising and home heating oil inventories were real low. And both of our tickets agree on LIHAP, Low Income Housing Assistance Program, but our opponents really offer no assistance to middle-class families who are hit by rising gas prices and a shortage of home heating oil. The fact is that since the reserve was opened the price of oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel. Now that's a good result and I'm proud of it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LIEBERMAN  Ah, yes indeed. I can pledge to the American people categorically that no one will lose benefits under our plan for Social Security as far forward as 2054. And let me come back and say, Bernie, that Al Gore and I view Social Security as probably the best thing the government did in the second half of the last century. It has created a floor under which seniors cannot fall. And so many of them depend on it for their basic living, for their livelihood. It is critically important to protect it. That's why Al and I have committed to, to putting that Social Security surplus in a lock box, not touching it. And that's what allows us to keep Social Security solvent to 2054. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. CHENEY  You won't be surprised, Bernie, if I disagree with Joe's description of our program. The fact of the matter is the Social Security system's in trouble. It's been a fantastic program. It's been there for 65 years, it's provided benefits for -- for senior citizens over that period of time, for my parents. It means a great deal to -- to millions of Americans. And Governor Bush and I want to make absolutely certain that the first thing we do is guarantee the continuation of those payments, those benefits and keep those promises that were made.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But it's also why I'm so proud that Al Gore has said two things. First, we would issue, if we're fortunate enough to be elected, an executive order prohibiting racial profiling. And secondly, the first civil rights act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling. It is just wrong. It is un-American. And to think that in the 21st century this kind of nonsense is still going on, we've got to stop it.

  Mr. Gore may be doing well in the Northeast and on the West Coast, but he is struggling for a clear lead in his home state. A poll conducted last week for two major state newspapers showed Governor Bush slightly ahead here, though his lead was within the margin of sampling error.

  As many residents enjoy pointing out, one president from Tennessee, James K. Polk, did not carry his home state in 1844. Since the Civil War, party loyalties have been handed down like family Bibles, with Republicans in the east and Democrats dominating the west and middle. (Republicans now rule the growing suburbs of Memphis and Nashville.) The state has long been the South's most evenly divided, voting for Democrats, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter, in 1964, 1976 and 1980, and for Republicans, Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, in 1968, 1972, 1984 and 1988.

  The party's base is in the urban areas of Memphis and Nashville, and in the former pro-Confederate counties of western and middle Tennessee that have always been Democratic. At best, Mr. Wanderman said, he hopes that Mr. Gore will do a few points better than Mr. Clinton did in his two elections.

  But many Republicans say that next month's vote, even if Mr. Gore barely wins, could consolidate a trend away from partisan balance and toward a domination by the kind of moderate Republicans who do well here. Tennesseans remember that Mr. Gore's positions were notably more conservative when he was representing the state, said Dale R. Kelley, Huntingdon's Republican mayor.

  ''My sense is that Gore enjoyed a good deal more support in Tennessee when he was in Congress,'' said Mr. Kelley, a former state legislator who also served in former Gov. Lamar Alexander's cabinet. ''The changes that he made to run on the national ticket have changed the attitudes of this state.''

  Montana's political profile is decidedly Republican, with Mr. Bush expected to carry the state and Senator Conrad Burns a slight favorite to win a third term over his Democratic challenger, Brian Schweitzer. In other races, including those for governor and the House -- both open seats currently held by Republicans -- political experts say Democrats are holding a slight lead.

  Finally he began a story of how he had built a working relationship and friendship with his first lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, a Democrat. ''You tell your friend that I think I have the capacity to reach across the partisan line,'' Mr. Bush said, ''to elevate the spirit of America, to call upon the best of this nation, not to play partisan politics with every issue, but to focus on what's good for our citizens. Just tell her that and see if that doesn't work.''

  Watching the presidential debate on Tuesday night, I was disturbed by the way in which our prospective leaders viewed foreign policy (news article, Oct. 4). George W. Bush said the United States should intervene abroad only to protect its own interests. In other words, we should use the military if we have something to gain, but not to protect the lives and rights of those in oppressed countries.

  Mr. Clinton said he and Vice President Al Gore had found a ''third way'' to restore confidence in progressivism. With the challenges of record deficits and mounting national debt now behind the country, Mr. Clinton said, the country's next test will be to expand opportunity for people like the Navajo girl he met last week in New Mexico, who had won a computer but had no phone line; conquer diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis overseas; and bring the same success America has in business to the problems of families.

  As a mathematician, I was interested when, in the debate, George W. Bush described Al Gore's economic figures as ''fuzzy math'' (front page, Oct. 4). But I was chagrined when Mr. Bush left it at that. Although he repeated the phrase several times, he never discussed specific problems with Mr. Gore's reasoning or his figures, nor did he offer any alternatives. I gradually came to understand that by ''fuzzy math'' Mr. Bush meant, ''Math is confusing and fuzzy, so ignore it.''

  This predilection of Mr. Gore's is all the more surprising because it often involves trivial matters -- ones that could easily be checked -- such as how Mr. Gore recalled a childhood lullaby that did not exist.

  Mr. Gore's most recent troubles began with the first question of the debate. The moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS, noted that Mr. Gore had once questioned whether his opponent had the experience to be president and asked him what he meant. Mr. Gore denied that he had ever raised questions about Mr. Bush's qualifications for the presidency. The truth is, he had. In a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors in April, Mr. Gore cited Mr. Bush's call for a tax cut and posed this question: ''Does he have the experience to be president?''
 </textdata>

  At another point, Mr. Gore said he had traveled with James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to inspect fire and flooding damage in Texas in June 1998. In fact, Mr. Gore went to Texas, but not with Mr. Witt.
 </textdata>

  At another point, Mr. Gore said he ''took a risk'' in asking the former Prime Minister of Russia, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, to become personally involved in negotiating an end to the conflict in Kosovo. In fact, President Boris Yeltsin of Russia had two weeks early designated Mr. Chernomyrdin as a special envoy to the Balkans and the diplomatic mission that Mr. Gore described had been initiated by other top officials in Russia, Europe and the United States.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''In the debates, when he said that I spent more in my campaign than he has, the numbers show that he has spent twice as much as I have,'' Mr. Gore said. ''But I don't seize on that as evidence of some character flaw. He made a mistake, and I'm not going to attack him personally.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  In another interview months ago, Mr. Gore tried to make light of questions at the time about his exaggerations, turning to the reporter and blurting, ''I think it's an exaggeration!''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Rather than explain Mr. Gore's misstatements, one of his aides, Mark Fabiani, focused on Mr. Bush, saying, ''We've never attacked Bush for his numerous crimes against the English language.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  People who know Mr. Gore have suggested that he was reared in a political family where embellishments were part of life. And Mr. Gore spent his childhood in a way that was intended for use in a press release.

  His mother, Pauline, used to tell reporters that she would have dinner with her son no matter what else was going on. ''Nothing lonelier than a meal eaten alone,'' she would say. The truth is, Mr. Gore was alone a lot.
 </textdata>

  10-6-2000

 <textdata>
  Several prominent Democrats said privately that they were worried that Mr. Gore was giving ammunition to his opponents. Indeed, Mr. Bush and the Republicans have gleefully seized on Mr. Gore's statements.

  ''The press has been too easy on him on this,'' said Bill Pascoe, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ''If the only thing you knew about Al Gore was what you read in the press, you'd think he was just a charming fellow who loves his wife.''

  Robert Schmuhl, a professor of American studies at the University of Notre Dame, said Mr. Gore should take greater care to watch what he says.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's reaching a point where a stereotype might form and we might think of Gore as someone who is prone to exaggeration,'' Mr. Schmuhl said. ''That's a real danger for someone who is trying to run for president without the strain of character questions or problems of credibility.''
 </textdata>

  Pennsylvania has one of the nation's largest state-run drug-subsidy programs for its older low-income residents. So it seemed natural for Gov. George W. Bush to choose it last month as the place to announce his program to help states ease drug costs for those on Medicare.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The thrust of Mr. Bush's proposal is to let managed care companies compete for patients with Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people 65 or older. Since the plan would not take effect for at least four years, Mr. Bush has proposed an interim step of allocating $48 billion -- $12 billion a year -- to subsidize state prescription drug plans.

  How effective Mr. Bush's proposed federal subsidies would be in solving these problems is in dispute.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Marilyn Moon, a Medicare expert at the Urban Institute, said that Mr. Bush's interim plan would fall short by its fourth and final year because more people would ask for help and drug prices would probably continue to rise.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In addition, more than half the  states have neither established nor authorized programs. For those states, the Bush proposal would require a new bureaucracy, said John McDonough, a former Massachusetts legislator who helped write that state's first drug-subsidy law.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-6-2000

 <textdata>
  ''If Congress and Governor Bush want to unload this responsibility on states that weren't asking for the programs, it will be much more difficult to reach the target populations quickly.''

  The latest spots by the Bush campaign and the Republican Party, meanwhile, take a much softer tack: in fact, two new Bush commercials that began running yesterday in many swing states merely reiterate the governor's thoughts and ideas about education, an issue he has promoted on television since the New Hampshire primary.

  ''Parents need tools to help them protect and nurture their families,'' Mr. Bush says in one of the new spots. In the other, he says, ''How come the hard things don't get done? Because they're hard. If we want to make sure no child gets left behind in America, we need the courage to do some tough things.''

  The Democrats' continuing emphasis on Mr. Bush's home-state record is a reflection of a strategy of attack that has been tried in all recent elections against sitting or former governors who secure their party nomination for president. In the last 25 years, political analysts say, the tactic has succeeded only once, when then-Vice President George Bush famously disparaged Michael S. Dukakis's record in Massachusetts on pollution in Boston Harbor and shortcomings in a state prison furlough program.

  The sharp critiques issued by the Gore campaign and its supporters, Mr. West said, have placed the Democrats in an unconventional position. ''There's been a role reversal in this election, because typically the challenger goes on attack and the incumbent stays above the fray,'' he observed. ''And here you have Gore playing the challenger role.''

  In its new video, the Democratic National Committee interviews several Texans with complaints about what they say are the Bush administration's neglectful attitudes about their problems. One segment features the destitute hamlets, or colonias, that are home to some of the poorest Texans. ''Governor Bush has never visited a colonia, so to the extent that that shows how much of a priority it is for him, may the American public decide,'' a former colonia resident comments.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

  The Bush campaign took issue with that assertion, declaring in a statement that the governor had visited colonias ''three times'' while inspecting flood damage and being briefed on water and sewage problems.

  As Race Tightens, Gore Takes No State for Granted  Vice President Al Gore is devoting virtually his entire week to campaigning in smaller states that he should be able ignore -- even his home state, Tennessee -- instead of scrapping for votes in large swing states like Ohio and Michigan. With only two weeks to go until the election, Mr. Gore's schedule reflects the down-to-the-wire nature of the campaign and the way that factors as disparate as his personality and Ralph Nader's candidacy are playing havoc with the electoral map.

  Two daily tracking polls show that Vice President Gore has regained some of the ground he recently lost to Gov. George W. Bush. When four of the polls taken since the last debate are averaged together, Mr. Bush's support is 46 percent, Mr. Gore's 44 percent, Patrick J. Buchanan's 1 percent and Mr. Nader's 4 percent.

  Hitting Back on Social Security  Gov. George W. Bush said Vice President Al Gore's Social Security plan would create about $40 trillion in debt by the middle of the century, saddling future generations with a burden and leaving the system of financing the program unfixed.

  Different Tacks on Political Ads  National and local Democratic officials fanned out to nearly 100 cities in 20 contested states to introduce a video assailing Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas on matters like air quality, schools, medical care and the poor. The latest Republican campaign advertisements take a much softer tack, with two ads merely reiterating the governor's thoughts and ideas on education.

  Gone are his leisurely strolls down memory lane; long absent is the once standard story of his father showing him slave chains in an old house in Tennessee. Gone is the fascination with suburban sprawl and traffic jams and lost luggage at airports, the focus on the hassles of daily life that threatened to turn the presidential campaign into a contest for the local zoning board. And, now that the three official debates are over and Mr. Gore has emerged in a weaker position than when he went into them, gone is his constant clamor for two or three debates a week. Gone too are the jokes, if not the humor.

  Mr. Gore is now focused almost single-mindedly on what he calls ''the big choices'': Social Security, Medicare, health care, education and the economy. He has boiled his message down to its essence, a math problem, basically, that in his view has only one right answer: Mr. Gore would use the budget surplus responsibly, with discipline, while Gov. George W. Bush would squander it and drive the nation to ruin.

  ''Prosperity itself is on the ballot,'' Mr. Gore declares now in his most succinct argument for his candidacy. Coupled with this is a phrase that Governor Bush used against him in their first debate and that Mr. Gore has appropriated with great glee. ''Fuzzy math!'' Mr. Gore often shouts as he picks apart Mr. Bush's proposals for a tax cut and privatizing part of Social Security. ''Fuzzy math!'' To the disciplined Mr. Gore, this is a huge failing, and it seems to stick in his craw that Mr. Bush used it against him first.

  The new urgency was evident here on Saturday night, in a high school gymnasium so stuffy that the formal Mr. Gore rolled up his shirt sleeves and mopped his face with a white handkerchief as he delivered in a crisp 18 minutes the essentials of his message. The crowd of several hundred people was cheering most of the time and the acoustics were terrible, circumstances that forced the often wordy Mr. Gore to cut short his tendencies to overinstruct an audience and speak in run-on sentences.

  The larger circumstances -- Governor Bush's tiny lead in the polls, the nearness of Election Day, the demands on his dwindling time -- also forced him into a more direct message, leaving behind the desultory ramble through the high points of his parents' careers to a sharp and urgent plea for help on the eve of the closest presidential race in 40 years.

  All year Mr. Gore has been trying to sort out how to take credit for the economy without bragging and without casting himself as President Clinton's eclipsed No. 2. He lays out the facts as he has all year, saying: ''We've turned the biggest deficits into the biggest surpluses. Instead of triple-dip recessions, we've seen a tripling of the stock market. Instead of high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American unemployment ever measured, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured, 22 million new jobs and the strongest economy in the 224-year history of the United States of America.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has also dropped most references to himself. After months of ''introducing'' himself to the public, Mr. Gore is spending these final frantic weeks insisting that the race is about issues, not about personality. ''This is not about me and it's not about Governor Bush,'' he says in nearly every speech. ''It is about you and your family.''

  As Mr. Gore emerged from his vice presidential shell, he was forced into a public search for a personal narrative to explain who he was and where he came from. For months, he dwelled on stories about his parents, whose up-from-the-hollers grit seemed more inspirational than the facts of Mr. Gore's own life, in which the drama was internal and the journey abstract.

  He talked about climbing Mount Rainier with his son, an arduous experience that he translated on the campaign trail into vague thoughts about scanning the horizon. Another staple was a line from the movie, ''Grand Canyon,'' in which a character says, ''It's not supposed to be this way.'' Mr. Gore often quoted Gandhi, saying, ''You must become the change you wish to see in the world.'' Another favorite was a line from the Spanish poet Antonio Machado: ''Traveler, there is no path. You make your path as you travel.''

  In these final urgent days, the elaborate scaffolding that Mr. Gore had constructed to help build his identity has fallen away. Now, he relates only essential biographical facts that serve a direct purpose.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  What Mr. Gore has kept in his speech and what he has discarded is a response in part to changing political realities. In the primaries, for example, he would say that Mr. Bradley had not been a good Democrat. (Mr. Gore complained that Mr. Bradley ''quit'' the Senate after the Republicans took over and considered challenging the incumbent Democratic president, Mr. Clinton, in 1996.) Now that he is trying to win over independents and moderate Republicans, Mr. Gore tells audiences that he himself had a reputation in Congress as someone who worked across party lines. With this in mind, he has toned down the raging populism of early September. While he remains an advocate of abortion rights, he has begun to speak of seeking ''common ground'' with abortion opponents.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The changing stump speech is also a reflection of what has worked and what has not. Mr. Gore has stopped branding Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal a ''risky tax scheme,'' a phrase his top advisers concluded sounded too cliched and too harsh. He has also given up his promise for ''revolutionary change'' in education, a concept that left audiences more puzzled than energized. But he has not abandoned his assertion that ''we need to make education our No. 1 priority.''

  Since ''Saturday Night Live'' made fun of him after the first debate for using the arcane word ''lockbox'' to describe where he would put the Social Security trust fund, Mr. Gore has been more self-conscious about the word. ''Use whatever word you want,'' he will say, but he will often fall back on lockbox.

  Topics that once loomed large have vanished altogether. He used to talk at length about gun control, pledging to make an issue of Mr. Bush's having signed a bill to allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons to church. But pro-gun commercials in hunter-heavy swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan have forced him to scale back. Now, as he did in the debates, Mr. Gore emphasizes that he does not want to take firearms away from sportsmen.

  At that rally and one in Des Moines, Mr. Bush hammered at Mr. Gore's plan to keep Social Security solvent into the middle of the century by paying down the national debt, then funneling the savings from interest payments into Social Security.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides said the Gore plan was basically an accounting trick, a transfer of money from one place to another that would ultimately force the government to reduce spending or raise taxes. Mr. Gore's aides disputed that characterization.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, by contrast, has proposed allowing younger workers to invest some of their payroll taxes in private retirement accounts, saying that they would get a higher return on the money. That, presumably, would relieve pressure on the Social Security system and would create a new source of financing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush has not explained how he would make this fundamental change without, at some point, having to pump extra money into Social Security or reduce benefits. Many experts have said that the cost of this transition could be formidable.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore and other Democrats had spent much of the last week challenging Mr. Bush on that point and charging that he was endangering Social Security's ability to pay benefits to current retirees.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush called that a scare tactic and produced the staggeringly high $40 trillion figure, guaranteed to grab headlines, to press his criticism that Mr. Gore was not reaching for bold solutions but simply reverting to an ingrained Democratic impulse to spend and spend.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  ''That's not leadership,'' Mr. Bush told workers at an ink manufacturing plant in Des Moines. ''That's not somebody who's willing to take on the tough issues and lead.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides said the $40 trillion figure was the amount, plus interest payments, that the government would have to transfer from the general fund into Social Security  by 2050 to keep the system solvent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The number came from a letter that the Congressional Budget Office sent last week to Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, in response to an inquiry about the president's Social Security plan. Bush aides said the vice president's plan was identical.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Gore aides questioned the arithmetic behind the number, along with the way the Bush campaign was interpreting it. They said the Bush campaign was ignoring a central fact: that the money Mr. Gore was proposing to transfer from the general fund to Social Security would be newly created savings on interest payments for the national debt.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

  ''George W. Bush is trying to make voters as confused as he is,'' said Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign. ''This is a highly desperate attempt.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But it illustrated how much attention Social Security was getting and how eager Mr. Bush was to frame his position as an example of the kind of innovative, fresh leadership he has pledged to take to Washington.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

  He characterized Mr. Gore and the current administration as impediments to progress on issues like Social Security and Medicare because, Mr. Bush suggested, they were too mired in stale thinking and too addicted to partisan warfare.

  ''The Clinton-Gore administration has blocked reform at every turn,'' Mr. Bush said in Kansas City, Mo.
 </textdata>

  10-24-2000

  The language Mr. Bush used to deride Mr. Gore was as sharp as it had ever been, reflecting the tightness of the contest and the little time  before Election Day.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The fanfare with which his rallies and events were staged also reflected this. In Milwaukee, where Mr. Bush ended the day, he appeared before thousands of people in an enormous auditorium. On stage with him were most of the women -- including his wife, Laura, and Cindy McCain, the wife of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona -- who had participated in a ''W Stands for Women'' tour in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

  Mr. Bush punched several themes today. He stressed that Mr. Gore did not trust Americans to make their own decisions, which is what he said people would be doing under his Social Security plan. He also contended that a Gore government would be a nonstop spending spree and, in doing so, seemed to indulge in the kind of partisan broadsides he was saying that a Bush administration would transcend.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For example, he repeatedly sought to lump Mr. Gore with two liberal, failed Democratic presidential nominees, Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis, by saying that their combined spending proposals were less than Mr. Gore's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

 <textdata>
  During this campaign, Americans have seen my priorities. They have seen the issues near to my heart: better schools, fairer taxes, a stronger military, security for our seniors. These reforms are coming to Washington, D.C. In truth, in truth, we should have had them a long time ago. But something stood in the way. The Clinton-Gore administration has blocked reform at every turn. It came in  with ringing promises, and is now leaving with a sigh. For seven and a half years, the vice president has been the second biggest obstacle to reform in America. And now he wants to be the biggest. And now he wants to be the obstacle in chief.''

  The debate over when America should become involved in foreign strife surfaced again last week as a presidential campaign issue when George W.

  Mr. Lazio supports what he calls ''global engagement,'' but on a more limited level.

  Florida is the biggest prize up for grabs in the presidential contest between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. (Of the three more populous states, California and New York appear to be in Mr. Gore's column, and Texas in Mr. Bush's.) As a result, Mr. Gore and his running mate, Mr. Lieberman, have treated Florida like a second home.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

  Though Mr. Bush holds a slim lead in national surveys -- two percentage points in a New York Times/CBS News Poll poll published today -- Democratic and Republican strategists say he needs Florida's 25 electoral votes to win the presidency.

  Speaking to 1,000 people today at the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center, in a Miami suburb, Mr. Lieberman took issue with Mr. Bush's call to withdraw American forces from peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia and Kosovo. Echoing statements made by Mr. Gore on Sunday, Mr. Lieberman said such a withdrawal would ''wound'' the NATO alliance. He suggested that Mr. Bush's understanding of world affairs was lacking, and drew a contrast to Mr. Gore.

  ''I think you've got to consider the extraordinary experience Al Gore has had in foreign policy and military matters, and it's one of the reasons to vote for him,'' he said. ''If Governor Bush thinks he's going to pull American soldiers out of peace-keeping in Europe, he hasn't learned the lessons of the two world wars we fought and the cold war.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

  A spokesman for the Bush campaign, Dan Bartlett, said that in their Oct. 11 debate, Mr. Gore had agreed with Mr. Bush about withdrawing forces from the Balkans, and called the criticism ''puzzling.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore said at the debate that troops should be sent home ''as soon as the mission is complete.'' Mr. Bush is seeking a complete American withdrawal from such missions, which Mr. Gore has never supported.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In that debate, Mr. Bush also seemed to blunder, saying that the European allies should ''put troops on the ground'' in the Balkans, when they already supply more than 80 percent of the peacekeepers there.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

  On the Mideast, Mr. Lieberman, the first Jew on a major party's national ticket, told the synagogue audience that while he and Mr. Gore would pursue a peace treaty, ''we will also not forget the ties of values and strategic interests and alliance that tie the United States of America and Israel together now for 50-plus years.'' That has essentially been the American position for decades. But President Clinton has tried not to appear to take sides as he seeks to broker an Israeli-Palestinian settlement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

  Mr. Lieberman's remarks could play into the fears of Arab-Americans. The Arab-American Political Action Committee recently endorsed Mr. Bush, with some members concerned that Mr. Lieberman would not be impartial on the Mideast.

Yesterday, the same poll showed a two-point edge for Mr. Bush based on interviews conducted Friday through Sunday.

  The choice is very clear. The contrast is very stark. We have a choice between two candidates. But it's not about me or Governor Bush. It is about you and your family and your city and your future.

  Now let me tell you what the other side has proposed. They have proposed a tax cut for the very wealthy, a very big tax cut for the wealthy that gives almost half of the benefits to the top 1 percent. In the debates just concluded, the moderator, Jim Lehrer, asked Governor Bush whether or not it was true what I was saying about his massive tax cuts for the wealthy and whether or not it benefits the top 1 percent so much and Governor Bush's answer was, ''Of course it does.'' Does that represent the wrong priority for America? Of course it does! Is that the wrong choice for our future? Of course it is.

  One need not side with Al Gore or George W. Bush to show concern for the country or civic commitment.

  The campaign is ticking by and the alarm meter among the Democratic faithful is ticking up. What happened to the Vice President Al Gore who made the smashing convention speech in Los Angeles and seemed ready to snatch Florida away from Gov. George W. Bush? How did the Democrats' Great Debater manage to let Mr. Bush slip-slide away with generalities about leadership and Beltway bickering? Finally, is it time to send out an S O S to the most restless lame duck in modern presidential campaign history?

  Mr. Gore, for his part, faces both a generic and a specific problem. Vice presidents as different as Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey and George H. W. Bush have faced the general problem of stepping out of the shadow of large, and in some cases flawed, figures. Mr. Gore's special problem is that his senior partner's main achievement -- the best economic record in modern times -- ought to be a highly marketable political advantage. But when Mr. Gore dwells on Mr. Clinton's record, he plays into two main themes of the Bush campaign. Those are that Mr. Bush will bring a loftier standard of personal behavior to the Oval Office and that, in the long view, character is more important than experience.

  From the standpoint of the Bush campaign, the more prominence for Mr. Clinton the better. Bush strategists had hoped all along to run against the president's personal reputation rather than Mr. Gore's policies. They profess to welcome a more prominent role for Mr. Clinton and see his direct attacks on Mr. Bush as actually adding to the governor's stature by elevating him to the presidential plateau.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's not inconsiderable ego also played a role in the construction of the tactical box in which he finds himself. Since midway in the second term he has been hoping to run as the candidate who could deliver Clintonism without all that Arkansas-Lewinsky-Lincoln-Bedroom baggage. Now as his fellow Democrats are getting jumpy and talking about Mr. Clinton as an unused campaign resource, Mr. Gore needs to have the discipline to stick to the plan implicit in his convention declaration that ''I stand here tonight as my own man.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the president ought to discipline his tendency to upstage and undercut Mr. Gore with speeches in which the subtext is, ''Hey, Al, here's how you make the case.'' Although Mr. Bush is holding a small, steady lead, neither candidate has closed the deal with the swing voters. Moreover, the decisive opinion shifts could come very late. Mr. Gore's best strategy is to remain the star of his campaign, no matter how loudly Mr. Clinton clears his throat and taps his foot.

  Mr. Bush's proposal to privatize part of Social Security would undermine the system while handing a windfall to Wall Street. Similarly, the Bush plan for prescription drugs would subsidize or bribe insurance companies to induce them to offer coverage to the public -- still another layer of corporate welfare. A Bush administration would be a large step in the direction of government of, by and for the rich.

  Sharp contrasts emerged over the weekend in the way the Bush and Gore campaigns view America's proper military role in Europe. The debate began when Condoleezza Rice, one of Gov. George W. Bush's leading foreign policy advisers, told The Times's Michael Gordon that a Bush administration would ask European members of NATO to gradually take over full responsibility for providing peacekeeping forces for Bosnia and Kosovo. Vice President Gore countered that carrying out such a policy could destabilize the Balkans and jeopardize the future of NATO, America's most important military alliance.

 <textdata>
  Debates over how and where United States military forces should be stationed are a healthy part of presidential contests. Ms. Rice's proposal is consistent with the Bush campaign's view that extended peacekeeping missions degrade the combat readiness of American military forces and that the Pentagon should concentrate its resources on preparing for crises where Washington alone has the might to deter, and, if necessary, combat aggression, whether in the Persian Gulf, the Korean Peninsula or a future military conflict in Europe.

  Asking Europe to accept a total withdrawal of American ground forces from the Balkans needlessly challenges some of the basic assumptions of the Western military alliance. NATO was formed not just to counter Soviet bloc military threats. It was also designed to eliminate some of the historic military rivalries in Europe that led to two world wars. NATO provides a framework for European and American forces to cooperate in joint operations under a single overall commander -- traditionally an American. Europe cannot be expected to accept an alliance in which Washington exercises political and military leadership but does not subject its own forces to any of the risks of ground operations. The Bush campaign is right when it insists that the United States must be selective in where it stations ground forces. But the Balkans is not the place to cut back.

  Nothing about campaigns is fair. It isn't fair that the vice president could lose the presidency because he's cursed with a dorky demeanor. It isn't fair that women who have been in public life for decades still get letters from their constituents about their haircuts. However, to be totally comparable, you'd have had to have a debate in which Al Gore invaded the space of, say, Liddy Dole, just after one member of an all-male panel of journalists asked her a really mean question about those Viagra commercials.

  Technology and money have combined to create opportunities for political consultants that never existed before. For instance, Hank Sheinkopf, a pollster in the last Clinton campaign, has found that even a county commissioner candidate in Indiana can afford to hire him. And there are whole new lines of business. For instance, telemarketers, like Winning Connections, based in Washington, tap into computer data banks to call 500,000 targeted voters in three days. Or people like Michael Connell, manager of the Bush campaign Internet strategy, represent new types of consulting.

  Mr. Gore, the Democratic nominee, will have campaigned in 11 states by the end of a week that began on Sunday afternoon in New Mexico and winds up on Friday in Pennsylvania. All 11 were won by President Clinton and Mr. Gore in  1992 and 1996, with the Democrats winning most by comfortable margins, often by double digits.

  The campaign swing includes  West Virginia, which has voted Republican only twice since 1960. And Mr. Gore will spend part of both Tuesday and Wednesday campaigning in Tennessee, where he has not  lost a race in a political career that dates to 1976. His Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, also plans to campaign in Tennessee on Tuesday.

  The vice president's struggle to solidify his geographic base stems from several factors, political analysts said. Some are national, like his inability to reassure voters about his credibility and amiability, and the lingering tendency of some voters to associate Mr. Gore with a scandal-ridden White House. Others are more localized, including demographic changes in some states and the strength of Mr. Nader, the Green Party candidate, in places like the Pacific Northwest and Wisconsin.

  Mr. Gore does seem to enjoy substantial leads in California and New York, and his postconvention travel to those states has largely been limited to fund-raising and television tapings. He has also forced Mr. Bush to compete in Florida, where Mr. Bush's brother is governor.

  But while campaigning in closely contested Oregon and Washington in the last two days, Mr. Gore has been forced to reach out to the disaffected Democrats who form the core of Mr. Nader's base. At rallies in Portland, Ore., on Sunday night and here today, he devoted more time than usual to promoting his environmental record, a critical issue for the Green Party.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I will fight to protect the environment with all my heart and soul,'' Mr. Gore told supporters here in an open airport hangar. In Portland last night, Mr. Gore vowed to ''protect ancient forests'' and to ''block new roads and timber sales in our roadless forests and ancient forest areas.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

 <textdata>
  Part of his strategy to reclaim Nader supporters rests on raising fears about a Bush presidency.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''My opponent in his state of Texas put a lobbyist for the chemical companies in charge of enforcing the environmental laws there,'' Mr. Gore said today. ''On his watch, Texas has sunk down to 50th out of all 50 in industrial pollution, the worst state for industrial pollution, with the smoggiest city, Houston, and over all the smoggiest state.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Gore was even more explicit  when reporters aboard Air Force Two asked him about Mr. Nader.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore added that it was not his task to convince Americans that a vote for Mr. Nader was a vote for Mr. Bush. ''That may be true,'' he said, ''but my task is to convince them to vote enthusiastically for me and for what I represent.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat who represents a Seattle district, said Mr. Gore would probably not have to campaign in Washington at this point were it not for Mr. Nader. ''Gore has to get his base out in states like this,'' Mr. McDermott said, ''and when you add in factors like Nader it throws in a few points.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000

 <textdata>
  But other Democratic leaders said Mr. Gore was still not receiving credit for the prosperity enjoyed during the Clinton administration, and they attributed his troubles to personality and style.

  ''The vice president, in a small group, one on one, is incredibly funny, he's charming, he's knowledgeable,'' Mr. Wu said. ''We need to free Al Gore, let Al Gore be Al Gore.''

  Mr. Gore was certainly in full voice today, feeling energized, aides said, by positive signs in several recent polls. He pledged to continue to speak in detail about issues until the final hours of the campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Fifteen days is a long time if your objective is to hold the ball and run out the clock,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Fifteen days is a long time if you are trying to hide behind tracking polls and not engage in the issues because the people disagree with you on the issues. That's the dilemma that my opponent faces in the next 15 days.''

''Why Voting for a Candidate Who Can't Win Is the Smartest Thing You'll Ever Do,'' the advertisement reads, ''And Don't Worry, a Vote for Nader is Not a Vote for Bush.'' The campaign is meant to appeal to independents, former supporters of Senator John McCain's Republican candidacy and ''disgruntled Democrats'' who might otherwise sit out the election, said Greg MacArthur, whose group, Citizens for Strategic Voting, paid for the advertisements.

  Yesterday, an American Muslim political action committee, representing four Muslim organizations, endorsed Gov. George W. Bush, saying he had been accessible to Muslim organizations and had showed himself responsive to their concerns over sensitive issues like deportation. The PAC is a branch of the two-year-old American Muslim Political Coordinating Council, made up of the American Muslim Alliance, American Muslim Council, the Council on American-Islamic Affairs and the Muslim Public Affairs Council. Aly Abuzaakouk , the Coordinating Council's executive director, said Mr. Bush had met with American Muslim leaders last March in Austin and in general had been ''more responsive to us than the Al Gore campaign.''

  EMBATTLED TEXAS OFFICIAL RESIGNS -- The Texas Commissioner of Health, Dr. William R. Archer III, whose comments on race, cultural attitudes and health insurance, have embarrassed his boss, George W. Bush, resigned yesterday. The move came less than a week after he was placed on leave after statements about race were secretly recorded by a black female employee who had been fired. She filed a discrimination complaint. Dr. Archer's tongue also got him into trouble last spring, when he played down the importance of health insurance and blamed the state's high teenage pregnancy rate on the cultural attitudes of Hispanics. Dr. Archer also had come under criticism for his management of the agency.

 <textdata>
  The same scene was repeated in 13 other contested states today as the Bush presidential campaign rolled out one of the most complex and expensive political operations ever undertaken. Acting on the popularity of many governors and the perception that they are Washington outsiders, the campaign hired private jets for seven teams of them (at prices that approached $5,000 an hour per aircraft), found places for them to speak and arranged for drivers to ferry them and restaurants to feed them. In all, 28 of Mr. Bush's fellow Republican governors joined the effort; only Cecil H. Underwood of West Virginia, running hard in his own race, for re-election, did not.

  The division of labor was for the most part constant: Ms. Whitman talked about tax cuts, Mr. Ridge about education, and Mr. Schafer about Social Security and prescription drug plans. Jeb Bush, who accompanied the tour on only one stop, in Palm Beach, talked about his brother's learning curve.

  ''We've been looking for an energy policy for the last eight years from the Clinton-Gore administration, and there isn't one,'' said Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, speaking at a gas station just outside Philadelphia, where Team 1 had been dispatched. ''In fact, I sometimes think Saddam Hussein is running the oil policy for this administration.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many of the governors happily echoed Mr. Bush's belief that they are more respected around the country than other politicians, particularly the ones who work in Washington. In fact, an important theme of the three-day Barnstorm for Reform tour, which will reach 25 states in all, was to play up the hard-charging, problem-solving persona of the state executive. The campaign clearly hopes that this image will embrace Mr. Bush, even though the governor's office in Texas is one of the nation's least powerful.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Left unsaid were many of the policy differences between factions of Republican governors. Mr. Ridge and Ms. Whitman support abortion rights, for instance, and Mr. Bush opposes it.

 <textdata>
  He tried to cast doubt on Mr. Bush's claim that he is the only presidential candidate who could work well with both major parties, pointing to several of his own initiatives that received bipartisan support.  ''The Democrats favor bipartisanship and our record is that,'' he said to applause.

  Mr. Clinton has not appeared at campaign rallies with Mr. Gore, and Gore aides say that will not change. Indeed, the men have appeared together in public only once since the Democratic National Convention: at a brief airport encounter in Missouri, where they were attending a memorial service for Gov. Mel Carnahan, who died last week.

  After that service, Mr. Clinton denied a report in The New York Times that he had been upset at Mr. Gore for not involving him more actively in the campaign. And he promised to ''do whatever's best'' to help the Gore-Lieberman ticket, deferring the specifics to Mr. Gore.

  In another swipe, the president scoffed at Mr. Bush's contention that Mr. Gore wants to protect ''big government.'' Mr. Clinton boasted that the federal government had 300,000 fewer workers than when he took office in 1993, and that he had eliminated 16,000 pages of federal regulations. He also said that Mr. Bush's tax cut plan was fiscally foolish, and that Mr. Gore's proposed tax cut was rightly smaller because ''we've got to have some money to invest in education, in health care, in the future of the country.''

  At a midafternoon rally for Gov. George W. Bush that kicked off three days of barnstorming across 25 battleground states, the 28 governors stood on a three-tiered stage, laughing as they found their assigned places marked on the floor with tape. It was a gathering intended to reinforce Mr. Bush's theme that he represented a more pragmatic style of leadership distinct from the partisanship of Washington.

  While Mr. Bush reveled in the support of the governors, he has studiously avoided any such display with members of Congress, whom he has associated with the gridlock and partisanship in Washington.

  As soon as the rally ended, the governors were descended upon by reporters, and they had scheduled an additional 40 interviews by satellite in crucial states. The governors signed an advertisement in support of Mr. Bush, which is to run in USA Today on Monday. The one Republican governor not at the rally was Cecil H. Underwood of West Virginia, who is in a tough re-election fight.

  The scene marked the ascendancy of the gubernatorial wing of the Republican Party, which began battling for more sway after the midterm election of 1998 when more than a dozen Republican governors were re-elected, including Mr. Bush.

''They've followed interesting strategies at the state level that are very similar to what Governor Bush talks about at the federal level. We've cut taxes. We've emphasized education. We've strengthened the fundamentals. We've strengthened our state's budgets, reformed the process of doing the budget in many of our states.''

  ''Before the debates in '80, just as in 2000, there was this attack levied against Ronald Reagan that all he'd ever been was this two-term governor of California,'' Mr. Engler said. ''Well, that's what they said about George Bush: Gee, he's only a two-term governor of Texas running against this very experienced individual, the incumbent, the vice president. Bush, I think, by doing so well in the debates and by being such an  engaging personality, people have said, 'Not only do I think he's able to do the job, I really like him.' ''

  At the beginning of the final phase of the presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush is clinging to the narrow lead in the polls that he has held the last two weeks. Vice President Al Gore is even sounding like an underdog, with his combative promises to ''fight for you,'' while Mr. Bush has returned to the safety of his early theme of wanting to unite Americans. The governor's standing is a tribute to his effectiveness at the debates, where he held his own against a more experienced, knowledgeable and aggressive opponent. If Mr. Gore is to win, he will have to build on his own assets, talk more about the Democrats' economic record and somehow sharpen his attack on Mr. Bush without alienating voters.

  Poll results, even those two weeks before an election, are not necessarily indicative of how the vote will turn out. Since the 1960's, the trends have often shifted in the closing weeks. There were last-minute surges by underdogs in 1960 (Richard Nixon), 1968 (Hubert Humphrey), 1976 (President Gerald Ford) and 1992 (President George Bush), although none of them won. But in 1980, Ronald Reagan pulled ahead of Jimmy Carter only a few days before the election, largely on the basis of his debate performance and a last-minute collapse of a possible deal to free the hostages in Iran.

  According to the historian Michael Beschloss, the candidate judged by the electorate to have won the debate or debates has almost always won. This year, that predictive element is confused. Mr. Gore was widely judged to have won the first and third debates, but the public appears to have come away thinking that Mr. Bush passed a threshold of acceptability as a presidential candidate. As the latest Times/CBS News survey suggests, voters may be more comfortable with Mr. Bush's lack of experience than they are with what they take to be Mr. Gore's condescending manner. In the end, Mr. Gore has little choice but to emphasize the issues and hope for the best because, as the Times survey shows, those issues are his greatest strength.

  In sketching their different leadership styles, each candidate claims his approach will bring faster results. Mr. Gore sees the presidency as a place where a leader must fight against special interests. Mr. Bush sees leadership as the art of bringing people together to find a reasonable solution.

  The final weeks of a campaign are also a time when voters take one last measure of the competence and readiness of the candidates. In 1976 and 1992, last-minute doubts about Mr. Carter and Mr. Clinton almost persuaded voters to stick with the person they knew could handle the job. Over the weekend, Mr. Gore began trying to stir similar feelings in the electorate by questioning whether the governor understood the dangerous repercussions that could come from his proposal to withdraw American troops from their peacekeeping missions in the Balkans. At the same time, Mr. Gore is struggling to maintain his identity as ''my own man'' by keeping President Clinton's involvement in the campaign to a minimum.

  Each candidate advocates the brand of leadership that fits his personality. Does Mr. Bush lack details on policies? He makes a virtue of it by saying that the details on prescription drug policies are less important than the fact that he, and not Mr. Gore, will be able to get some kind of bill enacted. Mr. Gore's embrace of specific proposals on an array of issues, from education to health to tax cuts, may not bring the love and affection of the voters. But his declared willingness to ''fight'' on the big issues, contrasted with Mr. Bush's conservative agenda and advocacy of amorphous bipartisanship, lays out a dramatic choice in the final two weeks. Voters could be wrestling with it until the very end.

  Eight points behind in the widely followed Epic-MRA poll a mere three weeks ago, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has caught up with Vice President Al Gore, and few politicians here will venture a prediction as to who will win this most hotly contested of the big swing states in the 2000 campaign. The poll, taken after the final presidential debate and published in The Detroit Free Press, showed Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore with 43 percent each and Ralph Nader with 4 percent, with 10 percent of those surveyed either undecided or backing other candidates.

  Yet one prominent Democrat is missing: President Clinton. Several Michigan Democratic leaders said this week that Mr. Clinton was badly needed to help boost turnout among blacks and union members. But so far the vice president has not asked him to campaign here; Mr. Clinton is scheduled to appear in California, where the race is much less close, but not in this pivotal state. Apparently Mr. Gore fears being overshadowed, or casting new light on old White House scandals, or both.

  Mr. Bush is also holding one weapon back: Senator John McCain of Arizona, his former rival for the Republican nomination. Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, and his mother, Barbara, kicked off their ''W Stands for Women'' drive here, crossing the state by bus on Wednesday, in an effort to cut into Mr. Gore's lead among women. Mr. Bush's father, former President George Bush, is scheduled to stump in Holland, Grand Rapids and Detroit on Monday. The candidate himself campaigned Friday at a factory in Macomb County, the mostly blue-collar suburban sprawl north of Detroit that has been hard-fought in every election for three decades.

  But Michigan's referendum on school vouchers has complicated things. The voucher question has prompted Roman Catholic parishes, which support vouchers because they could bring state aid to parochial schools, to press their members to turn out to vote. Because many Catholics vote Democratic, this could be to Mr. Gore's advantage. And the voucher issue has apparently kept Mr. McCain from campaigning with Mr. Bush in this state.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. McCain won the Michigan Republican primary on Feb. 22 and remains more popular here than either Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush. He supports vouchers. Gov. John Engler, at least the nominal leader of the Bush campaign in Michigan, opposes them. Mr. Bush, fearful of exacerbating the split in Republican ranks that Mr. Engler's stance has opened, has soft-pedaled his own backing for vouchers, describing them as a matter for state decisions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush strategists have been leery of close ties with Mr. McCain here. The senator has made commercials for the voucher proposal, but not for Mr. Bush. He signed up to campaign with Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, in Michigan this week, and with Mr. Bush in Maine, but not in Michigan, though the 650,000 primary voters who backed Mr. McCain could decide who ends up with the state's 18 electoral votes.

  Prof. David Rohde of Michigan State University said the McCain voters' intentions were a puzzle.  Those who voted for him on personality grounds, he theorized, might find Mr. Bush more appealing; those who voted for him because of his backing for campaign finance reform might prefer Mr. Gore, who has promised to back the legislation that Mr. McCain is co-sponsoring.

  This year, no group is too small to be courted. In the second debate, Mr. Bush said pointedly that the United States should be receptive to Arab nations' views in framing its policies in the Middle East, and he also mentioned Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, a prominent Lebanese-American. The Arab-American Political Action Committee and the Arab-American and Chaldean Leadership Council swiftly issued endorsements. Metropolitan Detroit has the nation's largest concentration of Arab-Americans, centered in Dearborn.

  But William Murchison, who retired as a social studies teacher at Warren Mott High School after 31 years, described the choice in less black-and-white terms.

  The gap between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore has narrowed day by day. The more time that passed from the final debate, which was last Tuesday, the more people seemed to like Mr. Gore. Mr. Bush's widest margin was on Wednesday, the first day of the poll.

  By the last two days of the four-day poll, Mr. Gore had a bare edge over Mr. Bush. That movement is another manifestation of how the support for both candidates is fluid -- and how extraordinarily competitive the race is.

  Even with the slight day-to-day upticks for Mr. Gore, there are several signs that Mr. Bush benefited more from the televised debates. Voters surveyed were slightly more likely to say the debates made them feel better about a Bush presidency than a Gore presidency.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Before the first debate, voters said they expected Mr. Gore to win the election. Now, by a slight margin, they expect Mr. Bush to win. More than half of the respondents said Mr. Bush was spending more time explaining what he would do as president than attacking Mr. Gore. Before the first debate, fewer than half said that of the governor.

  Although Mr. Ryan is a Democrat who plans to vote for Mr. Gore, he groused: ''Gore looks like somebody molded out of clay. He's not warm or genuine. Bush might be a friendlier guy and easier to be with, but he either runs out of thoughts or runs out of ways to express them when he's asked a question.''

  Richard Koch, 83, a part-time accountant in Milwaukee, said he was voting for Mr. Bush. But he, too, is not satisfied with the choices.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''My uneasiness comes mostly from the fact that he is not world-wise politically,'' Mr. Koch said of Mr. Bush. ''This includes foreign policy and basic economics, among other things. He doesn't have the background in these things and hasn't indicated that he really knows what he's talking about. The reason I would vote for him is that I don't think much of Gore. He changes his positions to temper the moment.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000

 <textdata>
  Indeed, a thread throughout the poll is that support for Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore seems halfhearted, with 4 in 10 of each man's own supporters saying they had reservations about their candidate. More of Mr. Bush's backers expressed enthusiasm than did Mr. Gore's; about half for Mr. Bush and about 4 in 10 for the vice president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000

 <textdata>
  Voters who were polled said there were significant differences between the men, and that they had more to do with issues than personality. Those who said the principal differences were about personality were three times more likely to say they would vote for Mr. Bush. Those who cited issues were slightly more likely to say they supported Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Forty-eight percent of those questioned said Mr. Bush had more honesty and integrity than most people in public life, compared with 42 percent who said the same of Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As the two nominees fight for an edge, Mr. Bush still holds an advantage among men, while Mr. Gore has one among women. Voters whose household income is less than $50,000 a year prefer Mr. Gore, while those with higher incomes favor Mr. Bush, according to the poll.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The candidates are splitting support from centrist voters. Mr. Bush does significantly better among independent voters than Mr. Gore, but the vice president does much better among moderates. Voters who live in the suburbs are closely divided, though Mr. Gore holds a slight edge.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The findings made clear that voters are uneasy about Mr. Gore as a person. More than half the voters questioned said that in general, Mr. Gore tells people what he thinks they want to hear rather than what he really believes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Gore's weaknesses were seen by voters as Mr. Bush's greatest strengths. Voters surveyed said that Mr. Bush is more of a straight talker than Mr. Gore, and that the governor usually says what he really believes. But voters do not see Mr. Bush to be as caring for the average person as Mr. Gore.. And the governor continues to be dogged by the fact that voters see him as far less ready to handle domestic and international matters.

  ''My uneasiness comes from Al Gore being in the shadows of Bill Clinton,'' said Renita Pearson, 40, a nurse from Birmingham, Ala., who planned to vote for Mr. Gore anyway. ''I just have this feeling that he won't be able to be as charismatic in foreign negotiations as Clinton. When I hear him speak, I kind of get a condescending feel regarding us as Americans. He rarely uses the words 'our' or 'we' when he speaks, to indicate inclusiveness with those he is addressing.''

  Echoing many other respondents, Melvin Greene, 42, a physical therapist from Brunswick, Ga., said: ''I'm planning on voting for Al Gore because basically I think he is the lesser of two evils. George Bush seems to cater to the wealthy.''

  Victoria Saulia, 78, a retired insurance clerk from Brooklyn, N.Y., was not enthusiastic about her candidate, Mr. Bush. ''I don't know if Bush has enough experience for the job,'' she said. ''Just because he's the former president's son doesn't make him a good candidate. I watched the first two debates and I didn't get a magnetic, visionary feeling from him.'' She added: ''I have to vote and I'm a registered Republican. So right now, that's the only reason I'm voting for him.''

  Though Mr. Gore has occasionally used such phrases before, his unabashed moralizing made for a striking departure from his campaign's recent focus on Social Security, tax cuts and economic growth. It continued the delicate blending of political messages and religious themes that has become a hallmark of the campaign by Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. ''I believe that the purpose of life is to glorify God,'' Mr. Gore said in discussing environmental protection, ''and we cannot fulfill that purpose if we are heaping contempt upon God's creation.''

  Mr. Jakes is an African-American, as were most of his congregants today. He has an increasingly influential worldwide ministry, with many white followers as well, and his church's dedication was celebrated today with written messages from President Clinton and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and with a speech by Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Many of Mr. Jakes's followers -- black and white -- are culturally conservative, and the bishop spoke at this year's Republican National Convention. But Mr. Gore, while not delivering an explicitly political speech, made it clear that he was not ceding those voters to Mr. Bush. While there may have been little audience for Mr. Gore's message in Texas, a state that Mr. Bush is heavily favored to win as a native son, today's service will eventually be seen by millions nationwide when it is broadcast on cable television.

In his address to Mr. Jakes's church, Mr. Gore began by asserting that strong family life is ''something more basic than all of our budget debates but somehow harder to achieve.''

  For much of the remainder of this exceedingly tight campaign, Mr. Gore is likely to keep breakneck schedules like today's, his strategists said. Among the notable stops this week are two in Mr. Gore's home state of Tennessee, where some polls show that Mr. Bush is competitive, and in the traditional Democratic strongholds of West Virginia and Wisconsin. Clearly, the Gore camp would have liked to have put those states in their column by now.

  Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said the Democratic nominee would keep the focus on issues by delivering speeches on major themes like the role of government, education, the Internet economy, energy and the environment, tax cuts, and health care. In keeping with the campaign's frequent use of ''real people,'' Mr. Gore also will lead a series of kitchen-table discussions with parents, students and workers in their homes, Mr. Lehane said.

  As Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.

  Ralph Nader's speech on Feb. 21 declaring his sure-thing quest for the Green Party's nomination was an angry, principled and coherent condemnation of the current state of American politics. Although his anger sometimes swerves into petulance and his principles into dogmatism, his speech presented a stark and provocative contrast to those of the Republican and Democratic candidates, who sounded as if they had the same pollsters. In their June 1999 announcements, Gore and Bush emphasized exactly the same themes: opposing drugs in schools, involving religious organizations in social welfare programs, promoting foreign trade and using prosperity to help the American family.

  This speech is the most compelling contemporary document in ''The Ralph Nader Reader,'' a collection of articles and speeches that span his career before, during and after the years when he had more influence on his country than Al Gore and George W. Bush have had, combined. But it pales in comparison with the best of Nader's earlier writings. ''The Safe Car You Can't Buy'' (1959), '' 'Brown Lung': The Cotton-Mill Killer'' (1971) and the essential ''Remarks Before the Conference on Property Tax Reform'' (1970) have the details of the problems and the urgency and specifics of suggested solutions that made him the scourge of big business until the late 1970's.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Whatever Gore may have done to keep business happy with him -- and despite his recent attacks on the drug and oil industries, he has done quite well at the Wall Street trough -- he has hardly been a corporate welfare recipient of the sort Nader condemned in these words: ''Local governments are anteing up three, four, five hundred million dollars to lure very profitable baseball, football and basketball sports moguls who don't want to share the profits. Corporate sports are being subsidized by cities.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  That is, on the other hand, a fair description of how the Texas Rangers got a new ballpark out of the city of Arlington when George W. Bush owned the team. Unless its $135 million price tag puts it below Nader's threshold. Then there is one of Bush's proudest boasts about his first year as governor, the 1995 passage of tort reform legislation, an idea Gore does not support. That same year, Nader was writing about comparable legislation pending in Congress, warning that ''if the wrongdoers' lobby prevails, the local control that judges and juries have had over wrongdoers will be severely limited.''

  A VAST CONSPIRACY: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President, by Jeffrey Toobin. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $14.) In this account of how some unanswered questions about an Arkansas land deal led to the Starr report and the impeachment trial of President Clinton, the author argues that the legal system is increasingly supplanting the political system. The result is an ''admirably clear, vigorously written, plain-spoken and common-sensical book,'' Thomas Powers wrote here earlier this year. In Shrub: The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush, by Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Vintage, $8.99), two Texas journalists launch a relentless, if good-natured, broadside against the Republican presidential nominee, primarily taking aim at his record as governor and deal maker. ''It serves as a useful, opinionated brief for the prosecution,'' Peter Applebome said here earlier this year.

  ''Thompson and I set him up on Trebla Erog'' -- Albert Gore spelled backwards -- ''but Al caught on pretty quickly,'' Mr. Ritter said in an interview several months back. It was another reporter, Mr. Ritter explained, who had been taken in. ''But Al made himself the goat. It was funny, funny, but it didn't happen that way. I said to my honey, 'I'm worried. He's just said he invented the Internet and he and Tipper were the models for ''Love Story.'' He ought to be more careful.' ''

  In fact, he is careful, sometimes excruciatingly so. In more than a dozen long interviews for a series of biographical articles over the last six months, Mr. Gore constantly monitored his own storytelling, self-editing as he spoke, trying hard to stick to what he knew to be true. ''Now, this is a family anecdote,'' he'd say, ''that like a lot of family anecdotes I can't really vouch for.''

  Various friends, who allow that he has a habit of exaggerating, have various theories about why: That it's all in the tradition of southern storytelling. Or that it's the legacy of his political parents. His father, Senator Albert Gore, was himself considered a standout exaggerator in his day, even by Mr. Gore and his mother, both of whom have been quoted to that effect.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Or they point to the way Mr. Gore was raised, by parents who always had one eye on his political future. They were improving his resume before he was old enough to have one. When he was six, an item in the Knoxville News-Sentinel had Senator Gore bragging that Little Al had ''out-talked a senator'' when he got his dad to buy him a 98-cent bow and arrow set rather than the 49-cent model the senator had chosen: ''He's a budding politician. There may be another Gore on the way to the political pinnacle. He's just six years old now. But with his experiences to date, who knows what may happen?'' How could Mr. Gore be expected to know what was real and what was hype?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many times in our interviews, Mr. Gore cast his life much as his parents would have, and was protective of them, surely lying more to himself than to me when he said that no, he was never lonely as a kid -- though virtually all his boyhood friends remember he was, terribly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000

 <textdata>
  Still, it is no lie that Mr. Gore has a problem, and a problem of his own making. The public seems to accept -- if not to expect -- politicians to sandpaper the facts a bit when presenting their record.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000

  Not much was made of George W. Bush's misstatement in the most recent debate that all three men tried for the murder of James Byrd, the black man killed in Jasper, Tex., were sentenced to death -- though it seems unlikely that the fact that one got a lesser sentence could have escaped his notice.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000

 <textdata>
  BUT the explanation that best captures the many stories I've heard Mr. Gore tell came from Mike Kopp, who worked for him for years and says that usually, he embellishes in an effort to connect.

  It was an eerie coincidence. On Wednesday night, Al Gore and George W. Bush debated foreign policy for some 40 minutes.

  It was an eerie coincidence. On Wednesday night, Al Gore and George W. Bush debated foreign policy for some 40 minutes. The next day, the tense confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians erupted into virtual open warfare, and in Yemen, the American Navy destroyer Cole was bombed in a terrorist attack that took the lives of 17 sailors.

  Neither George Bush nor Al Gore wants to change that role in any kind of real way -- but they, and we as a country, have failed to address its repercussions. Instead, in this presidential campaign, we have focused on essentially rhetorical differences.

  In the debate, Mr. Gore presented himself as a committed liberal interventionist in the Woodrow Wilson tradition. He defended the American intervention in Bosnia on humanitarian grounds, and also went on to argue that ''genocide or ethnic cleansing . . . can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest, because I think it's based on our values.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This explanation hardy differed from that of Mr. Bush, who also opposed humanitarian intervention in Rwanda and supported the intervention in Bosnia (because of our interests in NATO). Although he opposed sending troops to Haiti to promote democracy, he supported interventions in Lebanon, Grenada, Panama and the Persian Gulf.

  For all their supposed differences, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush agree more than they disagree. They both believe in a powerful military, in strong alliances held together by America's armed forces, direct economic and political intervention where it serves American interests and the active discouragement of any potential rival power.

  Mr. Bush may have spoken gently during the debate about the virtues of displaying ''humility.'' But what he meant was the humility of the strong, not of the weak. Moreover, both men labored to portray their vision of American foreign policy as good not only for the United States but for the world.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This is true no matter what we do. It is particularly true if the United States more actively pursues what Mr. Gore has referred to as the policy of ''forward engagement'' --  of ''addressing problems early in their development before they become crises.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This is the way the world works, and it does little good, except perhaps for our self-esteem, to proclaim, as Mr. Gore did in the debate that, ''this nation is now looked on by peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what the future could be.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Nor can we realistically be a ''humble nation,'' in Mr. Bush's phrase, in anything but rhetoric if we expect to retain our full power and influence. The suicide bombers in Yemen help remind us that virtue is not its own reward.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Great powers may be admired or emulated, but they are rarely loved. Both George Bush and Al Gore know this, even though they think that voters' tender sensibilities may be offended to hear it. But we and they have to recognize our nation as the great imperial power it has become.

  Once again the United States has been jolted by foreign crises in the midst of a presidential campaign. Indeed, the turmoil in Israel, the deaths of American sailors in Yemen and the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia all serve as reminders that we are not just choosing a chief architect of domestic policy on Nov. 7. We are also choosing a commander in chief and the nation's principal diplomat. Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush expressed substantial agreement in their debate last week on the centrality of America's role in an unstable world. But recent events underscore that variations in approach can be very important in dealing with real-world events.
 </textdata>

  To begin with, the candidates seem to envision different processes. Mr. Bush spoke of a team concept that would rely on seasoned advisers. Mr. Gore would be more inclined to rely on his own instincts and experience. In that context, he argued for a more muscular projection of American influence, including military intervention, in overseas trouble spots. He described himself as a ''hard-liner'' in favor of action during debates over the Balkans among advisers to President Clinton. By contrast, Mr. Bush argued for a more cautious approach, calling for the earliest possible withdrawal of American troops in the Balkans. He warned against using American troops for ''nation-building'' and said that any foreign involvement must be based on a strict definition of vital national interest. He argued quite properly for the importance of having an exit strategy from the outset.

  As a page that has generally been reluctant to endorse military intervention, we like Mr. Bush's cautious attitude. But presidents seldom get to confront neat, well-ordered foreign policy problems. Indeed, with the post-cold-war era, the world is getting messier. The difficulty in foreign policy is not enunciating home principles but applying them in complex situations. The governor said, for example, that the American hemisphere was a region of vital interest but declared without explanation that intervention to restore democracy in Haiti was inappropriate. Surely if America wants to exert leadership in the years ahead, it cannot automatically dismiss peacekeeping and nation-building missions.

  Mr. Gore, in trying to draw distinctions between himself and the less-experienced governor, outlined a more aggressive response to America's role as the sole superpower. He called for engagement overseas to protect American values as well as interests, and to deal with humanitarian crises. He spoke of his views as in line with the Marshall Plan and the establishment of NATO after World War II. We think Mr. Gore is on the right track in trying to define a foreign policy that deals with the increasing prevalence of genocidal conflict. But he offered no assurances on what limits he might place on such involvements. Defining such limits is the essence of presidential leadership.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was right, of course, that such decisions are taken in consultation with allies and advisers. But it is naive to think that presidential decision-making rests on the consensus of experts alone. Sometimes seasoned advisers disagree or err or get bad intelligence. All recent presidents have come to understand the need to cut through what their advisers say, and in some cases disagree with the best of them. Evan Thomas's new biography of Robert Kennedy reminds us of how Central Intelligence Agency officials and others led President  Kennedy and his brother astray on Cuba. President Reagan listened to the best of his cabinet, including Secretary of State George Shultz, who is now advising Mr. Bush, in keeping the marines in Lebanon in 1983, with disastrous consequences. Mr. Clinton has spoken ruefully of his failure to question his advisers vigorously in Somalia and Bosnia early in his term. That is why Americans, in choosing the next president, need to reflect on the temperament and experience of the man seeking the office and not simply on his assurances that he will bring the best advisers into the White House with him.

 <textdata>
  It is easy to imagine the Bush inner circle, always reliving the glory days of Desert Storm, swinging into action on the strategy of another Middle East war. You know Poppy is peppering his son with e-mails like ''Talk to Condi. Get with Wolfowitz. Very tricky. Water's edge. Nation with one voice.''

  If W., who has been winging it on foreign affairs, had given a shakier debate performance Wednesday, the race might be over. With the scary backdrop of the Middle East, Al Gore could have jumped ahead as he grimly told Americans he had to leave Iowa's pumpkin-strewn campaign stages to join ''the principals'' of the National Security Council in the situation room.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  But in Winston-Salem, W. was like Peter Pan. You knew there were wires holding him up as he flew Around the World With 80 Coaches. (He had finally figured out what was going on in East Timor.) But the Bush team did a pretty good job of hiding those wires for an hour and a half.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And W. ended up with bonus points from the first debate when it turned out that his suggestions that the Russians be called on to help push out Slobodan Milosevic -- which Mr. Gore haughtily dismissed -- turned out to be what the Clinton administration was already doing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000

 <textdata>
  Gore was reacting to Gore, like the sheriff in ''Blazing Saddles'' who holds a gun to his own head and takes himself hostage. W. seemed almost like a bemused spectator at the vice president's split-personality psychodrama. And since Mr. Gore was afraid to show his smarts and his contempt for W., the pair came across as a couple of regular guys running for student body president.
 </textdata>

  ''It's not worth the risk,'' said Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution who served on the National Security Council under President George Bush. ''Yemen has a bad record, and it's still a place where the government is unable or unwilling to take certain steps against certain terrorist groups. We must become more selective and more wary of who we do normal operations with.''

  Drinking lattes and knitting earth-tone sweaters, the audience listened to former State Senator Catherine Abate, a guest of the Central Brooklyn Independent Democrats, say a vote for Mr. Nader meant a vote for Gov. George W. Bush. Ronnie Dugger, founding editor of The Texas Observer and a former New York Green Party senate candidate, and a guest of the Park Slope Greens and the South Slope Greens, said Vice President Al Gore already had a sure victory in New York, and that a vote for Gore was a vote for corporate oligarchy.

  One of the first salvos came in December 1997, when the committee announced it had started a contest to come up with a slogan for Mr. Gore after he told reporters that the hero and heroine in the novel ''Love Story'' were modeled after him and his wife, Tipper.

  So when Mr. Gore said in an interview with CNN in March 1999 that ''during my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet,'' Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, issued this mocking statement: ''During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the paper clip.''

  ''He has tried to pass himself off as this hardscrabble, homespun central Tennessee farm boy and that is not what he is,'' said Mr. Nicholson, playing off the fact that Mr. Gore had told The Des Moines Register that he had learned to slop hogs and clear land on the family farm. Friends later told reporters that Mr. Gore's father had kept him on a backbreaking work schedule during summers on the family farm.

  The Republicans got help as well from an unexpected source. When the Democratic primary fight became bitter, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey insisted that Mr. Gore had deliberately distorted his policy positions in what he called a ''pattern of misrepresentation.''

  After weeks of seesawing polls, several surveys said the competition nationally and in swing states was too close to call.

  If attention to foreign policy continues to escalate, Mr. Gore could capitalize on his much richer foreign affairs experience and the tendency of Americans to rally behind an administration in a time of crisis. On the other hand, if voters disapprove of how the White House is handling matters of war and peace, they may turn to Mr. Bush. Republicans, after all, are rated in polls as more capable of handling foreign policy.

  Gore campaign officials say they feel enormous pressure because they have less to spend than the Republicans, who are spreading resources in more states.

  ''Because the race is so close, you feel pressure within the campaign to open up, break out,'' said Tad Devine, a Gore strategist. ''You feel pressure from institutions that are supporting you. You feel pressure from individual states to make decisions about scheduling and resource allocation.''

  Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top strategist, said he did not feel such pressure. ''We have the resources and the volunteer enthusiasm to conduct an aggressive air and ground game in all the battleground states and then some,'' he said. Mr. Rove said he did not expect either candidate to break ahead in the polls until the end. ''The people who are left out there, available to both sides, are going to move begrudgingly,'' he said.

  Democrats seemed more distressed than Republicans about their candidate, particularly after the second debate.

  The issue of the uninsured has flared anew with a round of charges and countercharges about the Bush record in Texas. But many health policy experts say that the 42.6 million Americans without health insurance are drawing far less attention now than in previous campaigns.

  Yet for all of the enthusiasm of the adoring crowd, Mr. Nader has not exactly rocked the presidential race, having been stalled for months at about 4 percent in national polls. And in recent weeks, with Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas locked in a stubbornly tight race, Democrats have intensified their appeals to Nader supporters, particularly in swing states.

  People interviewed at the Garden were well aware of the problem: that a vote for Mr. Nader would only help Mr. Bush. Most said that while this made them think harder about their vote, they would still side with Mr. Nader and the Green Party because, as Mr. Nader likes to say, both front-runners are corporate mendicants in favor of the death penalty, globalization and corporate donations, and are thus interchangeable.

  ''I have to live with myself,'' said Jennifer Maslowski, a 29-year-old fine arts appraiser and freelance writer in Manhattan who, though leaning toward Gore earlier this week, was so moved at the rally that she pulled out her cell phone to call her mother in upstate New York and got her to promise to switch to Nader, too. ''My life is not going to change very much if either Bush or Gore are elected,'' Ms. Maslowski said.

  For Chrissy Fiorentini, a 19-year-old student at Columbia, the candidate with the most promise was Bill Bradley, and she worked as a campaign volunteer.

  To listen to Al Gore and George W. Bush, you'd think this election represents a clash between radically different visions of what the federal government will spend money on in the years ahead. Gore seems to want to throw new cash everywhere -- preschools, teacher salaries, personal savings accounts. Bush, by contrast, pledges a government that trusts ''real people,'' not Washington bureaucrats, to do what's best with their money.

  Federal spending, in short, is already so big (and fixed) relative to either man's aspirations that even their boldest proposals merely tinker at the margins. Bush's ''risky'' tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years, for example, comes to roughly 5 percent of projected revenues over that period. Al Gore says he'll mount a ''revolution'' in education with a 3 percent bump in national school spending.
 </textdata>

  Spending hovered between 21 and 23 percent of G.D.P. under presidents Reagan and Bush. Thanks to economic growth and spending restraint, spending has more recently declined to 18.7 percent and is headed toward 16 percent. The least understood fiscal fact of our time is that Clinton was coaxed into balancing the budget downward. If we were still spending at Reagan-Bush levels, government would have roughly $300 billion a year more to play with -- enough for seven new departments of education, say, or a shiny new Pentagon. Instead, after two terms, a ''liberal'' president still can't lift Pell grants back to the value they had in the 1970's, or shake loose a few extra billion to fully fund Head Start.

  So far, we've covered only the government's official spending. Plenty of de facto spending gets done under the guise of tax subsidies, the back door to the A.T.M. Tax breaks for mortgage interest payments and employer-provided health care, for example, come to roughly $150 billion a year. Because tax deductions are worth more to people in higher tax brackets, such policies perversely shower bigger subsidies on citizens the richer they are. These subsidies will quietly rise by another $50 billion over the next five years. ''Elect me,'' the subtitles under both a Bush and Gore stump speech could well read, ''and I'll hike health and housing subsidies for millionaires, while renters and the uninsured fend for themselves.'' As Joe Lieberman might say, ''Is this a great country, or what?''

  For now, however, the federal government is stuck in a holding pattern. If Eliot Ness symbolized the fed in the 1930's and Neil Armstrong in the 1960's, the figures that embody the millennial American state are anonymous. They are the countless clerks in bland offices who this year will process 887 million Medicare claims and 542 million Social Security payments. Right this minute one of them is sitting at a computer tapping away at the keys, and if you close your eyes and use a little imagination, you can hear her clickety-clack blend with the echo from thousands of other federal claims processors across the land, until the mad rhythm of finger against keyboard surges in a crescendo worthy of George Orwell, or at least Rod Serling. This is the sound of your government at the dawn of the 21st century, and there's little that you -- or Al Gore and George W. Bush, for that matter -- are going to do about it.

  The presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, welcomed the news of the Middle East meeting.

  Arkansas, along with Tennessee and Florida, has been one of the states where Mr. Gore is hoping to avoid a Southern shutout, but despite three visits and a barrage of television advertisements, he has not been able to establish a lead here. Although the state has voted Democratic in 26 out of 33 presidential elections, a poll conducted two weeks ago for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette showed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas at 45 percent and Mr. Gore at 43 percent, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

  Tennessee, Mr. Gore's home state to the east, is similarly divided, and to the south in Louisiana, which the Clinton-Gore ticket won handily in 1992 and overwhelmingly in 1996, Mr. Bush has been consistently ahead. A survey late last month by Southern Media and Opinion Research for several Louisiana television stations showed Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore 44 percent to 38 percent among registered, likely voters, with a margin of sampling error of four percentage points.

  In interviews this week, many residents in Arkansas and Louisiana were quite specific in their criticisms of Mr. Gore, repeatedly voicing three themes that are leading them to think seriously about voting for Mr. Bush. Most often cited is the vice president's failure to separate himself from Mr. Clinton's scandals, which remain an open wound to many Arkansans. His support for gun control is unpopular among men here and elsewhere in the South, despite his insistence that he would not affect the rights of hunters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And there is also a widespread if tentatively voiced sense that Mr. Gore's personality is simply not as ''Southern'' as Mr. Bush's, that he lacks the easy backslapping boyishness that is the lubricant of the region's politics.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000

  There were, of course, many Gore supporters at the rally, some of whom voiced enthusiasm for his tax plan and doubts about Mr. Bush's intelligence and ability. Many of them, however, said they would vote Democratic simply because they always had.

  Both candidates are spending an unusual amount of time and money contesting the state's six electoral votes, but Art English, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, said Mr. Bush's five visits -- which included a stop at Central High School, the civil rights shrine -- have been more successful, drawing more media attention and more enthusiastic crowds.

  Vaughn McQuary, chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party, said he believed Mr. Gore would eventually win the state once older voters focused on his Medicare plan, but Mr. McQuary acknowledged that the vice president's stand in favor of greater gun control was hurting him.

  ''The Republicans have done a pretty good job pounding on the gun issue,'' he said. ''Hey, I'm a big duck hunter, and I know Al Gore isn't going to do anything to keep anyone in Arkansas out of a duck blind. But we have to do a better job of communicating that to people, because it's a big issue here.''

  Louisiana, with its heavy dependence on the oil and chemical industries, has not looked favorably on Mr. Gore's environmentalist passions, and many residents consider Mr. Bush a more familiar next-door neighbor, particularly considering his oil background. But Mr. Gore's valedictorian persona could not be more at odds with the raffish personal character that the state's voters have traditionally admired in a politician and enjoyed in Mr. Clinton.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Bernard Pinsonat, who conducted the Southern Media poll, said Mr. Gore is likely to get almost all the black votes in Louisiana, but at this point is supported by only a quarter of white voters. Mr. Clinton, on the other hand, always drew at least 35 percent of the white vote, Mr. Pinsonat said.

  One of those white voters -- Jackie Berthelat, 46, who works in the pharmaceutical industry and was cradling an infant at the Lakeside Mall in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans -- said he was supporting Mr. Bush purely in opposition to Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000

  Mr. Gore spoke first with black ministers, including Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks, former executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Dr. Hooks said that some African-Americans did not know Mr. Gore's record. By way of explaining it, Dr. Hooks, who said he had known the vice president since ''his daddy had him clean out pigsties,'' said, ''His heart is right, his mind is fixed, his spirit is on fire.''

  In his second phone call, which he laced with Spanish phrases, Mr. Gore turned his attention to the ''colonias,'' the poor settlements along the Texas border. Hispanic leaders have criticized Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Gore's Republican rival, for never having visited a colonia, and Mr. Gore highlighted that today.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Gore referred to remarks made Friday by Mr. Bush's secretary of state, Elton Bomer, defending the governor. ''You don't have to go to Alaska to know it's cold,'' Mr. Bomer said, ''and I don't think you have to go to colonias to know what it's like.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said today, ''That is a cold comment in itself,'' and said ''it speaks volumes'' about Texas and the Bush administration.

 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  As if speaking at a rally, Mr. Gore enumerated his priorities: health care and education, protecting Social Security and Medicare, offering middle-class tax cuts, protecting the environment and enforcing civil-rights laws. ''This is time for leadership,'' he said. ''This is time for passion.''

  The campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has all but conceded New Jersey to the Democrats, just the way it gave up on New York and Massachusetts at the beginning of the game, and that means that the Democrats take New Jersey's 15 electoral votes for granted. Mr. Bush has not pleaded for votes in New Jersey since attending a fund-raising event during the summer, and the same goes for the rest of the party heavyweights, who use the state as an ATM but not as a hunting ground for votes.

  Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's vice presidential running mate, was in the state for an appearance recently, of course, and thousands of commuters to the seashore will no doubt go to the polls next month with the memory of Vice President Al Gore shutting down the Garden State Parkway in rush hour so he could get to Jon Bon Jovi's $850,000 fund raiser for him.

  David Rebovich, a political scientist at Rider University, says that New Jersey Republicanism may be in bad odor with the rest of the party. Although it has a Republican governor and a Republican-controlled statehouse, the state's Republican Party is distinctly liberal by, say, Texas standards, and it got a black eye in the Iowa Republican debates last year when the conservative Gary L. Bauer, otherwise forgotten, demanded that Mr. Bush promise to never, ever pick Governor Whitman as a running mate.
 </textdata>

  ''George Bush didn't write off New Jersey,'' Mr. Bodman said. ''He wrote off New York and the New York media market. When you have a limited amount of money, $68 million or whatever it is, it comes down to a fiscal decision.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And any decision to buy expensive New York television advertising to reach New Jerseyans alone went out the window when Mr. Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, thereby undercutting the Bush's ancestral ties to Connecticut and making any media campaigns there pointless.

 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Mr. Lehane's comments are a mark of Al Gore's weak leadership at a time when his campaign is struggling,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''The crisis in the Middle East should not prevent our nation from discussing the implications of this administration's failure to have an energy policy. Governor Bush will continue to credit the administration in its efforts to stop the violence in the Middle East, but he will not hesitate to critique the administration's failed energy policies.''

Mr. Bush, who was in Texas preparing for Tuesday's debate, issued a statement after President Clinton announced a summit on Monday in Egypt: ''I welcome this development.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush introduced that term into the campaign when he used it repeatedly to criticize Mr. Gore in their first debate. Today, Mr. Gore appropriated the phrase, even as he argued that the differences between him and Mr. Bush were more about priorities than numbers.

  Speaking to a crowd dominated by union members and African-Americans, Mr. Gore charged that Mr. Bush has failed to explain how he would pay for his proposal to allow workers to invest part of their Social Security deductions in the stock market, at an estimated cost of $1 trillion. That plan would eventually bankrupt the system, Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000

  He also used a study released this week by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, to assert that Mr. Bush had been wrong when he said in Wednesday's debate that ''the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''What I believe I heard last week was him saying the uninsured population in America went up and the uninsured population in Texas went down,'' Mr. Gore said of Mr. Bush. ''But what the figures seem to show is exactly the reverse. Now what is the phrase that describes that kind of calculation?''

  In May, as he bickered with Gov. George W. Bush over the wisdom of allowing individuals to invest portions of their Social Security withholding taxes, Vice President Al Gore made a startling admission: he hadn't made a single dollar from the bull market. In fact, Gore explained, to avoid any conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, he didn't even own stock, and hadn't since 1976, when he first joined Congress. The man fighting for ultimate stewardship of American fiscal policy had taken a pass on the greatest investment opportunity of our time in favor of an interest-bearing checking account.

  The vice president clearly expected that the news would inspire confidence; instead, it inspired Fortune magazine to suggest he could be ''a financial dolt.'' In this era of skyrocketing returns, what inspires confidence is the knowledge that an enormous chunk of your personal wealth derives from securities, especially those in the risky but potentially lucrative technology sector. Stock-market savvy has saturated every corner of society. (Liberty Financial now markets a special mutual fund to clients as young as 11.) By opting out, Gore lost serious street cred -- or at least Wall Street cred.

  Eisenhower gained an almost immediate benefit, said David Bushman, curator of the museum's package of screenings. In 1948, each presidential candidate trekked up to 30,000 miles to shake half a million hands; Eisenhower's commercials were sent out to 19 million television sets across the country and sealed his victory, Mr. Bushman said. Eisenhower's Democratic opponent, Adlai E. Stevenson, refused to appear in television advertisements, saying they showed contempt for the American people and proclaiming, ''This isn't Ivory Soap versus Palmolive.''

  One of the most notorious presidential campaign advertisements appeared in 1988, when supporters of the Republican candidate, George Bush, broadcast a photograph of Willie Horton, a menacing-looking black man who had been imprisoned for murder and rape and then released on a prison furlough program in Massachusetts initiated by Mr. Bush's opponent, Michael S. Dukakis, the state's governor. Playing on racial fears, the ''revolving door'' ad helped make 1988, in the opinion of many, the nadir of political TV advertising.

  Largely in reaction, a greater scrutiny of political ads began with the 1992 campaign, as newspapers began to examine their truthfulness and balance. The resulting ''ad watches,'' combined with voters' increased disgust with attack ads, has resulted in cleaner, more issue-oriented ads today, Ms. Jamieson said. When Gov. George W. Bush's campaign released a commercial earlier this year ridiculing Vice President Al Gore and referring to his fund-raising visit to a Buddhist temple, it was criticized by many officials in Mr. Bush's own party.

  The issue of the uninsured has flared anew in the presidential campaign, with a fierce exchange in the last debate and a new round of charges and countercharges about the Bush record in Texas. But many health policy experts say that at least so far, the 42.6 million Americans without health insurance have drawn far less attention in this campaign than the experts would have  hoped, given the budget surplus and the booming economy.

  Both candidates have offered proposals to expand coverage, but neither plan is on the scale proposed by their counterparts in 1992, Bill Clinton and President Bush. Governor Bush's proposal to use tax credits to help people buy private insurance ''is simply dwarfed by his father's plan,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, an expert on health policy at Princeton.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Gore would expand the existing Children's Health Insurance Program to ensure that all children have access to affordable coverage by 2005, a popular goal that gets high marks from health advocacy groups. But it also falls well short of the goal of health care for all, or universal coverage, that his party insisted on in 1992.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, for example, recently asserted that Mr. Gore ''likes Hillary-Care,'' adding, ''He wants to nationalize the health care system of America.'' (Not exactly. Contrary to Republican dogma, the exceedingly complicated Clinton plan would not have nationalized the health care system; it would have required employers to provide insurance and created regulatory structures to oversee benefits and premiums.)
 </textdata>

  Senator Bill Bradley's failed effort to build his Democratic presidential campaign around the cause of universal coverage also probably had a chilling effect, several analysts said.  Throughout the fall and winter last year, Mr. Gore picked apart the Bradley plan as unwieldy and unworkable.

  Dr. Gail Wilensky, a health adviser to Governor Bush and a top health official in his father's administration, said: ''Right before an election is a hard time to know where you are.  But potentially, come February or March, we may be able to make a move. And what we've clearly learned in the last eight years is that prosperity alone is not going to make this problem go away.''

  The two candidates' proposals reflect their different philosophical approaches. Mr. Bush would use refundable tax credits -- up to $2,000 for families and $1,000 for individuals -- to help low- and moderate-income families buy health insurance on the private market. The full tax credit would be available to families with incomes up to $30,000 and would gradually phase out at higher incomes, with a cutoff at $60,000. Mr. Bush would also provide $8 billion in additional money over 10 years to  community health centers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The main criticism of Mr. Bush's plan is that the tax credits are too small. ''He's offering $1,000 for an individual policy that on average costs $2,000, and $2,000 for a family policy that on average costs $6,000,'' said Dr. Judith Feder, dean of policy studies at Georgetown University, and a former top health adviser in the Clinton Administration. For a family making $30,000 or less, Dr. Feder argued, that's the equivalent of ''giving a 10-foot rope to people in a 30-foot hole.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore would expand eligibility for the Children's Health Insurance Program to cover all children in families with incomes up to about $42,000; children in families with higher incomes, whose parents did not have coverage through their employers, would be allowed to buy into the program, with the help of a new federal tax credit. That credit, 25 percent of the health insurance premium, would be aimed at middle-income people who had to buy insurance on their own. Moreover, the children's program would be expanded to cover uninsured low-income parents.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore is proposing to spend more money on expanding coverage -- his campaign puts the price tag at $146 billion over 10 years, to Mr. Bush's $75.1 billion in the same time period -- and his focus on children and their parents has earned praise from advocacy groups.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-15-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But several health care experts said that a more notable step would be to combine the Bush and Gore proposals. ''I think there's a possibility of a real compromise after the election,'' Mr. Butler said, with conservatives willing to accept some expansion of the children's program  and liberals willing to accept a greater use of tax credits for more moderate income people.

  ON THE SCREEN -- Opens with a white screen and the words ''Whose economic plan is best for you?'' Then flashes to a screen with a chart labeled ''Bush: Tax Cut Plan,'' showing how people at various income levels would do under Mr. Bush's proposal. Next comes a chart comparing the spending proposals made by President Clinton with those made by Mr. Gore. Concludes with text on a white screen saying that Mr. Gore's plan would undermine the economy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  THE SCRIPT -- Announcer: ''Whose economic plan is best for you? Under George Bush's plan, a family earning under $35,000 a year pays no federal income taxes, a 100 percent tax cut. Earn $35-50,000? A 55 percent tax cut. And Al Gore's plan? Three times the new spending President Clinton proposed, so much it wipes out the entire surplus and creates a deficit again. Al Gore's deficit spending plan threatens America's prosperity.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ACCURACY -- The chart describing the effects of the Bush tax plan is somewhat misleading. Many families making less than $35,000 a year already pay no federal income taxes. Mr. Bush's plan would remove more of them from the income tax rolls, mainly by doubling the child credit. But the claims in the commercial are based on a family with two children; single people and families with fewer than two children would not fare as well.

  The assertion that Mr. Gore is proposing three times the spending sought by Mr. Clinton is based on a comparison of the 1992 Clinton campaign's agenda with Mr. Gore's proposals this year. Mr. Clinton made his proposals at a time when the government was running a record budget deficit and was constrained from expanding or adding programs. Mr. Gore is proposing ways to allocate a large and growing surplus. The comparison is based on a study by the National Taxpayer's Union, a conservative research group, which says Mr. Gore's spending plans total $2.9 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Gore puts the number at between $870 billion and $1 trillion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  SCORE CARD -- Mr. Bush has sought to frame the debate as one about who would best take advantage of the nation's prosperity, rather than about who gets the credit for it. The new advertising is intended to suggest that Mr. Gore is an old-style tax-and-spend liberal who will squander the surplus, while emphasizing that Mr. Bush is giving a tax break to lower and middle income families. But the more that Mr. Bush pushes economic issues, the more he risks reminding voters that the country has rarely, if ever, had it this good.

That is such an equivocal judgment that it may prove tentative. It may well remain open to major revision almost until Election Day, now less than four weeks off.

  ''I thought Bush did very well,'' Professor Jones said. ''There's no longer any stature gap between the two of them. I also thought Bush looked more presidential tonight.  What he had to do was show command, and he did it. As he said, the presidency is not just the president; it's a team, and I was very impressed by how well Governor Bush's team has prepared him on foreign policy, how well he absorbed it and how skillfully he used it. He did that as well on several of the complicated domestic issues.''

Some that exist were not brought out, like affirmative action, where they're on diametrically opposed sides. But both appear to have done what they had to do. Bush was quite articulate on foreign affairs -- he named names, he discussed policies -- and the vice president was friendlier, less condescending.''

  It was not so much that the nominees backed away from previous policy divergences; they made their differences on health care and gun control just as clear as in the past.

But for the most part they cloaked their differences in polite language.

  ''Bush fought him to a draw,'' said Prof. Kenneth Goldstein. ''He didn't get blown away on foreign policy, not at all, which I thought he would.  That's bad for Gore. Bush mangled a few verbs and a few ideas. But it comes down in the end to who you think this election is about, and for whatever reason, it's about Al Gore.  He has to connect. But he hasn't, and it's not enough just to show that he would have won a debate when they were in high school.''

  ''Gore's handlers got him to sit back and relax,'' Professor Sapiro said.

  But Mr. Bush later discussed the Middle East in some detail, showing a surer hold on specifics than he did in talking about foreign affairs last week. Mr. Gore, for his part, refrained from the superciliousness that he had exhibited as Mr. Bush dealt with the several subjects last week. That had grated on many voters. Both men were careful not to slam the other's point of view, something that the voters dislike; indeed, they sounded courtly at times.

  Almost 40 uninterrupted minutes were devoted to foreign policy, much more than in any other presidential debate in the last few electoral campaigns.

  Like two students dutifully taking a makeup exam, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush tried earnestly and politely last night in their second debate to make a better impression on Americans than they did the first time. Their goals were obvious. Mr. Bush wanted to look smarter, and Mr. Gore, chastened by criticism over the last week, wanted to be less off-putting. Both succeeded, but at first blush the Texan may have gained more from the kinder, gentler atmosphere. Mr. Bush thrived in the low-intensity environment, appearing markedly more confident and sure-footed than he had in the past. But Mr. Gore could get a payoff in the days ahead. He had clearly made a bet that by abandoning his bullying tactics of the first debate, he might gain in the long run with voters inclined toward him on issues but troubled by his officious manner.

His cautious approach gave Mr. Gore a chance to promote his more muscular, interventionist view to deal with genocide and other humanitarian crises.

  The exchanges came in a relatively informal setting at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. Mr. Bush had sought a more casual venue as a better showcase for his personal charm, and indeed he seemed to grow in confidence as the debate wore on. ''Seems like we're having a great love fest here tonight,'' he remarked, almost as if amused at the way Mr. Gore seemed to be on good behavior -- ''defanged,'' as some commentators put it. The vice president, conscious of the need to avoid being overbearing or committing trivial errors, at times did not look like his normal self, and it changed the chemistry of the encounter. Only at the end did he address the subject explicitly. Mr. Bush, in answer to a question about his opponent's credibility, repeated the charge that Mr. Gore had engaged in exaggerations and falsehoods. The vice president parried the accusation, acknowledging that he had gotten ''some of the details'' wrong about a student's having to stand for lack of desks but that his larger contention about overcrowded classrooms remained correct. As to the overarching question of his reliability, Mr. Gore insisted that even if he got details wrong, ''if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.''

  The shift of emphasis toward more discussion of foreign policy issues was obviously dictated by events. Except for a general criticism that the Clinton administration had been too quick to intervene in Haiti and other places, Mr. Bush did not level major criticisms at Mr. Gore. He noted, however, that the coalition against Saddam Hussein of Iraq had unraveled since the end of the gulf war, prompting Mr. Gore to observe dryly that it was the administration of President Bush, the governor's father, that had left Mr. Hussein in power.

  The candidates' polite demeanor lifted somewhat when they sparred over health care and the environment. Mr. Gore charged that Texas was either 49th or 50th in extending health care to uninsured women and children, failing to take advantage of the federal child health insurance program. Noting the governor's claims to be compassionate, the vice president sharply declared that he was not challenging Mr. Bush's ''heart'' so much as his priorities. Mr. Bush fired back that on the Clinton-Gore watch the number of uninsured Americans had increased, and that the vice president ''can make any excuse he wants.''

  The debate occurred at a moment of almost exquisite closeness in the presidential contest. Several recent polls have shown Mr. Bush slightly ahead of Mr. Gore, his best showing since before the Democratic convention in Los Angeles in August. A lot will depend on the public's final impressions of the debate last night, rather than on the flash polls and post-debate spin. Last week many voters thought Mr. Gore had ''won'' on substance but lost on style. The underlying truth is that while most Americans have made up their minds about the candidates and their positions, enough voters are uncertain about the measure of these two men to keep the race unpredictable. It may stay that way until the very end.

  Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas played a central role in tonight's presidential debate as the governor and Vice President Al Gore clashed over the state's problem of uninsured residents, its environment and a hate crimes bill that failed to pass the State Legislature in 1999.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore, who has criticized Mr. Bush's record in Texas on and off for months, prompted the most heated exchange when he cited statistics that rank the state at the bottom or near it in several national health indexes, including having 1.4 million uninsured children, among them about 600,000 who are eligible for Medicaid but are not yet enrolled in it. Mr. Gore said Texas ranked 49th in the number of uninsured women and children.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked by the moderator, Jim Lehrer, whether Mr. Gore's statistics were inaccurate, Mr. Bush did not directly respond, instead emphasizing his administration's recent enrollment of roughly 110,000 uninsured children in the federal Child Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and its overall spending of $4.7 billion on the uninsured in Texas. Mr. Bush also said that the percentage of uninsured Texans compared with the state's total population had gone down while the percentage of uninsured Americans had risen.

  These problems, of course, predate Mr. Bush and can be traced to a host of causes, including the state's historic poverty levels, particularly along the border with Mexico.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush's administration has been criticized as failing to do enough to address health concerns. During the 1999 legislative session, Mr. Bush lobbied to limit the coverage levels for the federal CHIP program to children with family incomes of 150 percent of the poverty line, though the federal law allowed coverage of up to 200 percent of poverty. Ultimately, the lawmakers approved the higher level, thereby providing coverage for 200,000 children who would have been excluded under Mr. Bush's proposal. The governor signed the bill into law.

  On the environment, Mr. Gore noted that Houston has ''just become the smoggiest city in the country, and Texas is No. 1 in industrial pollution.'' Mr. Bush countered that while Texas is ''a big industrial state,'' it had reduced its industrial waste by 11 percent since he took office in 1995. He also noted that the state had cleaned up 450 formerly polluted industrial sites since then.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush referred to a 1999 electric deregulation law that included a stipulation that utilities must make mandatory reduction in their emissions of nitrogen oxide, one of the building blocks of smog. Mr. Bush signed this bill, but his emphasis during that session was another bill that created a voluntary program to bring outdated petrochemical plants into compliance. These plants, more so than utilities, are the state's leading industrial polluters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Environmentalists have criticized this law as ineffective, and one group reported this month that it had amounted to reductions of less than 1 percent of emissions since 1999. Mr. Bush has argued that the cuts are greater.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000

  Mr. Gore criticized Mr. Bush for not supporting an expanded and toughened hate crimes bill before the Texas Legislature last year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush replied, ''We're happy with our laws on the books.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000

 <textdata>
  The measure to which Mr. Gore referred, the most contentious issue  before the Legislature in 1999, was named after James Byrd Jr., the black man who was dragged to death in Jasper, Tex., a year earlier.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush never said during the legislative session whether he would have signed the proposed legislation, but he did not push for its adoption.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  In the debate tonight, Mr. Bush declared that the three men convicted of killing Mr. Byrd had been sentenced to death. In fact, two received the death penalty and one was sentenced to life in prison.

  As a practical matter, the fate of the rules may rest with the outcome of the national election. While neither Vice President Al Gore nor Gov. George W. Bush has outlined his views on the rules, the issue has split largely along party lines.

  ONE of the few things that Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush agree on is that elderly citizens should have government-subsidized prescription drug insurance. The Gore plan is much more generous and gives more details than the Bush plan, but both proposals deviate from the ideal model of economic insurance. The reasons reveal as much about politics as they do about economics.

The Gore plan is much more generous and gives more details than the Bush plan, but both proposals deviate from the ideal model of economic insurance. The reasons reveal as much about politics as they do about economics.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So the candidates have devised voluntary plans that offer subsidized premiums to entice people to buy coverage. Mr. Gore would subsidize half the premium and Mr. Bush 25 percent. Many experts question whether Mr. Bush's subsidy is sufficiently generous to attract enough people to avoid crippling adverse selection problems.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Why tilt benefits to the front end and put the deductible in the middle? To attract enough older people -- who do not always act rationally when it comes to insurance -- and thereby skirt the problem of adverse selection. Almost everyone receives some reimbursement under the Gore plan because more than 85 percent of older people take at least one prescription drug annually. The politics are such that ''the principle of making sure the median participant would benefit mattered more than the principles of optimal insurance,'' said Mark McClellan, a professor of economics and medicine at Stanford University who worked on the Clinton-Gore plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush would initially hand off drug insurance for the poor elderly to the states -- a responsibility many governors don't want. (For a candidate running against ''big government,'' this approach has the curious effect of creating 50 government bureaucracies.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Most elderly people who lack insurance have incomes above 150 percent of the poverty line, so they would be unaffected by this part of the plan anyway. Mr. Bush said he would form a White House task force to devise a proposal that relies on private insurance plans, a government plan and H.M.O.'s to cover all the elderly. The voluntary sorting of the elderly with high expenses into the most generous plans would probably cause this market to eventually unravel.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also said he would seek catastrophic coverage for all out-of-pocket Medicare costs, including drugs, in excess of $6,000 a year, paid for by unspecified cuts elsewhere in Medicare. Although the instinct to provide catastrophic coverage is a good one, it is doubtful enough could be cut from Medicare to finance it. ''An elderly person cannot possibly know what situation they would be in if Bush won and got his current ideas passed into law,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Bismarck, the father of social insurance, was fond of paraphrasing Voltaire: the best should not be the enemy of the good. The Gore plan is very expensive but it would provide protection against escalating prescription drug costs and solve adverse-selection problems; the Bush plan is less expensive but probably unworkable. In this case, the best would be for the elderly to recognize that the goal of insurance is to provide a cushion against unexpected catastrophes, not a regular check for anticipated expenses.

  For the better part of a year now, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have gingerly stepped around much detailed discussion of how America should exercise its unchallenged economic, diplomatic and military power around the world.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore portrayed himself as the interventionist Democrat, the man who would be driven largely by ''a question of values'' and who would consider an act of genocide enough of a challenge to American interests to consider sending troops abroad. He stopped short, however, of saying the Clinton administration should have done so to stop the genocide in Rwanda six years ago.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was the reluctant internationalist, the man who allowed that ''we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade'' and then insisted that America should keeps its troops out of Africa and Haiti, or anyplace else where the mission sniffed of ''nation-building.'' He never defined that phrase, but he made clear that he thought the purpose of the American military was to fight wars, not rebuild countries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And in Mr. Bush's world view, America's traditional allies mattered far more than remote, poor or strategically inconsequential nations. ''There's got to be priorities,'' he said, ticking off the Middle East, Europe, the Far East and ''our own hemisphere,'' a list that conspicuously omitted Africa and many of the world's poorest nations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say, 'This is the way it's got to be,' '' Mr. Bush said, sounding much like the Democrats sounded in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Later he added, ''I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country, say, ' We do it this way; so should you.' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That left Mr. Gore free to sound more like the Republicans of two decades ago -- certain that America's role is to make others in the world exercise their long-suppressed desire to ''be like us more.'' He described himself, as he did in an interview last week, as a nation-builder and proud of it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Once again, he invoked President Harry S. Truman's use of the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, seeming to suggest that it was the kind of role Mr. Bush would have opposed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We were nation-building,'' Mr. Gore said. ''And it was economic, but it was also military.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Pressed by the moderator, Jim Lehrer, about when they would have committed troops and when they would have backed off, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush politely quibbled. But these  were quibbles with a deeper message that suggested significantly different standards of when American intervention makes sense.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Lebanon, where American marines died in a huge car-bomb blast? ''I thought that was a mistake,'' Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Grenada, where President Ronald Reagan, in the name of saving American medical students, made a clumsy but successful stand against a tiny government that seemed to be defying American wishes and influence? ''I supported that,'' he said, along with the Bush administration's ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's dictator. But he had second thoughts about Somalia, a decision of ''the Bush-Quayle administration,'' he said, unable to avoid reference to one of the Republican Party's less admired vice presidents.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, treading carefully, had problems with Somalia, too, not the mission his father began but the one President Clinton finished.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Later, pressed about where he might pull back American forces, which he said were overcommitted, Mr. Bush had a hard time. He would keep them in Korea, he said, and in Europe. But he also said he would hand off peacekeeping to other, regional players; he cited Australia's role last year in East Timor as a superb example of where someone else provided the troops while the Pentagon gave advice and a bit of logistical help. He said he would like to withdraw American troops from the Balkans, but not immediately. The only place he named from which he would withdraw troops at once was Haiti, where there are only a handful.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000

 <textdata>
  Governor Bush may have left viewers with the incorrect impression that the United States is alone in maintaining ground troops to keep the peace in Bosnia and Kosovo.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The dynamic of the interventionist Mr. Gore and the more reluctant Mr. Bush also played out beyond the military realm.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As on other foreign policy issues, the two men gingerly approached the question of when America should put up its own money, or the International Monetary Fund's, to stop financial crises. Here, Mr. Bush was more specific.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet that is exactly what the I.M.F. and the United States Treasury did in Mexico, an intervention that was supported by Mr. Bush, whose home state, Texas, would have borne the brunt of a more severe Mexican economic collapse.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Without noting that Mr. Gore had been the architect of much of the Clinton administration's Russia policy, Mr. Bush charged that the administration had blindly lent to corrupt regimes. ''We went into Russia,'' he said. ''We said, 'Here's some I.M.F. money,'  and it ended up in Viktor Chernomyrdin's pocket.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was clearly on the defensive, and said he was uncomfortable with the I.M.F. ''I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable,'' he said, without giving specifics.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush chose not to answer, at least directly.

  Good evening Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. At the end of our 90 minutes last week in Boston, the total time each of you took was virtually the same. Let's see if we can do the same tonight, or come close.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush, the first question goes to you. One of you is about to be elected the leader of the single most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE -- Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration it was right after I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf war resolution. And at the end of that war, for whatever reasons, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power. I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein. And I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it. But that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia. And you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week. And it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the Communist bloc, it seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governor's not necessarily saying that, but you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three, where they notified. And they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it. I don't think they should be allowed to.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE -- Well, of course, in that, again -- no, I think that that was ill considered. I did support it at the time. It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we, that we should take, take very, very seriously.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- And Bosnia and you've already talked about Kosovo. But the reverse side of the question, governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, for instance, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994. There was no U.S. intervention, there was no intervention from the outside world. Was that a mistake not to intervene?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Let me put that directly to you, Vice President Gore. The reason you brought this up is that, are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way Governor Bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. BUSH -- A brownfield is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers. And people that are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of law suit. I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. Book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing, big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment. And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Last question for you, governor, and this flows somewhat out of the Boston debate. You, your running mate, your campaign officials have charged that Vice President Gore exaggerates, embellishes and stretches the facts, etc. Are you -- do you believe these are serious issues, this is a serious issue that the voters should use in deciding which one of you two men to vote for on Nov. 7?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. BUSH -- Well, we all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself, you know. But you know what I mean. I think credibility is important. It's going to be important to be -- for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations. And, yes, I think it's something that people need to consider. This -- this isn't something new. I read a report or a memo from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then-Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims. And, you know, I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley, saying he altered the E.I.T.C. when it didn't happen. I mentioned the last --
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE -- Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important. This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people. And education is my No. 1 priority because I think that it's the most important big, major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.

But that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia. And you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week. And it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the Communist bloc, it seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governor's not necessarily saying that, but you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three, where they notified. And they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it. I don't think they should be allowed to.

  MR. GORE -- Well, of course, in that, again -- no, I think that that was ill considered. I did support it at the time. It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we, that we should take, take very, very seriously.

 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- And Bosnia and you've already talked about Kosovo. But the reverse side of the question, governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, for instance, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994. There was no U.S. intervention, there was no intervention from the outside world. Was that a mistake not to intervene?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Let me put that directly to you, Vice President Gore. The reason you brought this up is that, are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way Governor Bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000

  MR. BUSH -- A brownfield is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers. And people that are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of law suit. I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. Book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing, big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment. And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000

 <textdata>
  MR. LEHRER -- Last question for you, governor, and this flows somewhat out of the Boston debate. You, your running mate, your campaign officials have charged that Vice President Gore exaggerates, embellishes and stretches the facts, etc. Are you -- do you believe these are serious issues, this is a serious issue that the voters should use in deciding which one of you two men to vote for on Nov. 7?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. BUSH -- Well, we all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself, you know. But you know what I mean. I think credibility is important. It's going to be important to be -- for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations. And, yes, I think it's something that people need to consider. This -- this isn't something new. I read a report or a memo from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then-Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims. And, you know, I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley, saying he altered the E.I.T.C. when it didn't happen. I mentioned the last --
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE -- Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important. This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people. And education is my No. 1 priority because I think that it's the most important big, major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.
 </textdata>

  MR. LEHRER -- Governor Bush, two minutes.
 </textdata>

  Thank you Vice President Gore, Governor Bush. See you next week.

  Most riveting is the voice of the warden, simply because of his position. When Gov. George W. Bush's office calls Huntsville and authorizes that day's execution, it is the warden who goes to the cell and says, ''It's time.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Almost every boast was qualified, every criticism carefully tempered. After saying that people all around the world admired the United States, Mr. Gore quickly added, ''I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans; it's really true.''

 <textdata>
  Before hitting Gov. George W. Bush with statistics that denigrated his record in Texas, he looked and sounded pained and self-effacing, as if he wished he did not have to do this and could only hope he was getting it right.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Across the table, Mr. Bush was rummaging through a trove of big words. He talked about not letting the American military ''atrophy.'' He expressed concern over any ''abrogation'' of agreements with allies. And he found something ''egregious''  twice in about five minutes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He also went through a roll call of Middle Eastern countries, naming ''Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait.'' With geographic chops like these, Mr. Bush seemed to be asking voters, how could anyone doubt his capacity for world leadership? Mr. Bush even mentioned Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former prime minister of Russia, without having to, and managed to pronounce his name correctly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For all the serious talk about serious issues, what the candidates engaged in tonight was largely an exercise in image repair and image improvement. Mr. Gore sought a softer, warmer, more truthful touch.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush sought an aura of comfort, not distress, with all the complicated information a president must, or at least should, master. Answering questions from the moderator, Jim Lehrer, about foreign policy, Mr. Bush adopted a tone so calm, content and convivial he might have been reminiscing with a grandmother about favorite holiday memories.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At last week's debate, because of  an unfortunate makeup error, Mr. Gore had sported an orange complexion. But tonight, it was replaced by a more appropriate, life-like hue.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He was obviously eager to shed his reputation in some quarters as a bully, so he repeatedly prefaced efforts to box Mr. Bush into various corners with apologetic caveats like: ''Maybe I heard the previous statements wrong, governor.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He was just as obviously intent on not monopolizing the speaking time, so Mr. Gore responded to a suggestion from Mr. Lehrer that another rebuttal yield to a new topic of debate by chirping: ''Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He even offered a frank, forthright apology for his factual errors from a week ago, complete with an almost hangdog stutter. ''I -- I'm sorry about that,'' Mr. Gore said. ''And I -- I -- I'm going to try to do better.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And the sigh master was gone, allowing a different purveyor of awkward nonverbal utterances to emerge. Enter Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush seemed to have a cold, and his failure at times to suppress his sniffles and snorts was perhaps an unintended byproduct of what he was trying to accomplish. He clearly wanted to seem so utterly comfortable with the thrust and parry that his demeanor banished any sense among voters that he might be out of his depth. He was also aiming for notes of naturalness that Mr. Gore could only fantasize about.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As for seriousness, the Texas governor's effort to convey that began when he first sat down. There was a pen and several sheets of paper in front of him, and he conspicuously scribbled faster and longer than Mr. Gore, who was undoubtedly happy to let Mr. Bush one-up him in this department.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  An exchange with Mr. Lehrer toward the end was the clearest indication of Mr. Bush's agenda.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush made reference to the initials ''E.I.T.C.,'' prompting a request from Mr. Lehrer that he explain the reference.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Earned income tax credit,'' Mr. Bush said, subsequently adding, in a self-satisfied vein: ''A lot of initials for a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore made little, mincing shows of respect for each other.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It seems like we're having a great love-fest tonight,'' Mr. Bush remarked at one point, an assessment with which Mr. Lehrer seemed to agree. He was forced, time and again, to ask the candidates if they might take the time and trouble to specify what their differences were, because they were so often sounding so much alike.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But there was acid just under the surface, and it occasionally bubbled up. Mr. Gore made a point of referring to the ''Bush-Quayle'' administration, cunningly evoking with that second name a politician, like the Texas governor, who was ridiculed for his verbal unsteadiness.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush just so happened to evoke ''Mrs. Clinton,'' circa 1993, when she was pressing a health plan that included more federal control than most Americans wanted. He tied Mr. Gore to her, and the careful viewer could sense the barely suppressed chortle as he did so. Mr. Gore stared back at Mr. Bush icily.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But he did not respond with a sigh, and he did not lapse into a lecture, and he did not even seize this dastardly claim of Mr. Bush's as an excuse to ask for more speaking time.
 </textdata>

  Some analysts have suggested that Microsoft wants to draw out the legal battle in the hope of getting a more sympathetic ear in the White House if George W. Bush takes over the presidency in January. The Justice Department's case, which will be heard by a panel of seven appellate judges, will ultimately be supervised by the next administration. Nineteen states are also plaintiffs in the case.

  Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore agreed more than they disagreed last night in an event  that was often closer to a cordial conversation than a debate as they exchanged views on tense foreign conflicts and domestic matters like  racial profiling, gun control and same-sex marriage.

  Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore agreed more than they disagreed last night in an event  that was often closer to a cordial conversation than a debate as they exchanged views on tense foreign conflicts and domestic matters like  racial profiling, gun control and same-sex marriage.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But last night, breaking with their campaigns' scathing commercials and their own oratory, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush were respectful, and at times even complimentary. The civility prompted Mr. Bush to volunteer at one point that it seemed ''like we're having a great love-fest tonight.'' [Transcript, Page A22.]
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Not until the last 15 minutes of the evening did the candidates grow slightly combative, with Mr. Gore questioning Mr. Bush's record as governor of Texas, and Mr. Bush asserting that the vice president's tendency to embellish raised questions about his credibility. That prompted the vice president to take the unusual step of apologizing for his previous misstatements.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even when they did clash, the jabs were cloaked in decorous tones. At one point, Mr. Gore, who was hardly bashful at deriding his rival in the first debate, seemed to almost apologize when he turned to Mr. Bush and said of health care proposals in Texas: ''I'm sorry to tell you, there is a record here.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But their exchanges showed Mr. Gore to be more willing to use American force to intervene in regional conflicts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president said that a case of genocide almost automatically engaged American interests and that it was appropriate for troops to stay on to help ensure a democratic transition -- a use of American power that Mr. Bush derided as ''nation-building.'' For example, Mr. Gore supported American intervention in Haiti, which Mr. Bush characterized as a mistake.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush sought to present himself as a statesman by repeatedly saying he agreed with many of the administration's decisions. He also tried to demonstrate that he was as conversant on such matters as Mr. Gore, who has been at the center of many of the nation's most crucial decisions about international affairs. Mr. Bush made clear that he was strongly against sending troops and resources into failed states.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a nod to the nearly two weeks of bloodshed in Israel, Mr. Bush said, ''I think during the campaign, particularly during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice. And I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, like Mr. Gore, often spoke in generalities about his foreign policy philosophy. ''If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us,'' Mr. Bush said of people outside this country. ''If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore emphasized his involvement in foreign policy and described a much more activist and broader moral mission for the United States in the plight of other countries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Just as they did when they took the stage in Boston last week, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore confronted a frustrating and even tormenting reality when last night's debate began: while Mr. Bush has edged up slightly, he and the vice president are mired in a race that is a statistical dead heat. If for no other reason, the stakes in this debate were even greater than in last week's because Election Day is only 26 days away. The third and final debate is next Tuesday in St. Louis.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In many ways, the candidates sought to dispel the same critiques and stereotypes that have plagued them in the campaign. Mr. Bush sought to show that he was no bumbler and that he could comfortably navigate the ins and outs of policy, particularly foreign affairs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore, who is well known as a policy maven, tried to demonstrate that he was a likable politician and not an unappealing brawler. He succeeded in halting the audible sighs that marked his performance last week; in a contrast to last week, he at times nodded affirmatively when Mr. Bush was speaking.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At times, there was a marked contrast between Mr. Gore's seeming efforts to restrain himself from appearing belligerent and Mr. Bush's relaxed, even expansive, demeanor near the end of the encounter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Over all, the feel and the format of last night's debate seemed decidedly more casual than the first one. For one thing, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush had already endured the drill once before. But the setting was somewhat more intimate. Rather than stand at lecterns, the candidates sat at a table with Mr. Lehrer.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign had pressed for the format in the debate negotiations. Mr. Bush's aides said he was far more comfortable in a more conversational format. It was the first time participants in a presidential debate sat at a table in that format.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush had blocked hate crimes legislation, and he asserted that the governor presided over a state that ranked last in health insurance for families.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in children with health care,'' Mr. Gore said, ''49th for women with health care and 50th for families with health care.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For his part, Mr. Bush said the vice president had fought for a government-run health care system in the first two years of the Clinton administration. ''That was fortunately stopped in its tracks,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush said Mr. Gore was ''absolutely wrong'' if he was trying to suggest that Mr. Bush was a hard-hearted person who did not care about children.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush acknowledged that a  health insurance program for children ''got a late start'' in Texas. But, he insisted, ''we're reducing the number of uninsured as a percentage of our population'' in Texas, while the comparable figure is increasing nationally.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said he was not questioning the purity of Mr. Bush's heart, but challenging his priorities and values. In Texas, Mr. Gore said, Mr. Bush ''opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the Legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered, and instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the question of Mr. Gore's embellishments, Mr. Lehrer asked Mr. Bush if he thought the vice president did indeed ''stretch the facts,'' and whether that was something the voters ought to consider.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We all make mistakes,'' Mr. Bush responded. ''I have been known to mangle a syl-ABBLE or two myself.'' The deliberate mispronunciation was, of course, an allusion to several word gaucheries Mr. Bush has committed of late, and it brought a flurry of laughter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Turning suddenly serious, Mr. Bush said a president's credibility is important, both at home and abroad, and is something the voters should consider. ''This isn't something new,'' he said of Mr. Gore, bringing up a memorandum from the latter's short 1988 presidential campaign in which a staff aide warned him to stick to the facts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Looking back to their first debate, Mr. Gore admitted that he had tripped himself up on some facts. ''I got some details wrong, and some examples,'' he said. ''I'm sorry about that, and I'm going to try to do better.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In one area where both candidates seemed to agree, Mr. Gore said he would support legislation to ban racial profiling. And he repeated a pledge that his first act as president would be to issue an executive order banning the practice.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush agreed but added that he did not want to ''federalize'' the local police. ''It's very important that we not overstep our bounds,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in a sharp moment reminding viewers of his firm enforcement of the death penalty, Mr. Bush pointed to the racially motivated murder of James Byrd, a black man dragged to his death in East Texas in June 1998.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore then politely suggested that Mr. Bush was blurring his stance on hate-crimes legislation, saying that the governor had barred such legislation in Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both candidates said they opposed marriages for gays and lesbians. ''I'm not for gay marriage,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man ad a woman.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore agreed, but then added, ''I think we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He invoked Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, who in the vice-presidential debate last week joined Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, in sounding tolerant of such unions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said he was not sure what kind of view Mr. Gore was describing, and added, ''I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president also expressed his support for legislation to prevent gays and lesbians from being fired from their jobs because of their sexual orientation and asked the governor to lend his support. Mr. Bush replied, ''I don't know the particulars of this law.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On gun control, Mr. Gore said he would ''not do anything that would affect the rights'' of hunters or sportsmen or homeowners seeking to protect their families.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said assault weapons were a particular problem. He said he favored closing the gun show loophole, for which he cast a deciding vote in the Senate. The Congress has failed to complete action on the bill, he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said the government should strengthen enforcement of gun laws, keep schools gun free and issue child safety trigger locks on mandatory basis.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush echoed the importance of enforcing gun laws, saying criminals must know with ''certainty'' that they will be punished for using a weapon illegally.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said he supported instant background checks at gun shows. Texas has been an innovator, Mr. Bush said, in distributing free trigger locks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the environment, an issue that has fascinated Mr. Gore for years, the vice president was asked whether he stood by his earlier statements that environmental protection should be the central priority in the new century. He said he did, explaining, ''I think that in this 21st century, we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming. What's happening is the level of pollution is increasing, significantly.''

  THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW  Correction:  October 13, 2000, Friday  An article yesterday about the debate on Wednesday between Vice President Al Gor e and Gov. George W.

  The moment agreed upon by the campaigns for last night's debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., was 9:01 and 30 seconds, Eastern time, on the button. And since Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore were to take their seats onstage at exactly 8:58 p.m., that meant anything they might say to each other in the three and a half minutes before the debate could not be heard by television viewers.

  And at the same time, it is a way to reduce the potential for gaffes. And not just obvious ones, like the vulgar aside about a reporter that Mr. Bush made to his running mate (and an open microphone). As last week's debate in Boston demonstrated, any small mannerism or affectation, whether an audible sigh or sniffle, or a dusting of rouge on a candidate's cheeks, was potential grist for interpretation and criticism by voters and political analysts.

  There was no such interlude in the first presidential debate in Boston. Spokesmen for the campaigns and the Commission on Presidential Debates confirmed that the microphones were already on when Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore walked to their lecterns at the University of Massachusetts on Oct. 3. Although the broadcast networks begin their coverage of all the debates at 9 p.m., Eastern time, cable channels like C-Span start up in the hall at 8:30 p.m.

  Spokesmen for Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore differed yesterday over when the microphone policy was to take effect. Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said it was supposed to have been put into effect before the Boston debate. But Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager, said the agreement that ''the mikes do not go live until production time'' was negotiated this week.

  Several people involved in the negotiations said the Bush and Gore campaigns had sought, for example, to bar the networks from showing a candidate's reaction while his opponent spoke. A senior Bush adviser said the two campaigns agreed early in the negotiations that only one image should be broadcast, but the adviser added that the agreement was not binding on the networks.

  The commission also decided that for the North Carolina debate, it would supply to the pool network only one audio transmission, mixing the sound from all the microphones on the stage. In Boston, it provided three transmissions: the ''mixed'' feed, and one each from the microphones of Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush.

  Viewers of that network, he said, could hear Mr. Lieberman tell Mr. Cheney that he thought the debate went rapidly. Mr. Scully added that they could also hear Mr. Cheney reply that he had not even worn a watch, a reference, perhaps, to a moment in the 1992 debates, when President George Bush sneaked a highly visible peek at his.

  Yesterday morning, Mr. Vinroot's campaign Web site announced that the campaign would pay $500 for the best photograph of Vice President Al Gore with Mike Easley, the Democratic candidate. Like many other Southern Democrats, Mr. Easley, the state attorney general, has been conspicuously absent from several of Mr. Gore's appearances.

  That conclusion is also true for the tax cut plan proposed by Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican candidate, has presented a more sweeping package that would benefit far more New Yorkers by reducing taxes for people with all levels of income.

  Middle-class families will ''fare better under Lazio's plan than under Clinton's, although most will receive less tax relief than under Governor Bush's plan,'' writes the author of the report, Edmund J. McMahon Jr. ''Lazio's plan is particularly beneficial to families earning the median income or above in New York City's suburbs.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-12-2000

 <textdata>
  Both packages are dwarfed by the Bush proposal, which would give New Yorkers $11.1 billion in reductions. The Gore plan would save taxpayers in the state $3.5 billion, according to the report.

  * NADER-LaDUKE BENEFIT CONCERT, Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue at 33d Street, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741. Independent-minded artists turn out to support the third-party candidate who is fighting to join the debates with Al Gore and George W. Bush. Ralph Nader and his running mate, Winona LaDuke, will stump, but music fans may be equally excited by a rare acoustic performance by Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and sets by Ani DiFranco and Ben Harper. Also rallying will be the actors Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, the comedian Bill Murray and the filmmaker Michael Moore. Phil Donahue is the M.C. The event is general admission, which is an interesting experiment for the Garden; come early for the best view. Tonight at 8; admission is $20 (Powers).

  There is no joy in Goreville. At the very moment when the American people realize that they need a president who knows what he's doing in foreign policy, Mr. Gore managed to let George W. Bush hold him to a draw on international affairs. He even allowed the governor of Texas to beat him in this week's round of the hard-to-pronounce-name-dropping competition.

  It's easy, given the way Mr. Gore seemed intellectually AWOL, to overestimate Mr. Bush's performance. This is a man who, when asked how he would exercise the ''enormous power'' of the presidency, basically said he would consult Dick Cheney.

  Talking about foreign policy, Mr. Bush volunteered: ''It's also important to keep a strong ties in the Middle East with credible ties because of the energy crisis we're now in. After all, all the energy is produced from -- from the Middle East. And so I -- I appreciate what the administration is doing. I -- I hope to get a sense of, should I be fortunate enough to be the president, how my administration will react to the Middle East.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000

  Not long after, the moderator asked Mr. Gore how he and Mr. Bush differed in their approach to the Middle East. ''I haven't heard a big difference,'' Mr. Gore said.

  Mr. Gore has spent the last few days trying to live down the devastating ''Saturday Night Live'' parody of his performance in Debate No. 1, as the guy begging for permission to give two answers to the question. His staff made him watch it, presumably under the assumption that what their candidate needed was a bracing dose of utter public humiliation.

  Mr. Gore couldn't resist a temptation to sidle up to his opponent, to join hands in support of all the goopy generalities Mr. Bush was tossing into the hopper. Among the important points on which Mr. Gore felt compelled to agree:
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Mr. Gore wasn't agreeing, he was trying to explain what he wasn't. The moderator asked him to define the differences between himself and Mr. Bush on gun control. The old, mean Al Gore would have pointed out that he was the only candidate at the table who did not favor allowing people to carry concealed weapons into church. Gore Lite began with, ''Well, I'm not for registration. . . .''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When the talk turned to pollution, Mr. Gore executed a double-capitulation, managing to simultaneously agree with Mr. Bush and announce that he was not for something. (''He's right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.'')
 </textdata>

  One of Mr. Bush's favorite lines on the Balkans is that the U.S. ought to get ''our European friends to become the peacekeepers.'' He used it twice on Wednesday night. The new Gore was too polite to point out that they already provide more than 80 percent of the troops and 90 percent of the cost of the peacekeeping operation.

  Gov. George W. Bush's confident performance at the presidential debate on Wednesday night rested in part on the skillful way he portrayed the differences between himself and Vice President Al Gore. On issues ranging from hate crimes to prescription drugs, the environment and education, he spoke as if he and Mr. Gore were pursuing the same goals by somewhat different means. The new, subdued Al Gore let pass several opportunities to rebut Mr. Bush's characterizations. That may be a smart tactic, but it does little to clarify the policy record of the campaign. There is nothing ''fuzzy,'' to use the governor's words, about many differences between the two candidates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president roused himself at the end of the debate to note that the issue did not concern Mr. Bush's ''compassion'' or ''heart,'' but his priorities. The governor has become effective at declaring his support for schools, the environment and defense, but his $1.3 trillion tax cut, heavily weighted toward the wealthy, would soak up almost all of the non-Social Security and non-Medicare budget surplus, leaving little or no room for any significant increases in spending in these areas.

  Mr. Bush proclaimed his support for the environment and even said that he cared about global warming. Mr. Gore used the debate to reiterate support for partnerships with industry to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, while Mr. Bush falsely described the Kyoto agreement by asserting that it forced the United States to go it alone on making environmental changes. In fact, the agreement was signed with the understanding that in the future, developing countries like China and India would be persuaded to be a part of it, with help from the West in developing new technologies. The difference between the two contenders was the difference between ignoring a major problem and confronting it with analysis and painstaking negotiations.

  Money makes the difference between the two candidates' proposals especially acute in the health sphere and education. Mr. Gore's proposals do not constitute a giant step toward universal coverage, but the money he would spend would get the country there faster than Mr. Bush's. The governor also misstated reality when he said that the percentage  of people with health insurance was going up in Texas but down in the United States at large. In fact, between 1998 and 1999, both percentages rose, after falling for several years. For schools, Mr. Bush says he wants to increase accountability, but he does not provide much money to help local districts get there.

  The governor said he was tolerant of gays, but he apparently regards anti-discrimination protections for them as ''special rights.'' As Mr. Gore noted, Mr. Bush did nothing to support a hate-crimes bill for gays in Texas. On gun control, Mr. Bush said he favored ''instant background checks'' for guns purchased at gun shows, but he opposes a three-day waiting period that would give law enforcement agencies the time to do more thorough checks. Taken together, these are stark differences that Mr. Gore may need to do more to emphasize in the final weeks of the campaign.

  It was not a unanimous verdict, of course, as some reports mentioned misstatements by Gov. George W. Bush or his response to questions about poor health care in Texas. But in the immediate aftermath of the debate on Wednesday night in North Carolina, a consensus rapidly developed among commentators and news organizations across the nation: not only had Governor Bush performed better than in the Boston debate a week earlier, but he had also out-and-out defeated his subdued rival, Vice President Al Gore.

  ''All the polls tonight show that he won,'' George Stephanopoulos said on ''Nightline,'' a mere hour after the debate.

  As an example, Mr. Kohut pointed to the disparity last week between the news media and the public in their reactions to the Boston debate.

  In the hours after the second debate, writers and television commentators frequently concentrated on the toning down of Mr. Gore's debating style, and contrasted it with the seemingly more confident Mr. Bush. On ''The Early Show'' yesterday, an interview taped after the debate showed the reporter Bill Plante asking Mr. Gore, ''What do you make of the fact that all the snap polls showed you losing tonight?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Not much,'' Mr. Gore replied, adding, ''Last week they all showed me winning, and then within a few days the pundits kind of took a different view. I think that snap polls are not really worth that much.''

  Today, they almost echoed each other's words. Mr. Bush said he was ''saddened and angered'' by the attack in Yemen and added: ''I hope that we gather enough intelligence to figure out who did the act and take the necessary action. There must be a consequence.''

  Mr. Gore also began a campaign event at a packed Milwaukee park by asking the crowd ''for a moment of silence and prayer'' for the American sailors who were killed.

  The expense is striking in the New York area because so many middle-class families here do not qualify for the ''middle-class tax cuts'' proposed by Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Democrats focus on families making less than $60,000 per year, a sum that buys a reasonably comfortable middle-class lifestyle in the typical American community.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But that standard of living would cost about $85,000 in the New York suburbs, and $135,000 in the city. Middle-class New Yorkers earn relatively high salaries, which mean high tax brackets, so they would be prime beneficiaries of the broad tax cuts proposed by George W. Bush and Rick A. Lazio.

  In all, New York State residents would get back $11.1 billion annually from the Bush tax cuts, versus $3.5 billion from the Gore tax plan, according to a report released Wednesday by Edmund J. McMahon Jr., a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative group.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McMahon's report points to the case of a family of four making the median income in Westchester County, $83,100, and itemizing deductions. The family would get no automatic tax break from the Gore plan, although it could save $1,210 if it was paying at least $10,000 a year in college tuition. It could also, by setting aside $3,000 in a retirement account, qualify for a $1,000 tax credit that would be locked in that account.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Under the Bush tax plan, the Westchester family would save $2,628 per year, Mr. McMahon calculates. He also cites the example of a single person making $62,970 a year, the average wage in Manhattan. That person would save $1,180 under the Bush plan, but nothing under the Gore plan.

  Why, then, isn't Mr. Bush making more headway among women? One answer may be in the packaging of tax cuts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Democrats have personalized the tax cuts,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''They've targeted them at college students, children in day care, retired people. Maybe that appeals more to women than broad tax cuts. But in most cases Bush will give even bigger tax cuts to those people, and he'll give everyone else tax cuts, too.''

  During this difficult time, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush must continue to avoid exacerbating tensions as they maneuver for advantage in the presidential race. Mr. Bush responded to yesterday's events in a measured way, expressing appreciation for the Clinton administration's efforts to calm the situation in the Middle East and support for Israel. Mr. Gore broke off from campaigning to return to the White House to meet with Mr. Clinton and his top aides.

  With an eye on independent voters, Mr. Gore has been speaking above the partisan fray. On the campaign trail, he tends to avoid direct references to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, whom he calls ''my opponent,'' or to the Republicans, whom he calls ''the other side.'' He rarely blames them for foiling administration initiatives and he rarely tries to rally audiences to send local Democrats to Washington.

  To some degree, Gore supporters see the vice president as tripped up either way. His performance in the first debate with Mr. Bush was faulted as too aggressive, a criticism he tried to respond to with Wednesday's lower-keyed approach. But now he is perceived as having overcompensated, raising concern among House Democrats that he is not doing enough to help the party, even as such concern detracts from a serious evaluation of Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As Representative Jose E. Serrano, a Bronx Democrat, put it: ''Gore was told by the world not to be aggressive. But now, if he's not aggressive, that's the criticism. The other guy can do whatever he pleases.''
 </textdata>

  10-13-2000

 <textdata>
  Indeed, some Democrats on Capitol Hill said today that in Wednesday's debate, Mr. Gore seemed to take the notion of bipartisanship too far. They worried that if he does not paint differences more starkly, Democrats will stay in the minority.

  Representative Carrie P. Meek, Democrat of Florida, said: ''In terms of substance, Gore did very well. But I was a little disappointed in his assertiveness. I think he should have nailed Governor Bush more. But he was constrained and just didn't go for it.''
 </textdata>

  Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said Democrats were not abandoning Mr. Gore but wanted him to remember it was Democrats whose votes for a balanced budget in 1993 -- helping to bring about the economic boom -- cost the party the House in 1994.

  Surveys show that voters loathe the partisanship that has consumed Capitol Hill. And some voters are content with divided government, thinking that Washington could inflict as little damage as possible if it was gridlocked. On the Republican side, Governor Bush has severed himself from the Beltway battles.

  And he said Mr. Gore had done much to unify the party by promoting targeted tax cuts and paying down the debt that most Democrats were comfortable with, unlike Mr. Bush, whose tax-cut proposal has been spurned by House Republicans.

  Ever since he campaigned with Mr. Bush in early August, Mr. McCain has maintained what many Republicans consider a perplexingly low profile on the presidential trail. And though he is scheduled to campaign with Mr. Bush in Florida and New Hampshire later this month, Mr. McCain plans to devote the last crucial week of the campaign to Republican Congressional candidates, not Mr. Bush.

  Now, with the race heading toward what political analysts predict will be a photo finish, many Republicans are saying that Mr. Bush would be wise to use his former rival more aggressively on the campaign trail. Mr. McCain, they argue, remains too popular a commodity not to be exploited.

  ''If I were making the decisions for Bush, I'd be asking him to go everywhere,'' said John Nevin, campaign manager for Mike Rogers, a Congressional candidate from the Lansing, Mich., area, who has asked Mr. McCain to campaign with him. ''But I don't know that he wants to do that.''

  Advisers to Mr. Bush offered an array of reasons that the two camps had not worked more closely together. Some said it was simply due to scheduling conflicts. Others said Mr. McCain's recent treatment for skin cancer had restricted his activities. Still others argued that it would seem strange to give anyone other than Mr. Bush's running mate a prominent role in the campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''You can overdo these things,'' one Bush adviser said. But the adviser also acknowledged that ''McCain has the ability to be more helpful to us than maybe anybody else'' in certain states.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Aides to Mr. McCain contend that they have done almost everything Mr. Bush's campaign has asked, with one exception: they turned down a request to appear at the first presidential debate in Boston, arguing that there were plenty of other ''spinners'' available to help Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They also say they offered to campaign with Mr. Bush for seven days this month but were asked to do only five. And they have expressed surprise that the Bush campaign had not asked them to make radio or television commercials in Michigan or New Hampshire, closely contested states where Mr. McCain won the presidential primaries by substantial margins.

  ''Campaigns and candidates have corporate egos,'' the Republican said. ''The McCain corporate ego is such that the folks around him won't meet the Bush campaign halfway. The Bush corporate ego is such that they won't bend any further than that. They won't be magnanimous winners and say, 'What days are you available?' ''

  Whatever the reasons, Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush often seem like boats passing in the night. Today, both men were in Michigan: Mr. Bush in Grand Rapids for a rally this evening, Mr. McCain in Lansing, about a two-hour drive away, for a televised town meeting late this afternoon.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet there was no effort to have the two men's paths cross. And there are no plans right now for Mr. McCain to campaign with Mr. Bush in Michigan, though he may appear with Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McCain has not always been an effusive supporter of the Republican ticket during his appearances. On ''Larry King Live'' last week, Mr. McCain offered equal praise to Mr. Cheney and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate. And he did not mention Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some Republicans argue that it would be risky for Mr. Bush to use Mr. McCain extensively in the waning days of the campaign because the Arizona senator can be so unpredictable and outspoken, particularly on issues on which the two men disagree, like campaign finance reform.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000

 <textdata>
  ''I'd be saying to John McCain: 'I'll give you whatever it takes -- a plane, a staff, whatever,' '' said the senior Republican adviser to the Bush campaign. ''But I guess that's not the view from Austin, Tex.''

  In Wednesday night's debate at Wake Forest University, both presidential candidates spoke out firmly against racial profiling, the police practice of stopping cars because of the race of their drivers. ''I can't imagine what it's like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed,'' George W. Bush said. ''That's flat wrong.'' Asked by the moderator, Jim Lehrer, if he would support a federal law to stop racial profiling, Mr. Bush said yes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000

 <textdata>
  Al Gore was more specific. Not only would he issue an executive order to stop racial profiling in federal law enforcement, he said, but if he were to win the presidency, a federal ban on racial profiling would be ''the first civil rights act of the 21st century.''

  Halfway through the presidential debate on Wednesday, after Vice President Al Gore expressed support for hate crimes legislation and cited the 1998 slaying of a black Texas man, James Byrd Jr., the moderator Jim Lehrer turned to Gov.

 <textdata>
  The moment was noteworthy for two reasons. First, as his campaign later conceded, Mr. Bush had his facts wrong -- two of the three defendants were sentenced to death, the third received life in prison. But by seeming to endorse the executions, he also violated his own policy as Texas governor of maintaining his silence and impartiality about pending death penalty cases until court appeals are exhausted and the cases reach his desk.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Whether his segue from hate crimes to the death penalty was spontaneous or a calculated response was a matter of speculation today. The Gore campaign accused Mr. Bush of trying to deflect attention from his unwillingness to push for an enhanced 1999 hate crimes bill named for Mr. Byrd that died in the State Senate. And Mr. Byrd's daughter, Renee Mullins, who lobbied Mr. Bush in 1999 to help pass that bill, said in an interview today that the governor pointedly told her that he would not work to do so.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I pleaded with him,'' Ms. Mullins recounted of her meeting with Mr. Bush. Ms. Mullins said she did not watch the debate on Wednesday but that she was offended when she learned that Mr. Bush expressed support for hate crimes legislation. ''He's not practicing what he's preaching,'' she said. ''I just went to him last year and he didn't support me. So how could he support one?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dan Bartlett, a Bush campaign spokesman, attributed the governor's inaction on the Byrd bill in 1999 to several factors. He said Mr. Bush often did not get involved with bills that were not part of his own legislative package. He also noted that critics of the Byrd bill, which calls for stiffer penalties for crimes motivated by race, gender, religion and sexual orientation, argued that it might weaken a statute in effect since 1993. That statute says that penalties can be enhanced if a crime is committed out of bias or prejudice, but it does not specify which groups are protected.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By so bluntly invoking the death penalty, Mr. Bush brought attention to an issue that he had sought to play down in the campaign. Since taking office in 1995, Mr. Bush has presided over 146 executions, including 33 this year, by far the most of any governor in the nation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As governor, Mr. Bush's powers to stop an execution are limited. He can grant clemency only with the approval of the state parole board, though he does appoint its members. Otherwise, he can either grant an inmate a 30-day reprieve or approve the execution.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Critics of the Texas capital punishment system have faulted Mr. Bush for defending a system that executes inmates who are mentally retarded, who committed slayings as juveniles and who, in many cases, have been represented by court-appointed lawyers regarded as inadequate. This year, Mr. Bush has interrupted his campaign to preside over the high-profile execution of Gary Graham, who was convicted of murder on the word of one eyewitness.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also granted the first reprieve of his tenure to Ricky McGinn to allow additional DNA testing in the case. The tests later confirmed his guilt and Mr. McGinn was subsequently executed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's blunt endorsement of the executions of the defendants in the Byrd case -- even though the appeals process has only begun -- brought a swift response from some legal scholars and other critics who say the comments undermine the legal principle of due process.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The seriousness with which Mr. Bush's undertakes his obligations toward the death penalty has been questioned before in the campaign. In an interview in Talk Magazine, Gary Bauer, the conservative who was then a Republican presidential candidate, criticized Mr. Bush for appearing to mock Karla Faye Tucker, the Texas killer of two, for pleading for her life in a television interview. Mr. Bush campaign aides said his comments were misinterpreted. Ms. Tucker was executed in 1998.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  In early March, in a Republican primary debate in Los Angeles, Mr. Bush laughed when a questioner asked about a case in which a Texas lawyer fell asleep while representing an inmate who later received the death penalty. Mr. Bartlett said the response was not laughter but an expression of incredulity at the question. He also said that Mr. Bush regards his review of death cases as ''his most important duty'' and addresses them in a very serious and factual way.

  Gov. George W. Bush's statement in Wednesday night's debate that all three men convicted of the brutal murder of James Byrd will be executed in Texas, when in fact only two will be, is far more serious than his previous gaffes, and gives voters reason to question Mr. Bush's claim that he is a ''compassionate conservative'' (front page, Oct. 12).

  Mr. Bush's rush to judgment only underscores his evidently unreflective embrace of capital punishment at a time when increasing numbers of Americans are questioning the validity and effectiveness of the death penalty. It also confirms worries about his inattention to detail on other serious matters facing our country.

  With two debates down and one to go, the presidential candidates returned to swing states today as Vice President Al Gore stepped up his assault on George W. Bush's record as governor of Texas and the Bush campaign exulted in what it characterized as a turning-point moment in the 2000 campaign.

  Mr. Bush, meanwhile, traveled to Pennsylvania, where he accused Mr. Gore of making ''fear, division and misrepresentation'' the hallmarks of the final stage of his campaign. The mood of the Bush campaign was ebullient after Wednesday's debate in which aides felt that Mr. Bush had survived prolonged questioning about foreign policy, his biggest weakness.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The confidence seemed to exceed the traditional post-debate spin. About an hour after the debate ended, an ABC News producer overheard Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, speaking on the telephone to another aide who was with Mr. Bush, about instant polls showing that Mr. Bush had won the debate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, William M. Daley, predicted that the instant polls would prove meaningless. He pointed out that such polls favored Mr. Gore after the first debate last week in Boston, but that the numbers quickly turned toward Mr. Bush as news reports focused on Mr. Gore's factual mistakes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If Mr. Gore was concerned about the debate, he showed no public signs of it today. He delivered a vigorous speech before a large crowd in Milwaukee, and joked in an interview with the NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw about his subdued performance. ''I put all my sighs in a lock box,'' he said. The third and final debate will be on Tuesday in St. Louis.

  In perhaps the ultimate demonstration of the political power of incumbency, Mr. Gore cut short his schedule in Milwaukee this afternoon and returned to Washington to monitor events in the Middle East and, in the process, to reinforce the notion of his foreign policy expertise.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore did not cancel any public events; he had been planning to fly to  Washington this afternoon to attend a high school football team dinner with his son, Albert.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He's vice president, he's part of the national security team, and a situation like this requires that the full team be in place,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A vice-presidential spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said this evening that Mr. Gore did attend the dinner with his son.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Earlier in Milwaukee, Mr. Gore spoke to several thousand people under brilliant skies in Cathedral Square. His wife, Tipper, was at his side as he offered one of his most cogent explanations of the choice to be made in the 2000 election.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Gore argued that Mr. Bush's record as Texas governor provided voters with ''an important window on to what his priorities are.'' And he said that record was particularly relevant because Texas enjoyed a large surplus at the beginning of Mr. Bush's first term, just as the federal government does now.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If you were governor of the state that ranked dead last, 50 out of 50, in health insurance for families,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and all of a sudden you found that you had the biggest surplus in the history of your state, wouldn't it occur to you to use some of that surplus to maybe move up in the rankings on health care for families from 50 to 45 or 40 or even better? That's not what happened there.''
 </textdata>

  10-13-2000

  Mr. Gore's aides have promised an intensified attack on Mr. Bush's record on health care, the environment, gun control and the minimum wage. But they had left the impression that the burden would be carried by television advertising, surrogates and Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who campaigned today in Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But today, Mr. Gore spoke for himself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is not a question about my opponent's heart,'' he said, referring to Mr. Bush's assertion in the debate that the vice president seems to consider him a hard-hearted person.  ''It's a question about his priorities. His priorities are different from mine and I think they're different from yours.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said he readily acknowledged that his proposed menu of middle-class tax cuts, worth about $500 billion over 10 years, was far smaller than Mr. Bush's plan for a $1.3. trillion across-the-board tax cut.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Shortly before Mr. Gore spoke, Mr. Daley held a conference call with reporters to argue that Mr. Bush should be held accountable for his misstatement in last night's debate in the same way that Mr. Gore's factual errors were scrutinized last week.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, during a discussion of hate crimes legislation, said that all three men who were convicted of murdering Mr. Byrd, who was dragged to his death in 1998, were ''going to be put to death.'' In fact, one of the three was sentenced to life in prison, and all three are in the early stages of their appeals.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Daley and other Gore representatives, including a Harvard Law School professor, Laurence H. Tribe, also maintained that Mr. Bush's assertion as the chief law enforcement official in Texas could be found prejudicial to judges or juries that consider the cases in the future.
 </textdata>

  Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, acknowledged that Mr. Bush had erred.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a packed gymnasium at Neshimany High School in Langhorne, Pa., Mr. Bush spoke about ''the greatest generation'' and focused on his plans to change Social Security and overhaul Medicare by coaxing people into private insurance plans, some of which could include a prescription drug benefit.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Mr. Gore asserts that the Bush plan would fail to guarantee drug benefits to all of the elderly, it amounts to scare tactics, Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''As the election nears, he has fallen back on a familiar strategy: fear, division and misrepresentation,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also criticized the Clinton administration for rejecting the recommendations of a bipartisan Congressional commission that proposed to reform Medicare by encouraging private insurers to compete with government coverage plans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''That's exactly why the time has come for a new administration,'' he said. ''On Social Security and on Medicare, the routine of the Clinton-Gore administration is so predictable, so tired and so partisan.''

  Still, Mr. Bush's delight at the prospect of putting Texans to death shows him to be an inhumane chief executive. No matter what one's opinion of capital punishment is, surely Americans can all agree that unnatural death is never a cause for the sort of glee that Mr. Bush evinced.

Both acted as if they were unaware that these words had been used in their ads. Are we to believe, then, that if they don't know what is going on inside their own campaigns, they won't know what is going on inside their administrations? Will they simply pass the buck and say they were unaware?

  You know, this whole issue is one where I have gone well beyond the letter of the law. We've put up on our Web site everything that our charitable foundation has given to.

You know, we've gone well beyond what Governor Bush or Secretary Cheney have done, and I don't hear the same kind of complaint coming out of my opponent with regard to their disclosure.

  The two candidates also tussled over Social Security. Mr. Corzine accused Mr. Franks of wanting to ''dismantle'' the Social Security system because he supported Gov. George W. Bush's plan to allow individuals to divert a small part of their payroll taxes to investments in the stock market. Mr. Franks replied that Mr. Corzine's idea of letting the government invest Social Security Trust Fund money in the stock market, perhaps through the Federal Reserve System, was ''dangerous.''

  Mr. Gore's handlers and media critics did him a disservice by railing against his confrontational style. His stylistic overcorrection into an almost absurdly congenial debater reinforced the fact that no one can discern the real Al Gore. The criticism from the media, echoed by a shift in the polls, forced Mr. Gore into a box and allowed Mr. Bush to take command of the debate and the race.  SCOTT A. DERGANCE  New York, Oct. 12, 2000

  The explosion came at the height of the American presidential race. Along with the violence in Israel, it immediately eclipsed the campaign debate. Vice President Al Gore returned to Washington from the campaign trail to participate in meetings at the White House about both crises. His Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, called for a vigorous, united approach on both fronts.

  Norma Nunez, 39, told of surviving thyroid cancer and pituitary cancer, and of seeing several family members suffer from cancer and other severe illnesses. She said of Mr. Bush, ''Him being the governor, being over the environment of Texas, he hasn't done nothing for us.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Lieberman said, ''The record here shows Governor Bush has failed to lead.'' He cited federal reports ranking Texas as allowing the highest level of toxic industrial emissions into the air and the third-highest rate into the water, and he noted Houston's status as nation's smog capital.

 <textdata>
  The poor neighborhood Mr. Lieberman visited is near a petrochemical plant, one of hundreds of older factories in Texas that are the subject of a long-running environmental dispute. Mr. Bush's detractors and supporters say the plants are central to his environmental record.

  Plants built before the 1970 Clean Air Act are largely exempt from federal emissions standards, but states can impose their own rules. For three years, Mr. Bush has promoted voluntary emissions reductions for most older plants, and last year that approach was used in a law written partly by industry officials.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000

  Mr. Bartlett said that under Mr. Bush, toxic industrial air emissions had declined -- a drop traceable to newer plants -- but toxic emissions have declined nationally as well. Meanwhile, ozone levels have risen in Houston and other Texas cities.

  In June 1995, Vice President Al Gore signed a secret agreement with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister, calling for an end to all Russian sales of conventional weapons to Iran by the end of 1999.

 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Though Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin mentioned an arms agreement in general terms at a news conference the day it was signed, the details have never been disclosed to Congress or to the public.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Senator McCain said this month that he was unaware of the deal that Mr. Gore struck with Mr. Chernomyrdin, which was codified in a document stamped ''Secret'' and signed in Moscow on June 30, 1995. Mr. McCain said a ''strong case can be made'' that the Russian delivery of arms, especially the submarine, should have triggered sanctions against Moscow under the provisions of the Gore-McCain law.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's chief foreign policy adviser, Leon Fuerth, said the deliveries were not subject to sanctions because they did not meet the 1992 act's definition of ''advanced conventional weapons'' and did not significantly change the balance of power in the Persian Gulf. But, he said, Mr. Gore brandished the threat as leverage to induce the Russians to sign the agreement, in part to learn more about what arms Moscow was sending to Tehran.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore and Mr. McCain specifically cited the submarine and its deadly long-range torpedoes as one reason the 1992 nonproliferation act was needed, according to the Congressional Research Service.
 </textdata>

  President Clinton entrusted his vice president with an extraordinary degree of authority to manage one of the most important accounts in American diplomacy. Mr. Gore used that authority to pursue a broad agenda on issues from arms control to the environment to cooperation in space.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Much of that work was carried out in a channel known as the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which was established in 1993 and which met twice a year until Boris N. Yeltsin, the former president, dismissed Mr. Chernomyrdin in March 1998. Mr. Gore has cited the work of the commission as among his signal achievements as vice president and an important part of his resume for the presidency.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some critics in Congress, as well as Governor George W. Bush's foreign policy advisers, say that Mr. Gore placed too much faith in his close personal relationship with Mr. Chernomyrdin, and that this led Mr. Gore to turn a blind eye to strong evidence of corruption by Mr. Chernomyrdin and associates, who appear to have profited handsomely from the rapid privatization of Soviet state enterprises.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush himself touched on this criticism during his debate Wednesday night with Mr. Gore when he said in a discussion of Washington's world role:
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president and his advisers respond that the Gore-Chernomyrdin channel produced scores of agreements on a wide range of topics in part because of the strong bond between the men. Mr. Gore was fully aware of the allegations of corruption against Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Fuerth said, but he also believed that the prime minister was dedicated to reform and had the clout to cut through the bureaucracy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It was one more of these strange deals that Gore and Chernomyrdin had that were kept from people,'' said Mr. Oehler, now a vice president with the Science Applications International Corporation in La Jolla, Calif. ''If this had been disclosed to Congress, the committees would have gone berserk, absolutely. But the larger problem is, if you have these under-the-table deals that give the Russians permission to do these things, it gives the signal that it's O.K. to do other things.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The 1995 arms agreement between Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin was just one of more than a dozen during a three-day meeting in Moscow, the fifth session of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, but it was not included in a list of accords released by the White House.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, the men mentioned it in passing at a news conference at the end of their meeting. Mr. Chernomyrdin said the Iran accord was the product of ''difficult and lengthy talks.'' Mr. Gore indicated that deliveries of conventional arms to Iran would end within a few years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000

 <textdata>
  ''This is significant, very significant,'' Mr. Gore said at the news conference. ''I would say that this has been resolved in a specific, mutually agreed fashion that does not leave any uncertainty or open ends that would create problems.''

  In Michigan, long the heart of the nation's labor movement, unions are making an all-out push to give Mr. Gore the edge in a pivotal state where the presidential race is neck and neck. Dozens of union members have taken leaves from their jobs to do full-time, union-paid campaign work for six weeks. And the state's unions plan to send more than two million pieces of mail in support of Mr. Gore and other Democratic candidates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000

 <textdata>
  The state's -- and the nation's -- labor leaders are making a major effort to rouse enthusiasm for Mr. Gore among union members, many of whom were ambivalent or hostile toward him just a few months ago.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has often had frosty relations with labor unions, which resent his support of the China trade deal and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Several unions have also been tempted to support Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate and a fierce opponent of Nafta and the deal to liberalize trade with China.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But union leaders said the differences were so stark between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush on tax cuts, privatizing Social Security, raising the minimum wage and other issues that most union members have lined up behind Mr. Gore and even begun feeling enthusiastic toward him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both candidates consider Michigan's union membership crucial. Mr. Bush, who plans to visit a General Motors plant in Pontiac on Friday, is  making a play for the state's ''Reagan Democrats'' who drifted into the Republican fold in the 1980's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''But there's a fundamental problem with labor leaders trying to push Al Gore over the top,'' Mr. Hills said, ''And that is we have a lot of inroads with working men and women frankly because Al Gore is not good for the auto industry. Remember, he once said that the internal combustion engine is the single greatest threat to mankind.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s internal polls show that Michigan union members favor Mr. Gore over Mr. Bush, 60 percent to 23 percent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In mounting their pro-Gore offensive, unions have pushed aside a thorny issue, trade. That issue caused the mighty U.A.W. and Teamsters, both livid about the Clinton administration's support of the China trade bill, to delay endorsing Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''On one hand, union members are critical of the administration on the China trade issue,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''But on the other hand, they recognize the contrast between the two candidates is so great. They realize that Gore by far will be much better for working families.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For labor leaders, one big worry has dissipated. Several months ago, Mr. Nader reached 8 percent in some state polls, partly because many workers liked his views on trade. This made union leaders worry that Mr. Gore would lose the state, but new polls show that Mr. Nader's support has fallen sharply.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One problem for Mr. Gore is that some union members believe that President Clinton has done too little for labor. In the lunchroom of the Yellow Freight terminal in Detroit, Tim Brochue, a truck driver who supports Mr. Bush, said, ''These Democrats haven't done anything for the unions. Clinton was a liar, and Gore was right at his side.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Across the long lunch table, Doug Ray, a fellow Teamster, disagreed, saying, ''I'm voting for Gore. Bush is mostly for the rich people. The only reason he's running is to help big money and big business.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  But just as investors are unprepared for the notion that stocks can go down and stay down, so are the folks in Washington. The great budget debate being conducted by Al Gore and George W. Bush assumes there will be trillions in surpluses over the next decade that they can divvy up in tax cuts and spending. There is no discussion of just how closely those surpluses have been tied to the bull market.

  Vice President Al Gore's campaign cited the dispute over the accuracy of Mr. Bush's statement as proof that the Texas governor ''does not meet presidential standards'' in foreign policy. The Clinton administration has defended the I.M.F. as vital in financial emergencies.

  Mr. Bush on Wednesday named Russia as an ''egregious'' example of misspent aid. He said Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister, had personally profited from I.M.F. lending. Some of the agency's money ''ended up in Viktor Chernomyrdin's pocket,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Chernomyrdin issued a statement in Moscow today denying the accusations and threatening to sue Mr. Bush for slander.
 </textdata>

  10-13-2000

  ''I think Mr. Bush Jr. should be getting ready for a court hearing on the issue,'' Mr. Chernomyrdin said.

  The Bush campaign said today that Mr. Bush stood by his statement.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush himself softened his tone today in an interview with Fox News. The governor said it was ''general knowledge'' that people in Russia had taken I.M.F. aid, but he raised the possibility that Mr. Chernomyrdin might have taken some other kind of aid money.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-13-2000

  ''It might not have been; it might have been another aid,'' Mr. Bush said when asked if he had evidence to support his earlier accusation.

  BUSH CRITICIZES GORE IN CAR COUNTRY  Gov. George W. Bush strongly criticized Vice President Al Gore in Pontiac, Mich., yesterday as an enemy of the automobile whose concern for the environment trumped the economic interests of many people in Michigan, a crucial swing state. Mr. Bush rummaged through Mr. Gore's voting record and his 1992 book on the environment, ''Earth in the Balance,'' to make his points, and noted the vice president's tie-breaking vote in the Senate in 1993 to raise gasoline taxes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''In speeches, he calls auto workers his friends,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But in his book, he declares that the engines that power your cars are his enemy.'' Mr. Bush went on: ''The internal combustion engine, Mr. Gore wrote, is, and I quote, 'a mortal threat to the security of every nation that is more deadly than that of any military enemy we're ever likely to confront.' Unlike Al Gore, I don't consider the internal combustion engine a threat to the future of mankind. I consider it a remarkable testimony to American ingenuity.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, said that accusation was wholly unfounded. Mr. Gore's campaign proposals included no new energy taxes, Ms. Spell said, and the incentives he had outlined for the manufacture of vehicles not powered solely by gasoline were meant to benefit, not punish, the auto industry.

  As soon as the first presidential debate ended last week, Vice President Al Gore's wife, three daughters and son-in-law joined him on stage, creating a handsome family portrait for the cameras. But Mr. Gore thought the picture was incomplete. He motioned to the audience, summoning an older man with a weathered face and a shock of white hair, who bounded up, giving Mr. Gore a hearty hug and a slap on the back.

  Sixteen years later, Mr. Hunger is  perhaps the vice president's closest friend. And in this campaign, as in Gore campaigns past, he is also among Mr. Gore's most valued advisers, a man whose counsel is treasured because he has no agenda other than the advancement of Al Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A successful corporate litigator and former top Justice Department official, Mr. Hunger, 64, is sometimes mentioned as a potential attorney general in a Gore administration, a Robert Kennedy to Mr. Gore's John. Such nepotism would probably be politically untenable today. But if Mr. Gore wins, Mr. Hunger will clearly be one of the most influential people in the White House, whether he works there or not.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Hunger was among the few in a Nashville hotel room when Mr. Gore winnowed his list of potential running mates to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. When one aide asked whether the country was ready for a Jewish vice president, Mr. Hunger silenced the discussion. ''If it's not,'' he said, ''it damn well should be.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Since taking unpaid leave from a Washington law office on June 30, Mr. Hunger, often in his campaign uniform of dungarees and running shoes, has traveled with Mr. Gore virtually every day, as he did today  here in Milwaukee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Of the many voices that Mr. Gore hears on strategic issues, Mr. Hunger's redolent Mississippi drawl is often the last. He serves as an intermediary between the campaign staff and the candidate, delivering difficult messages and gauging the correct moment to approach Mr. Gore for thorny decisions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His politics, Mr. Hunger said, are similar to Mr. Gore's, but he generally avoids discussions of government policy, feeling it is not his place. He  helps Mr. Gore prepare for debates, however, sometimes simply by buffering him from a deluge of advice. He served as a sounding board for Mr. Gore's convention speech. He will also get people hired to the campaign staff. And at the vice president's request, he investigated why the campaign was hemorrhaging money last year, and as a result recommended moving the headquarters from Washington to less expensive Nashville.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He did rail at Gore aides, however, when the vice president took what Mr. Hunger considered a boneheaded position on Elian Gonzalez and when the campaign did not move quickly to quash the furor over Mr. Gore's claims about the price of drugs for his dog. Known for a sense of connection to typical Americans,  he took an early interest in the rising price of gasoline and advised Mr. Gore to get out in front of the issue.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And yet less weighty matters are not beneath his concern. When Mr. Gore strolled barefoot along a Florida beach last week while being interviewed by two reporters, Mr. Hunger walked alongside and issued constant alerts -- ''Watch your foot!'' -- about sharp shells in the sand.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But perhaps Mr. Hunger's most significant role is as Mr. Gore's fun-loving alter ego. Mischievous and slightly irreverent, he is the crazy uncle of both the Gore family and the Gore campaign, and it falls to him to keep the famously disciplined candidate loose and relaxed. He is easy to laugh, eager to dance and ready with a Rebel whoop at any sign of good news. On Mr. Gore's post-convention riverboat trip down the Mississippi, he walked the decks in bare feet, shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  With no children of his own, he is devoted to the four Gore children; he has attended their ballgames, been to their graduations and slipped them sips of his beer. Even the campaign staff calls him Uncle Frank. For years, he had Mr. Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna, believing that he had shared a bunk with Elvis Presley in the military (though Presley served in the Army and Mr. Hunger in the Air Force). On his 60th birthday, at Kristin Gore's urging, he jumped from an airplane at 11,000 feet. The free fall, he says, ''scared the bejesus out of me.''

  Mr. Hunger has only grown closer to his brother-in-law since the death of Nancy Hunger, Mr. Gore's older sister, who was a longtime smoker. The bond was forged in part during the two agonizing years when the men researched her lung-cancer treatment and consoled each other through her deterioration. Mr. Hunger encouraged Mr. Gore to speak about her death in his anti-tobacco speech at the 1996 Democratic National Convention, not anticipating the cynical reaction following news accounts that Mr. Gore had boasted, while in tobacco country during previous campaigns, that he had farmed the crop. ''Might have been one of the dumber things I've done,'' Mr. Hunger said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore says he values Mr. Hunger for his integrity, his experience and his judgment, which the vice president says is ''the best of practically anybody I know.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Hunger met Nancy Gore while visiting a longtime friend from Winona at Vanderbilt, where she was an undergraduate. Gregarious, smart and sophisticated, she captivated him as she did most all who knew her. ''She was one of the most attractive women I'd ever seen in my life,'' he said. They began dating several years later and married in 1966.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was lucrative work. The last financial disclosure report that Mr. Hunger filed with the Justice Department, in 1999, showed he had assets of at least $4 million. Among them were significant holdings in the companies that Mr. Gore now derides as ''big oil'' and ''big drug companies.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Hunger had become assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's immense civil division, with nearly 700 lawyers handling 22,000 cases, after the 1992 election. Mr. Gore helped him get the appointment, but in his six years at Justice he won widespread admiration for his judgment in a broad variety of cases, including the government's ultimately unsuccessful defense of the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to regulate tobacco.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Those who worked with Mr. Hunger at Justice say he never overtly played the Gore card.

  THE SCRIPT -- ''In the end, it's about the issues. Hillary supports guaranteed prescription drug coverage for all seniors. Lazio voted no with the drug companies. Hillary supports adding 100,000 new teachers. Lazio has voted no -- voted with Gingrich for the biggest education cuts in history. Hillary says use the surplus to extend Social Security. Lazio, like George Bush -- a trillion-dollar tax plan. His plans squander the surplus. Hillary's the one who'll be a strong voice for us.''

 <textdata>
  ACCURACY -- Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio both support expanding Medicare to cover some prescription drug costs for the elderly, but Mr. Lazio supports a more limited federal program. Mr. Lazio's aides say Mrs. Clinton has also proposed large cuts in education spending. Mr. Lazio asserts that his tax cut plan would cost less than the one proposed by Mr. Bush, and that there is enough money in the federal surplus to ensure the stability of Social Security.

 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  In the last two weeks, the campaign of Mr. Lieberman's running mate, Vice President Al Gore, has made Mr. Bush's record in Texas a central part of its message, warning in campaign appearances and television commercials that conditions in the state could be duplicated elsewhere if Mr. Bush became president. Mr. Lieberman carried that message yesterday to Odessa, in West Texas, to call attention to pollution there.

  ''These acts of failed leadership by Governor Bush are part of what the American people should consider as they decide how to vote this year,'' he said today.

  The Bush administration said the ''colonias,'' ramshackle, unincorporated settlements in the state's border regions, and the environmental problems long predate the governor's tenure, and that he should be credited for trying to address them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush has also been assailed by Hispanic leaders and advocates for the poor, for never having visited a colonia, an omission they say shows his insensitivity.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You don't have to go to Alaska to know it's cold, and I don't think you have to go to colonias to know what it's like,'' said Elton Bomer, Mr. Bush's secretary of state, whom the governor has put in charge of addressing problems of the colonias. In a conference call with reporters that was arranged by the Bush campaign, Mr. Bomer said such a visit would be no more than ''a photo op.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''No one has done more to improve the living conditions of the Texas colonias than Governor Bush has,'' Mr. Bomer said. But Texas Democrats insist that Mr. Bush's Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, did more.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bomer said $600 million has been spent on the colonias under Mr. Bush; but only $250 million of that was state money, and that state money came from bond acts approved by voters during previous administrations. He said the state planned to spend $25 million on sewer hookups for the villages. Mr. Bush also signed a bill eliminating some bureaucratic barriers to connecting colonias to sewer, water and electric service.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush has also opposed several pieces of legislation that would have greatly increased state spending on the communities.

  In the early 1990's, groups like FAIR and politicians like Patrick Buchanan and Pete Wilson attacked immigration as a threat to the economic security of millions of Americans. Today such claims ring hollow, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas deserves credit for altering the tenor of his party's rhetoric on immigration.

  ''Before the first debate, I was saying, 'You know, Gore might not be a bad choice, the way the economy's going,' '' said Mr. Suica, a 42-year-old Republican with two Bush-Cheney signs in his front yard.

  After the second debate, Ms. Proctor felt that way even more. ''I thought Bush did much better,'' she said. ''He seemed more in command, in control, and Gore is just so darn irritating. I thought, if I have to listen to that man for four years, I'll go crazy. You know, it's one thing for a politician to get caught in a smart lie. But in a stupid lie, that's another thing.''

  This year, Mr. Romero was open to suggestion. In the summer, Gov. George W. Bush's nephew George P.

He watched both debates closely, and in the second one, on Wednesday, had a flash.

  ''They kept agreeing with each other,'' he said. ''I thought maybe what we ought to do is not make a change. I like Bush. I like his easy manner. But right now, after what I watched, it's like a friendly game of badminton, and the economy is great. So why make a change?''

  Evenly divided is how the conversation went this week in interviews up and down the streets of Santa Ana, smack in the heart of a county that was once a Republican stronghold. Eight years ago, this Congressional district, long represented by the fiery conservative Robert K. Dornan, voted for George Bush. But its demographics have been steadily changing, and now nearly half its residents are of Hispanic origin.

  ''Did either one of them really burst out of their shell?'' asked Clarin Cheek, 30, speaking of the performances of Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore in the debate.  ''No.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There are some things I like Bush better on,'' Mr. Cheek said. ''I thought he'd be more judicious about intervening in situations around the world than Gore. We can't just go off everywhere.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Ms. Cheek added, ''Since these events in the Middle East, I feel a little bit more confident with Gore having international experience.''

  Just across the street, Thomas Hunsaker, 38, a tile contractor renovating a house, called himself ''a moderate conservative'' and confessed that after he watched part of this week's debate, ''Gore scares me, where he'd take the country.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At the same time, Mr. Hunsaker said, ''I do think Bush would do more to support the military, and I think he'd take a stronger foreign policy role without sticking his neck out everywhere. I don't think the economy's got any correlation with Clinton and Gore and their staff. A lot of it is from things that happened six, seven, eight years before.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Hector De La Torre, a 40-something elementary school teacher who usually votes Democratic, used exactly the same word as Mr. Hunsaker, except to describe Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Bush really scares me,'' Mr. De La Torre said as he stopped on Fourth Street to chat. ''He doesn't know his facts in his own state. He didn't know and he could defend himself and his tax plan when Gore attacked him. He said, 'I care about the environment,' but he couldn't explain the smog in Houston.''

  ''I thought that in this debate, Bush did edge Gore out,'' said Mr. Hartman, a Navy veteran of World War II. ''He seemed more relaxed. But right now we're into this very bad situation in the Middle East, and how would he handle that if he doesn't have experience?'' But moments later he added, ''I think either way we're going to have a good president, but I think I'd feel better if it were Bush.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000

  Mr. Joslyn is a Republican and a Bush supporter, but he said neither candidate was adequately addressing the burden that aging baby boomers would place on the Medicare and Social Security systems.

 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush, in a speech to automotive designers and engineers here today, used the prism of the Middle East to revisit and disparage Vice President Al Gore's recommendation to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. President Clinton subsequently took that step, intended largely to keep rising fuel prices under control as winter approached.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-14-2000

 <textdata>
  With their remarks, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney showed that they were prepared to make events in the Middle East a part of the campaign debate, although it was a course that they were pursuing with obvious caution, lest they be accused of using a tragedy to score political points.

  Thus far, Mr. Bush has not questioned the administration's diplomatic efforts, saying that the United States must ''speak with one voice'' at times like this. And he has weighed in only vaguely about the correct response to the terrorist attack on the Cole, saying there ''must be a consequence.''

Mr. Bush, who turned his fund-raising attentions to the party in April after he had sewn up the nomination, is responsible for $125 million of that, or 66 percent, party officials said. He raised the money through coast-to-coast personal appearances and direct-mail letters to specific voters.

  Labor is also expected to spend millions for Mr. Gore. As in 1998, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is spending less on television commercials and more on outreach programs in which union members call other union workers and urge them to vote Democratic. Incalculable in terms of money -- and value -- to Mr. Gore are factors like the United Auto Workers' having won in their contract the right to take off Election Day as a paid holiday, thus allowing them to devote the day to taking people to the polls to vote for Mr. Gore.

  Greg Simon, an adviser to the Gore campaign who is of Lebanese descent, said there was no awkwardness in meeting with Arab-Americans at a time of such tension in the Middle East.

  The Gore-Chernomyrdin deal, calling for an end to all Russian deliveries of arms to Iran by the end of 1999, was never fully disclosed to Congress or the public. Russia has failed to meet the deadline, over the protests of Mr. Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.

The agreement is in a secret document that states that its terms will remain ''strictly confidential.''

  The Clinton administration, like the Bush administration before it, unwisely chose to advance the ''peace process'' as quickly as possible, attempting in effect to force the Palestinians and those Arabs allied to their cause to make de facto recognition of Israel de jure.

  If clearly received and acted upon on Nov. 7, the message could play some role in determining which candidate -- Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W.

But for many of us, the first impression is the lasting impression.''

  George W. Bush endorsed ''instant background checks at gun shows.'' But the bill he supports allows gun show sales to be completed within 24 hours even if the purchaser has not been cleared; alternative legislation allows up to three days to complete the check. The difference is significant. While 95 percent of background checks are completed in 24 hours, in the 5 percent of checks that take more than a day, the buyers are 20 times more likely to be a felon or other prohibited buyer.

  ''Governor Bush's proposal would be more than a major untested shift in America's foreign policy for the last half-century,'' Mr. Gore said in a speech at a union rally here. ''It would be one that could jeopardize fragile alliances. It would be a damaging blow to NATO.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both Mr. Gore and Dr. Albright were denouncing a proposal put forth by Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's security adviser, that the United States should provide intelligence and logistics support for NATO peacekeepers in places like Kosovo and Bosnia, but should not keep troops there indefinitely. Indeed, Ms. Rice, in interviews with The New York Times that were published today, said a Bush administration would work to redeploy the 11,400 ground troops -- about one-fifth of the 65,000 NATO peacekeeping troops in the region -- out of the Balkans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Rice's comments, which the Bush campaign reiterated today, are perhaps the boldest remarks about international affairs in a campaign noticeably devoid of them. The remarks fleshed out Mr. Bush's repeated statements that American troops should not be used in peacekeeping missions and should instead concentrate their efforts on preparing to fight wars in places like the Persian Gulf and the Korean peninsula.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even as the Gore campaign and Clinton administration officials denigrated the Bush position, the Republican candidate's camp restated his support of Ms. Rice's idea.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''One hundred percent,'' Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the Bush campaign, said when asked if Mr. Bush stood by his security adviser's remarks. ''The role of the United States military is not to be all things to all people. Governor Bush does not support an open-ended commitment to keep our troops as peacekeepers in the Balkans.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a statement released by the Bush campaign today, Ms. Rice said: ''Vice President Gore seems to have a vision of an indefinite U.S. military deployment in the Balkans. He proved today that if he is elected, America's military will continue to be overdeployed, harming morale and re-enlistment rates, weakening our military's core mission.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  The criticisms from Mr. Gore and the administration were determined and coordinated. Mr. Gore inserted the issue into his pre-arranged schedule, beginning his speech at the labor union rally with remarks about foreign affairs and following up with an interview with The New York Times. Mrs. Albright's staff arranged for her to call reporters, and Mr. Gore's chief foreign policy advisor, Leon Fuerth, scheduled a conference call for news organizations to rebut Ms. Rice's views.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gore campaign officials clearly believe that Ms. Rice's remarks provide them with an opening in the final weeks of the campaign to paint Mr. Bush as naive and inexperienced in foreign affairs and to argue that his policies would harm American interests abroad.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I believe it demonstrates a lack of judgment and a complete misunderstanding of history to think that America can simply walk away from security challenges on the European Continent, which is, after all, a core American interest in the world,'' Mr. Gore said of the Bush campaign proposal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the interview after his speech, Mr. Gore said that withdrawing from the peacekeeping operation in the Balkans could cause a questioning of American leadership of NATO and that the lack of American leadership over time ''would lead to the collapse of NATO and eventually threaten the peace in Europe.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But while Mr. Gore seemed more focused on the future and the long-term implications on NATO of an American withdraw from the Balkans peacekeeping force, Dr. Albright concentrated on how floating what she called an ill-conceived idea would affect diplomatic affairs in the shorter term.

Photo opportunities are staged in factories filled with heavy machinery. At a rally this morning in Plymouth, Mich., he posed for a picture with a group of men in leather motorcycle jackets and chaps, who brought signs reading ''Bikers for Bush-Cheney.'' This is a macho campaign.

  Dick Cheney has not kissed Oprah, chatted up Regis or schmoozed with Rosie O'Donnell. In the great tradition of vice-presidential candidates, who have long been used to rally their party's political bases, Mr. Cheney seems to be shoring up the support of one of Gov. George W. Bush's most vital voting blocs: men.

  Mr. Cheney likes college football, too. He tailgated at the Iowa State-Nebraska game a few weeks ago, eating a beef burger and chatting gamely with quite a few inebriated fans. And today, the candidate stopped here for the game between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. He joined tailgaters in the parking lot, putting his foot up on a beer keg and eating a bratwurst with mustard. Supporters chanted ''Football fans for Bush'' and ''Tailgaters for Cheney.''

  That was after he took a brief bus tour through the state with another alpha male: John McCain, the Arizona senator and Vietnam war hero.  ''I know of no man who knows the military better, who understands the needs, who has a better strategic grasp of our national security challenges then Dick Cheney, my friends,'' said Mr. McCain, the erstwhile foe of Mr. Bush but now a supporter.

  Many of Mr. Cheney's campaign stops would seemingly do little to close the gender gap, in which men are for Mr. Bush and women for Mr. Gore. While Mr. Cheney did take a break earlier this month to pick up one of his granddaughters from soccer practice, he has not gone out of his way to make a pitch to the soccer-mom crowd. On the trail, his wife often plays that role, telling audiences that the women in his life are grateful that he views cooking as ''an honorable male occupation.''

  PAYING off the national debt has been elevated to an obsession. Politics does that. Vice President Al Gore, in the presidential debate last Tuesday, solemnly promised millions of Americans that he would ''eliminate the debt in the next decade.'' So would Gov. George W. Bush. And in their unanimity, they deprive the country of a necessary debate on a crucial question: Is zero national debt healthy for the economy?

  Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, in fact, stump for such alternatives. They would devote big chunks of the projected $4.6 trillion in surpluses over 10 years to spending programs and tax cuts. But in their reverence for paying off the debt, they never ask whether it makes sense, given the high potential return from alternatives.

  Gore officials said that they would double their spending on television advertisements to $4 million next week, and match the Republicans in television spending for the rest of the campaign. They said their commercials would amplify the idea that Mr. Bush was not ''up to the job'' of being president.
 </textdata>

  The Bush camp, meanwhile, expanded its purchases of advertising time into two new states: Mr. Gore's home state of Tennessee and Minnesota. Bush aides said today that they were so confident of winning Louisiana and Ohio that they would cut back on advertising there. And a buoyant Mr. Bush even predicted today, ''We have a solid chance to sweep the West Coast.''

  In New Orleans this morning, Mr. Gore said he was not giving up on Louisiana despite polls that showed Mr. Bush with a lead. The vice president sought to ensure a solid turnout from black voters in the state, meeting with black ministers and saying, ''This election is not only about the economy, but it's about values.'' And he emphasized Social Security, arguing that keeping promises on issues like Social Security demonstrate the character of a campaign.

  Later, in Washington, D.C., Mr. Gore called on organized labor for help. ''I want you to campaign like we were one vote behind in every precinct,'' he told supporters from the 1.4-million-member Service Employees International Union in a get-out-the-vote rally. The event was linked by satellite to 17 similar events around the country.

  Mr. Bush made his own pitch in a speech by satellite from his Texas ranch to supporters in Spokane and  Seattle who were organizing a get-out-the-vote drive. Washington has voted for the Democrats in recent presidential elections, but the Bush campaign is fighting to win there.

  Mr. Bush sharply contrasted his agenda with Mr. Gore's. ''We are not just opposing the current administration,'' he said. ''We are proposing something better. For over a year we have been applying creative conservative ideas to the job of helping real people and that is the meaning of compassionate conservatism. And that is the message of my campaign. And that is a cause worth waging.''

  Mr. Bush most pointedly focused  on Mr. Gore's proposal for nearly $500 billion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, mostly targeted for specific needs like college education, child care or retirement savings.
 </textdata>

  10-22-2000

 <textdata>
  ''You might call it an iffy tax scheme,'' Mr. Bush said. ''You can get a tax cut if you do everything Al Gore wants you to do. And that is the kind of meddling, overbearing government you're going to get if you vote for Al Gore.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush's phrase was a play on Mr. Gore's own charge that Mr. Bush's sweeping $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut was a ''risky scheme.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also fought back on the issue of Social Security, saying that Mr. Gore ignored the fiscal problems facing the retirement system when the baby-boom generation retires. ''Social Security has long-term financial problems,'' Mr. Bush said. ''His plan does nothing to address them.'' He argued that Mr. Gore's proposal to add a new retirement savings plan for the middle class on top of traditional Social Security would lead to ''Social Security plus massive government debt. Social Security plus a staggering tax increase.''

  The Democrats' advertising drive begins today with the latest commercials in a series that accuse Mr. Bush of promising the same $1 trillion in Social Security revenue to young adults to invest on their own and current retirees. The Bush campaign disputes that charge, but the Democrats are taking advantage of ambiguities caused by the fact that Mr. Bush has never presented a detailed plan but only overall principles for individual accounts.

  Tad Devine, a Gore strategist, said the campaign would use questions about Mr. Bush's Social Security plan to raise doubts about Mr. Bush's  qualifications to be president. ''There are some serious doubts about whether he is up to the job,'' Mr. Devine said, adding that Social Security ''focuses those doubts.''

  The Bush campaign released two  30-second television advertisements of its own that were to run in 19 hotly contested states. Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said that the scope of the purchase represented an ''expanded battlefield'' and that for the first time Tennessee and Minnesota were being included as states Mr. Bush might win.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aimed at parents and women, the advertisements both showed Mr. Bush in an open necked green shirt, tie less and talking about child-rearing and education. Each is filled with color pictures of children of all races, at play or at school. Speaking of raising school standards, Mr. Bush says in one advertisement: ''It's easy to just spend more. Let's start by expecting more.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The second advertisement is focused on cultural values, and promises Internet filtering devices, character education in the schools and more effective drug prevention and school discipline.

  My solution is, perversely, to vote for a third-party candidate only where he can't win. If you live in Texas, where Bush is way ahead, or in New York, where Gore has a solid lead, you can vote for your third-party candidate without fear of tilting the race to the big-party candidate you dread.

  True, Mr. Gore didn't invent the Internet -- but then, he never said he had. What he did say was, ''During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.'' That was a deeply unfortunate sentence -- but what makes it so unfortunate is that now it is impossible for Mr. Gore to get the credit he actually deserves. Declan McCullagh, the Wired writer who first played up Mr. Gore's remark, puts it this way: the vice president ''was one of the first politicians to realize that those bearded, bespectacled researchers were busy crafting something that could, just maybe, become pretty important.''

  For what it's worth, tech-sector C.E.O.'s seem to be divided about evenly between Messrs. Gore and Bush. That is a sharp contrast with C.E.O.'s at large, who overwhelmingly favor Mr. Bush -- a preference cynics might attribute to the large personal gains that people with seven- or eight-figure incomes would receive from that tax cut.

  But while I have the horrifying suspicion that Mr. Gore has heard of endogenous growth theory, and would actually enjoy talking about it,  this is not what Mr. Bush had in mind. In context, it's pretty clear he meant that Mr. Gore is an old-economy fuddy-duddy because he insists that you can't spend the same money twice -- that you can't divert Social Security taxes into individual accounts for young workers and use that same money to pay benefits to their parents.

  The independent groups are using some of the toughest oratory in this otherwise relatively tame campaign. At get-out-the-vote rallies in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia, for example, Charlton Heston, the president of the National Rifle Association, has called this the most important election ''since the Civil War'' and said that Mr. Gore would appoint Supreme Court justices who will ''hammer your gun rights into oblivion.'' He even suggested that a ''lynching mob'' might be the best response to Mr. Gore's gun-control fervor.

  Other groups, while less inflammatory, are also resorting to harsh attacks on their opponents and their ideas. Union organizers are distributing leaflets that accuse Mr. Bush of trying to take away union pensions in Texas. Abortion opponents have been carrying huge photographs of bloody aborted fetuses to Democratic rallies. And abortion-rights advocates are mailing glossy fliers that say, ''If Bush decides, legal abortion could be banned and women will again die in dangerous back-alley abortions.''

  The national office of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has created a Web site for its organizers to mass-produce customized fliers that compare Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush on major issues. The site allows union locals to type in messages from their leaders, with their logos. The four-color fliers are then printed by the national office and bulk-mailed within a day.

  The league has compiled a list of 170,000 Missouri voters who support abortion rights, many of whom are Republicans and independents. The group's goal is to call most of those voters by Election Day and deliver this message, ''George W. Bush wants to criminalize abortion,'' Ms. Fields said.

  As he runs for president, Mr. Bush has turned for advice not just to campaign consultants and briefing books, but also to preachers and Bible passages.

  When faced with doubts or challenges, Mr. Bush has often in recent years turned toward religion for guidance, confidence and comfort. That is the portrait that has emerged from interviews with friends, the evangelical pastors he has cultivated and the minister of the Methodist church he belongs to in Dallas. They regard his public references to Christ during the campaign as the sincere confessions of an enthusiastic convert, and not as mere posturing.

  They do not, however, paint him as a choirboy. In fact, they say he turned to God to cope with his own sin. Mr. Bush himself, when asked in interviews about his faith, has for years volunteered the same Bible verse about sin and hypocrisy.

  Like some kind of religious Rorschach, Mr. Bush has managed to allow spiritual leaders to see in him whatever image of Christianity they prefer. His mainline Methodist minister says he is a nondogmatic moderate. Conservative Southern Baptists see in him a fellow believer in moral absolutes. Charles W. Colson, a Watergate felon turned born-again evangelist, said in an interview that Mr. Bush was ''one of us.''

  Mr. Bush's father was an Episcopalian, his mother a Presbyterian, and as a child, Mr. Bush attended churches of both denominations. When Mr. Bush married Laura Welch at the age of 31, he joined a Methodist church, and he has remained a Methodist.

  Methodist churches run the gamut from liberal to conservative, depending on the congregation. The congregation where the Bushes found a home, and where they maintain their membership, is Highland Park United Methodist Church in Dallas, where they lived while Mr. Bush owned the Texas Rangers baseball team just before he ran for governor. Mr. and Mrs. Bush regularly sat in the same pew near the pulpit in the transept, next to the door, while their twin daughters attended the Sunday school.

  The church, adjacent to the campus of Southern Methodist University, is in a leafy neighborhood of stately brick homes. The congregation leans Republican and includes more than 200 corporate leaders. But last Sunday, cars in the parking lot sported bumper stickers for the Gore-Lieberman ticket, as well as for Mr. Bush, and the half a dozen stickers about abortion supported abortion rights.

  ''This church is middle of the road,'' Mr. Craig said. ''It's a very traditional, very open and accepting church, and it is where Mr. Bush wanted to be. I think he is a moderate. I have no fear of him becoming more dogmatic.''

  When Mr. Bush was elected to his second term as governor in 1998, he asked Mr. Craig to preach at the prayer service the morning of the inauguration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Craig's sermon ''reached out and grabbed me, and changed my life,'' Mr. Bush wrote in his official autobiography, ''A Charge To Keep'' (William Morrow, 1999). Mr. Craig preached about Moses, the reluctant leader, and said that people were ''starved for leadership.'' Mr. Bush wrote that his mother, listening in the pews, later told him that the minister was ''talking to you.'' Mr. Bush attributes his decision to run for president to the sermon that his minister preached that day.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush told other ministers that their prayers had given him the peace of mind to run for president. Before the inauguration in January 1999, Mr. Bush met with a group of ministers at the Fellowship Church in Grapevine, Tex., a fast-growing megachurch loosely affiliated with the Southern Baptists.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000

 <textdata>
  They stood in a circle around him, laid their hands on his body, and prayed for him, the ministers recalled. When they finished, Mr. Bush's eyes were filled with tears, several ministers said.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush recounted for them the story he often tells about how he turned to Jesus Christ in 1986, when he was 40. He says he was drinking too much, allowing his marriage to go stale, and adrift in his job. That summer, at his parents' summer house in Kennebunkport, Me., he took a walk with Mr. Graham, an old family friend.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In interviews earlier this year, neither man could remember the content of the conversation. But Mr. Bush, and friends who knew him at the time, say that he returned home to Texas resolved to quit drinking and turn his life around.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He wanted to know more,'' Mr. Graham said, ''about what it means to be a Christian, to be a moral leader, and he always impressed me as a man that had his goal of being something more than just the son of George Bush.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said that Billy Graham ''planted the seed.'' He said that was the day he decided to ''recommit my heart'' to Jesus Christ.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Those who know him say Mr. Bush goes through phases when he forsakes Bible reading. But in the last year, he has begun reading the ''one-year'' Bible, 365 brief portions that can each be read in a few minutes daily.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked whether he regards the Bible as the literal and inerrant word of God, Mr. Bush said in the earlier interview: ''From Scripture you can gain a lot of strength and solace and learn life's lessons. That's what I believe, and I don't necessarily believe every single word is literally true.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000

  Mr. Bush learned a lesson from his first campaign for governor, when he created a controversy by telling an Austin reporter that only those who have accepted Christ as their savior can enter the kingdom of heaven.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''I want to win,'' Mr. Bush said in the interview, ''and I'm a tough competitor, but I also understand that winning this election may not be in the larger plan of things. I think it will be, but it may not be. Prayer helps me keep perspective.''

  ''I had a real smorgasbord of religious experiences,'' Mr. Gore said in a recent interview about his faith. ''On Sundays in Washington I'd go to the Presbyterian Church around the corner from the Fairfax,'' the hotel where his family lived during the school year, ''and in Carthage we'd alternate between my mother's Church of Christ and my father's Baptist church. Except when we went to the Methodist church.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has continued to branch out over the years, too, studying mysticism as well as ethics, his primary focus during three semesters at Vanderbilt Divinity School, and at least toying with New Age ideas. He also took a course called Theology and the Natural Sciences and, over time, came to see environmentalism as a religious obligation to protect creation. His 1992 book about the environment, ''Earth in the Balance,'' is suffused with ecospirituality. And clearly, his faith is still in flux.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, said his spiritual search reminded her of the year he spent trying to decide whether to enlist in the Army. ''I remember hearing about the way he was thinking about going to Vietnam, and there's a similar strain in how he's open to religious faith,'' she said. ''There's a discomfort with being so sure about something. I see him searching, seeking and striving and don't see his faith as static.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By definition, of course, religious belief is interior, personal, not necessarily a matter shared easily or even at all. But when Mr. Gore talks of his faith he is not so much reticent -- though he is that, too, sometimes -- as he is restless, unfinished.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Though she sees the fact that he is still seeking as evidence of his openness, flexibility and tolerance, it might just as easily come across as another way in which Mr. Gore seems like a 52-year-old man who does not yet fully know himself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although Mr. Gore considers himself a born-again Christian, among even close friends there is some difference of opinion about whether he is a believer or someone who believes in believing, who respects and admires faith in God but finds the required leap outside his head a long, long way to go.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Hard as it is to draw many straight lines between Mr. Gore's religious views and his public life, the one public policy exception, the single place where Mr. Gore does seem to see an explicit link between God and government, is the environment. This, for him, is where God and science seem to meet. Should Mr. Gore lose in November, Ms. Schiff said, ''I could see him pursuing environmentalism and theology in some way.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked if he believed in a literal interpretation of the Bible, Mr. Gore paused, took a moment and then said, ''Well, I don't believe in the literal interpretation of the word 'literally.' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Everything in the Bible makes sense to me,'' Mr. Gore went on. ''I interpret it my own way, and that's what my tradition teaches me to do. There are poetic passages that speak eloquently to me with meanings that transcend the literal words. In Genesis, for example, God creates this, that and the other in one day, two days, and that represents an order in creation that's perfectly evident to my heart.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Moderate Baptists like Mr. Gore generally do not take the Bible literally. But he seems conflicted, if not about his beliefs then certainly over how to talk about them. He readily agreed to be interviewed about his faith. Yet in the interview, he said he felt he had to be careful.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Al Gore did not inherit his faith from his parents, but came to it on his own. His mother, Pauline LaFon Gore, and his father, the senator, were ''turned off'' to organized religion, according to Ms. Schiff.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Right after his college graduation in 1969, he went into the Army. And he apparently did, as he said, drift a bit. Marny Hendrick, who worked and shared a barracks with him at Fort Rucker, Ala., said, laughing: ''I don't ever remember the conversation going that way. We were 20 and 21, classically unchurched. I don't think we had a Bible in the room.'' Though most of them, Mr. Gore included, were headed to Vietnam, Mr. Hendrick said, ''We approached it more from a political standpoint.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When he got back from Vietnam, however, Mr. Gore headed straight to Vanderbilt Divinity School, where he studied for a little over a year. He has said he was struggling to make sense of the war and the morality of his role in it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the former dean of the divinity school, Walter Harrelson, now retired, said he thought Mr. Gore had more practical motivations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He was taking stock, and the divinity school at that time was full of such people, but it never seemed to me he came with existential angst; he was much more self-possessed than that,'' said Mr. Harrelson, who also got to know Mr. Gore socially.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was much taken with this, Mr. Harrelson said, and sat in on his course on the prophets, where he appeared fascinated by the stories of Amos and Hosea and Micah and their concern for the oppressed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At around the same time he was pursuing graduate-level theological studies, in his early 20's, Mr. Gore became a born-again Christian.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When first asked if he considers himself born again, Mr. Gore said, ''I never talk about that unless I'm asked a direct question with the use of that phrase, because people have a lot of meanings they attach to that phrase.'' Then he waited to be asked the direct question, again, before saying, ''Yes, I do.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said that when he and his family moved to Arlington, Va., in 1977, after he was first elected to Congress, Karenna, then 4, cried that she did not like the Episcopal church they tried attending. ''I want Brother Gibbs,'' she said tearfully, according to her father. (''I still kind of like those eye-popping sermons,'' Ms. Schiff says now.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So they tried to accommodate her, he said, and switched to Mount Vernon Baptist, a small faith community near the Pentagon, where the congregation is relatively transient. That is where both Al and Tipper Gore were baptized by full immersion in the late 1970's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At least for a while, Mr. Gore was also a member of a small prayer group on Capitol Hill, where men read the Bible together and called one another to account when necessary. He would not talk about this either, other than to confirm that he took part and say that he got a lot out of it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But he has often said he leaned heavily on church friends and fellow believers when his son, 6-year-old Albert Gore III, was hit by a car in 1989. According to several friends, Mr. Gore absolutely believes that God saved his son and that the power of prayer helped heal him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was that crisis that prompted Mr. Gore to write ''Earth in the Balance,'' an environmental book full of spiritual references. Initially, he had envisioned an even more religious book. ''I had some concern about this,'' said his editor, John Sterling. ''How do we present this book seriously if we work a lot of spiritual stuff in?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Though Mr. Sterling said he did his best to rein in that impulse, God remained a main character in the book. In it, Mr. Gore explains why, for him, God and environmentalism are inextricably linked: ''How can one glorify the Creator while heaping contempt on creation? How can one walk humbly with nature's God while wreaking havoc on nature?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It is my own belief that the image of God can be seen in every corner of creation, even in us, but only faintly,'' Mr. Gore wrote, in what seems to be as close to a statement of core religious belief as anything else he has ever said or written. ''By experiencing nature in its fullest -- our own and that of all creation -- with our senses and with our spiritual imagination, we can glimpse, 'bright shining as the sun,' an infinite image of God.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has not been active in church for a decade, and acknowledges a new distance from his larger faith community. The once liberal Southern Baptist Convention, which filed briefs in Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade and opposed the war in Vietnam, has more recently been dominated by fundamentalists, leaving moderates like Mr. Gore in the clear minority. Just last week, Jimmy Carter left the Southern Baptist Convention, saying he felt excluded by the adoption of ''increasingly rigid'' policies, including its declaration two years ago that women should be subservient to their husbands.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore says he often turns to the Bible for answers to some of life's hardest questions. He did that, he said, after the Columbine High School shootings in Colorado.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I read again the account of Cain slaying Abel,'' Mr. Gore said. As he began quoting from Genesis, he asked his interviewer to follow along -- ''Do you have your Bible?'' -- as he told the story of Cain, whose gift to God was rejected, killing his brother Abel, whose gift was accepted.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If you do well, you will be accepted,'' Mr. Gore quoted from memory. ''If you do not do well, sin croucheth at your door . . . and thou shalt rule over'' sin. ''Now, here's how I read it,'' he went on, talking about the young men responsible for the Columbine killings. ''Those two boys in trench coats felt like what they had to offer in life was being rejected, and that made them vulnerable to sin.'' They still failed, though, he said, ''in their duty to rule over it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's friend and mentor Mr. Peretz had already mentioned a discussion he had had with Mr. Gore about this very passage -- and his own question about whether God had been wrong to have refused Cain's gift in the first place. Why had God preferred Abel's live offering, an animal sacrifice, to Cain's fruits of the field?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the current campaign, Mr. Gore has talked about God sparingly, and, though he did quote from the book of Matthew in one debate, certainly less frequently than either his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, or his own running mate, Mr. Lieberman.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When asked, though, how he had reacted when Mr. Bush answered a question in a debate during primary season by saying that his favorite philosopher-thinker was Jesus, Mr. Gore said: ''I wasn't discomfited by his answer. I don't think of Christ first and foremost as a philosopher, but it's a perfectly good answer.''

  ''The governor has not gotten involved in the maneuvering or negotiations with any specific immigration bills,'' said Ray Sullivan, a Bush campaign spokesman. ''The governor has said he does not support a blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants at this time.''
 </textdata>

  10-22-2000

  But another Bush adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed concern that the issue could backfire on Republicans, adding, ''We're trying to find a way to do this without making it a political issue.''

  ''I thought he literally was going to hit him,'' Barbara Bush said on the campaign trail last week after the final of the three presidential forums, a town hall meeting in St. Louis.

  After the debate, Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas resumed their transcontinental quests to win over the undecideds and persuade the ''persuadables,'' those waffling potential voters who are recruited by the news shows to fill the seats in their on-air focus groups.

  Each candidate was taking sharper aim at his rival. The Democrats ran new ads attacking Mr. Bush's environmental and education record in Texas. The Republicans replied with new spots labeling Mr. Gore a spendthrift who will rapidly run through the surplus.

  Al Gore and George Bush have the same challenge: to appeal to a base by presenting sharply contrasting visions of the role of government, while also appealing to independent voters by playing down these differences. In reality, Mr. Bush is a conservative who would cut taxes and limit government and Mr. Gore offers popular entitlements, like prescription drug coverage and tuition tax breaks, in line with his party's traditional liberalism.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet many of the independent, undecided voters interviewed after the debates saw little difference between them. Those who did seemed confused, like the woman who favored gun control and abortion, yet still preferred Mr. Bush. Still others talked of how unhappy they were with both men, when what they really seemed to be saying was that they were prepared to hold out, hoping the candidates would tailor positions just for them. The phenomenon of myopic self-interest was captured in the third debate by a woman who asked not about the candidate's foreign policy, Supreme Court justices or the role of government, but about how the candidate's tax plans would help her as a single person with no dependents.
 </textdata>

  Indeed, both candidates seem to assume that viewers sit in front of their TV screens with ''The Almanac of American Politics'' on their laps. Mr. Gore demonstrated his command of the Dingell-Norwood bill (in the third debate), while Mr. Bush spoke about how much he spent in Texas on the CHIPs program (in the second). No viewers, no matter how good their math or how keen their interest, could follow each man's defense of his tax program. Partisanship distills information. Independence disperses it.

  It may be the candidates' own fault. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have so narrow-casted their message to a sliver of voters in swing states crucial for an electoral college victory that they have deserted the rest.  Meanwhile, those in the sights of the candidates -- in fierce battlegrounds like here in Michigan -- seem to yearn for candidates who can stir more passion.

  Rather than talk about the merits of Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, two patrons at Dawn Donuts in Saginaw (''101 Delicious Varieties''), a Democrat and a Republican, lamented last week about how they missed a politician like Ronald Reagan.

  What the candidates are talking about seems only to accentuate their similarities. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have strikingly different philosophies and stands on everything ranging from abortion to the role of government to the Supreme Court to gun laws. Yet, in the candidates' determination to be all things to all voters, it is hardly surprising that voters cannot tell the two apart (even when they are not standing side-by-side wearing red ties).
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-22-2000

 <textdata>
  Gun control seemed a natural this year for the Democrats. But the vice president has largely stayed clear of the issue because polls suggest it will not win him any votes among undecided voters in swing states. Same with capital punishment. Both candidates favor it, but Mr. Gore has not even probed Mr. Bush's potential vulnerability by addressing racial disparities and other issues the death penalty underscores.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  An obvious explanation is that in blissful economic times, voters never have much taste for politics. That is especially true when no war-and-peace issues are brewing. In 1960, voters seemed riveted by the presidential campaign not because the economy was in the tank (it wasn't) but because there were weighty matters at stake. Somehow, the tussle over whether Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush would offer more generous prescription drug benefits does not seem on par with the space race or the missile gap.

  Even the impressive early rallying around Mr. Bush before the primaries seemed motivated not so much by Bush the man (many of his early supporters had never met him) but by Bush the man who has the best shot at returning his party to the White House.

  In interview after interview in battleground states, even people who said they are interested enough to vote admitted they were not enthralled with Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore.

  The difficulty with this election is Al Gore is not quite an incumbent. And you have an election where many more people think the country is moving in the right direction. This is not a ''throw the bums out election.'' People would like to preserve a lot of what's going right and so it's complex to gauge the undecideds.  The problem is not the accuracy of polls. The problem is interpreting them.

  A. I don't believe in doing just polls. I always do focus groups. In a  presidential campaign you poll quite regularly. We'll do two or three national polls a week. In addition to that every night we'll have focus groups. We bring a couple of groups of 10 people together in a room. Usually  they are people who are like-minded and undecided, people who say they are Bush voters and who say they are open to Gore. People who are the  kind of voters we need to reach. Also demographically similar so that they  are comfortable. We don't mix post graduates with high school graduates because the post graduates will dominate and there will be a kind of  deference to them on issues that they don't deserve. We have demographic  homogeneity so people are comfortable. I always separate women from men so women can bond to each other faster. These sessions last two hours maximum.

  For Harris, the campaign was winding down; for Roe, the toughest period lay ahead. The Rogan campaign was facing some tactical questions. The candidate was getting pounded with commercials paid for by the Democrats, and his own spots did not seem to be doing him much good. Like Rogan, Roe was disappointed that George W. Bush had not picked McCain, who remained popular in California, as his running mate. If he had, Roe thought, the race would be over.

  Schiff fits an emerging mold of politician, post-Gingrich and even post-Clinton, a type whose traits are exemplified in turns by George W. Bush and Al Gore. When it comes to politics, they are sophisticated enough, like Bush, not to talk much about how sophisticated they are; they deliver the good news with a grin, the attacks almost as amiably and the bad news rarely, if at all. When it comes to policy, they are mechanics, like Gore, rather than architects; they present themselves as unglamorous, hard-working public servants, on contract for a job. At the Congressional level, their watchwords are bipartisanship and constituent service, and they mean both.

  'The next president is going to appoint three, maybe even four, justices of the Supreme Court,'' Al Gore declared in a moment of enthusiasm during the first presidential debate. But Gore and George W. Bush said little about their visions of the court, except to dance around the one question that has obsessed presidential candidates since 1980. ''The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision's going to be overturned,'' the vice president announced. ''This is a very important issue, because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted, and it could be lost.'' Bush countered with echoes of Richard Nixon's campaign rhetoric from 1968. He promised to appoint judges ''who will strictly interpret the Constitution,'' as opposed to ''liberal, activist judges who will use their bench to subvert the legislature.''

  In fact, both candidates are repeating slogans from old debates that may not turn out to be central during the next four years. Consider abortion. There are now six justices on the court who support the core principle of Roe v. Wade -- namely, that abortions can't be banned before fetal viability. Only three justices believe, as Justice Antonin Scalia declared as recently as June, that Roe ''must be overruled.'' For Roe to be overturned, Bush would have to replace two pro-Roe justices -- say, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor -- with two committed anti-Roe justices. Given the uncertainties of Supreme Court retirements, he might not have this opportunity. What's more, overturning Roe wouldn't lead to a national ban on abortion. Although some state legislatures would vote to restrict abortion, many would maintain the status quo.

  The word ''federalism'' tends to make most people's eyes glaze over. But although the issue gets less attention than affirmative action and abortion, it is no less important. During the past five years, the Supreme Court has struck down all or part of 25 federal laws, from the line-item veto to the Brady gun-control law. In many of these cases, the court decided -- by slim 5-to-4 margins -- that Congress or the president had encroached on states' rights or on the separation of powers. The election of 2000, therefore, could redefine the shape of the federal government. If Gore wins, the court might well abandon its recent attempts to impose meaningful limits on Congress's power. If Bush wins, however, the court could embark on a concerted attempt to roll back the boundaries of the modern regulatory state.

  Many people are familiar by now with the constitutional arguments for and against legalized abortion and affirmative action. But the debate over federalism tends to be too abstract to get even the hearts of lawyers pounding. In the hope of making the issue more concrete, I visited two judges who have written influential opinions on opposite sides of the debate: J. Michael Luttig, an appellate judge in Virginia; and David S. Tatel, an appellate judge in Washington. This choice of judges was not made casually. Luttig is considered a leading candidate for a Supreme Court appointment in a Bush administration; Tatel is among those who are similarly well regarded by the Gore camp. Conversations with each of them, therefore, offer insights into the very different directions the Supreme Court could take in a Bush or Gore administration.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Having read Luttig's opinions, which display a relish for eviscerating the logical flaws of his colleagues, I was surprised and charmed by his self-deprecating friendliness and emotional accessibility. He is an extremely likable man. Unlike Justice Scalia, for whom he clerked, Luttig is intelligent without being a showoff. Born and reared in Texas, he has a down-home unpretentiousness that might very well appeal to George W. Bush.

  Luttig, 46, showed me around his chambers on the ninth floor of the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va., which are adorned with autographed pictures of Supreme Court justices featuring unusually intimate inscriptions. As a Department of Justice official in the Bush administration, Luttig worked tirelessly for the confirmation of David Souter in 1990 and Clarence Thomas in 1991. Thomas's gratitude is evident in several pictures, one of which shows him in shirt sleeves with his arm around Luttig's shoulder. Another picture has an inscription from ''Clarence,'' which reads: ''This would not have been possible without you! Thanks so much, buddy!''

  Luttig's speedy progress from law clerk for Chief Justice Warren E. Burger to White House aide to federal appellate judge -- he was appointed by President Bush at the improbable age of 36 -- has given his opinions a confident, relentlessly logical quality, like those of a bright, young law professor who has never been chastened by life outside the academy. Luttig, who studied Ludwig Wittgenstein in college, is known for making mathematically precise arguments, especially in cases involving the limits of federal power.

  In a concurring opinion, Luttig's colleague J. Harvie Wilkinson 3rd reflected on the dangers of what he candidly called ''judicial activism'' by conservatives. Wilkinson, a well-respected moderate conservative, is himself mentioned as a leading Supreme Court candidate in a Bush administration. A former law professor and newspaper editor in Virginia, Wilkinson argued that any time courts refuse to defer to the decisions of legislative bodies, their decisions must be called activist. But he insisted that the Supreme Court's recent decisions limiting the scope of federal power were more defensible than than those of previous eras of judicial activism, the 1930's and 1960's, because the court was merely acting as a ''structural referee'' between federal and state governments. Looking to the future, however, Wilkinson cautioned that ''if modern activism accelerates to a gallop'' -- leading to a ''wholesale invalidation of environmental, civil rights and business regulation'' -- then the new conservative judicial activists would be just as discredited as their predecessors.

  If Bush judges are likely to question the scope of federal power, Gore judges are not. Although Gore has indicated that he would appoint liberal justices like Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan, it is not yet clear if Gore is more willing than President Clinton to expend significant political capital to appoint judicial liberals rather than judicial moderates. At the very least, however, it seems probable that Gore justices, like the moderate Clinton appointees Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, would share a distaste for sweeping exercises of judicial power and a reluctance to strike down federal laws in the name of states' rights. One judicial moderate who fits this mold is David Tatel, appointed by Clinton to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

The Energizer bunny interrupts a mock political ad in which the surprised candidate -- pontificating, with a playground as a backdrop --is accidentally knocked over by a child on a swing.

  Mr. Bush's idea comes at a time when Kosovo, which is run by the United Nations but patrolled by NATO-led troops, is facing a difficult and even explosive period with the fall from power of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. Kosovo Albanians' desires for independence seem farther away than before, and yet they trust Washington and American troops more than the Europeans, whom they see as pro-Serb.

  When questioned, no NATO government -- including the British, French and Italians -- would provide any official reaction, given the prominence Ms. Rice's comments have been given in the endgame of the American presidential campaign. The Democratic candidate, Al Gore, supported by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, moved quickly to use the Rice comments to try to cast doubt on the fitness of Mr. Bush to be president.
 </textdata>

  Still, the Bush-Rice proposal is not new, but an extension of a doctrine put forth by Gen. Colin L. Powell under the last Republican president, Mr. Bush's father. General Powell's belief was that American troops would essentially be reserved for a real crisis where overwhelming force could be brought to bear, to ensure victory and limit casualties.

  Lord Robertson, the NATO secretary general, has regularly told visiting American congressmen that the Bush proposal could undermine the whole idea of ''risk sharing, which is precisely the glue that holds the alliance together,'' one NATO official said. ''That's where we went wrong in Bosnia, and having corrected that error, it would be tragic to go back.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000

 <textdata>
  In this sense, there is an opening for the Bush desire to hand over peace maintenance duties to the Europeans. Already, in Bosnia and Kosovo, American troops are no more than 20 percent of the total, and under 15 percent in Kosovo alone. American aid represents no more than 20 percent of what is being provided in Bosnia and Kosovo.

  In Yugoslavia itself, Predrag Simic, an adviser on foreign affairs to the Serbian Renewal Movement, said that Mr. Bush's proposal is ''another indication of American capriciousness in foreign affairs'' and will only give the Kosovar Albanians a ''new pretext to push for independence as soon as possible.''

  One NATO-country diplomat said that the Bush argument for a better division of labor is a strong one, pointing to the Australian peacekeepers in East Timor, for example. ''But it is simply not realistic in the Balkans. The Americans have national interests in Europe and they play a deterrent role that is irreplaceable. NATO is not in Kosovo for the Kosovars, but for ourselves.''

  For George W. Bush, compassionate conservatism has been a fair-weather campaign theme. When he was dominating the Republican field in 1999, or maintaining a sizable lead over Al Gore most of this summer, Mr. Bush could afford to spend all his time talking about his innovative programs for the poor and what they said about his heart.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush has twice jettisoned compassionate conservatism when sharply challenged. After John McCain defeated him in New Hampshire, he came back as an unmodified conservative, suspicious of federal campaign-finance regulations, disdainful of Washington and eager to cut taxes. He has fought Mr. Gore similarly, running as a reformist outsider against a big-government Democrat.

 <textdata>
  The danger of a candidate's describing himself as compassionate is that it enables his opponents to portray him as self-involved, morally vain and softheaded. Senator McCain attracted many voters because he appeared to be a tough, plainspoken leader. And Mr. Bush, as long as he was promising to be a uniter, not a divider, and to touch every willing heart, didn't have that appearance. Nor could he refute Mr. Gore's contention that he was running on a warm and fuzzy personality rather than on ideas that would benefit the public.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Of course Mr. Bush all along presented his political philosophy, and not just himself, as compassionate. But that didn't work, either. Conservatism practically begins with the fear that the attempt to express compassion through the state is likely to backfire. It insists instead on the importance of judgment in moral matters and self-reliance in economic ones. Both virtues are in tension with compassion, and even more with the sentimentality that often mistakes itself for compassion. People sense all this instinctively, and recent surveys show that the public considers Mr. Bush no more compassionate than any other Republican and thinks he ''cares'' less about people than Mr. Gore does.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Compassionate conservatism fails, finally, as a political strategy. It might have worked if the public were so eager to leave the Clinton years behind that it would vote for any reasonably competent Republican who showed that he didn't have fangs. There was no shortage of would-be strategists who believed that the weariness with President Clinton did go that far. But especially after Mr. Gore established himself as his own man at the Democratic Convention, it became necessary for Mr. Bush to advance a more compelling argument.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Since Labor Day, he has been doing that. He has not stopped claiming that as president he would govern with the interests of all Americans, including minorities and the poor, in mind; nor should he. But he has also made the argument, much more clearly than in the past, that he would serve the values and interests of the middle class better than Mr. Gore would. And those values and interests point toward a smaller federal government.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000

 <textdata>
  So do those of the successful Americans Mr. Gore denigrates as the wealthy. In the national elections in 1998, Republicans lost crucial ground among people in households making more than $75,000 a year -- a quarter of the electorate that year. Now, according to at least one poll, Mr. Bush is winning their votes by 23 points.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If Mr. Bush is elected, it will not be primarily because of his personality, compassionate or otherwise. It will be because America remains, in crucial respects, a conservative country that wants energetic conservative leaders. Mr. Bush would be wise to remember that, should he move to the White House. After a tumultuous year, he surely appreciates a bedrock truth of conservatism: It's not always fair weather.

  In 1992, Ross Perot won more than 25 percent of the vote for president in some counties in the area. No one has tabulated who won along the corridor in the last two presidential elections, because there is no consensus on exactly which communities to count and which to exclude.

 <textdata>
  Outside a suburban Chicago middle school where Mr. Bush campaigned today, Karen P. Hughes, the campaign communications director, called the new findings biased and ''dead wrong.'' Ms. Hughes noted that other studies, including a larger July report by RAND, have portrayed Texas students in a good light, particularly in math.

  In an unusual step, RAND's president and chief executive, James A. Thomson, citing the ''intense controversy, as we expected,'' issued a statement endorsing the findings in the study released today and the July report cited by the Bush campaign. In doing so, he rebutted Ms. Hughes's claim that the July report officially carried the RAND imprimatur but not today's smaller study, which is technically called an Issue Paper.

  The study found that in many categories, Texas students ranked high nationally, particularly in fourth-grade math. In fact, black fourth graders in Texas made bigger gains than their peers in every state on the math portion of the national test in 1996, according to the Grissmer study. The Bush campaign immediately embraced the findings. Laura Bush even mentioned the study in her address to the Republican National Convention.

Relatives of the officer, Hailoon Wang, live on the first floor, and the two families have feuded for about a year and a half, the police said.

  For a president eager to do what he can to help Democrats triumph in November, this budget fight has been a bust. Major clashes have been minimal. Even the many skirmishes ending in White House victories do not seem to provide an appreciable lift to the Gore campaign. White House aides lament that nobody seems to be watching as the president tries one last round of legislative brinkmanship.

  This year, much to the frustration of the White House, the Republican presidential candidate, Gov. George W. Bush, successfully distanced himself from the wrangling on Capitol Hill. And despite White House efforts to use the annual budget standoff to frame the issues in the campaign, the negotiations have so far resulted in little more than a yawn.

  ''It also points up how critical this election is,'' Ms. Lowey said. ''For those who support family planning, it is absolutely essential that we elect Al Gore. And for those who would destroy family planning, then George Bush should be their person.''

  Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, would not speculate on whether Mr. Bush would reinstate the restrictions if he is elected. But as a matter of principle, Mr. Sullivan added, ''Governor Bush does not favor using federal funds for abortion or abortion-related counseling at home or abroad.''

  Vice President Al Gore is in excellent health and has not taken a sick day in eight years in the White House, Mr. Gore and his doctor said in their first full interviews about Mr. Gore's health. Mr. Gore is ''fit for duty,'' Dr. Richard J. Tubb, a White House physician and Mr. Gore's personal doctor since mid-1995, said of his patient on a flight on Air Force Two from Milwaukee to Washington on Oct. 11.

  Turning serious, Mr. Gore said he and Dr. Tubb had discussed the recommended intervals for routine checkups. Mr. Gore's last two checkups were about 18 months apart, on May 7, 1999, and Dec. 23, 1997. Dr. Tubb said he followed general medical guidelines that in recent years have focused more on the timeliness of performing certain screening tests like measuring blood pressure and detecting early colon cancer than on general physical exam.

  ''I opted to go close to the outer boundary because I am involved in a national campaign where every day and every half-day means a lot,'' Mr. Gore said. ''So I don't feel I am sacrificing anything by maximizing all the hours I have between now and Nov. 7.''

  To relieve stress, Mr. Gore said, he exercises, listens to music, prays and meditates. ''If I've got a negotiating session or I have got a meeting that has a very high stakes outcome,'' Mr. Gore said, ''instead of using the last four or five minutes to cram more details into my head, I will just relax and just slow down.''

  He is also a nail-biter. In the interview his nails were bitten to ragged edges. Asked if this was a lifetime habit, Mr. Gore said he did it ''every once in a while'' and did not link it to nervousness or anything else.

  Yesterday, after months of requests, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, said Mr. Bush would permit his doctor to be interviewed by The Times. But the governor has so far declined to be interviewed.

  Every other day, Mr. Gore said, he does a strength workout. ''I do 150 push-ups and 100 sit-ups'' and other exercises, including lifting weights. ''Then,'' he went on, ''I run or sometimes Stairmaster five to six days a week.'' Mr. Gore said he was bad at downhill skiing and mountain climbing, but climbed because it is ''something my son and I can do together.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked whether a president should take the risks of mountain climbing, he said he would not take any that were unreasonable. Climbing can be  ''perfectly reasonable,'' depending on the experience and skill of the climbing party, the mountain, routes taken and weather, Mr. Gore said.

  Mr. Gore and his family went through a terrifying ordeal in 1989 when his 6-year-old son, Albert, was struck by a car and suffered a serious head injury. At the time, they participated in family counseling on the advice of doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital ''because the great stress associated with an incident like that is something that sometimes can affect the entire family,'' Mr. Gore said. Referring to his wife, Mr. Gore went on:

  Mr. Gore said he did not remember the specific details but thought that a psychologist had led the talk. ''It wasn't a psychiatrist,'' but ''it would have been fine if it was,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I am glad that we did it.''

  In discussing Mr. Gore's family medical history, Dr. Tubb said he had not examined Mr. Gore's father, Albert Sr., but he believed that his death at age 90 in 1998 was from complications of Alzheimer's disease. Asked about the possibility his father had Alzheimer's, Mr. Gore rose forward on the couch and expressed surprise, saying, ''He did?''

  Speaking of his father, a former senator from Tennessee, Mr. Gore said, ''There is no doubt that he had some form of dementia before he died, but I really do not know exactly what kind it was.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said he attributed his father's dementia, which he said was present for a year or two before his death, to a severe head injury his father suffered in his late 80's. A bull was acting up and the senior Mr. Gore whacked it on the nose. ''The bull upended him and my father landed on his head,'' Mr. Gore said.

  Mr. Gore's schedule influences how long he sleeps. He works best when he sleeps eight hours, but he usually gets only seven, he said. He catches up by sleeping longer the next night or taking a catnap, and envies others who can take a nap at will. ''I can't,'' Mr. Gore said.

  At his last physical, Mr. Gore stood 6 feet one inch and weighed 195 pounds -- a pound less than when he entered Congress in 1977 and 15 pounds less than his heaviest weight, 210 pounds, in January 1994. Aides said they could not provide a more recent weight.

  Dr. Tubb, a nutritionist and a physiologist jointly recommended that Mr. Gore eat a diet of high complex carbohydrates, low saturated fats and high fiber to control his cholesterol. Mr. Gore said he ''very rarely'' drank alcohol and usually chose his menus. Referring to the salad and baklava that were served on the flight, Mr. Gore said he ate ''only 3 pieces of baklava today instead of the five I wanted.''

  Two weeks before Election Day, Mr. Gore explained his views on government in an address in Little Rock, Ark., the former home of the man who asked him to join his ticket eight years ago. But now fearful of standing beside a tarnished Bill Clinton, Mr. Gore did not invite the president to join him in Little Rock, and he mentioned his name only in passing today.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  The rally at River Market Square in Little Rock was two blocks from the planned site of Mr. Clinton's presidential library. But with national network cameras trained his way, Mr. Gore repeatedly passed up opportunities to pay homage to Mr. Clinton before the home folks, though he did praise other Arkansas politicians in attendance, like former Senator Dale Bumpers and current Senator Blanche Lincoln.

  ''I don't ever want to see another era of big government,'' declared Mr. Gore, the Democratic nominee, echoing Mr. Clinton's 1996 declaration that ''the era of big government is over.'' Mr. Gore added, ''But I certainly don't want to ever see another era of special interests who wield more power than the American people have.''

  Mr. Gore bookended his day with appearances in Mr. Clinton's home state and his own, greeting workers at his national headquarters in Nashville this evening and then attending  fund-raisers here. In between, he held a rally on a steamy airport tarmac in Shreveport, La. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore carried all three states he visited today in 1992 and 1996.

  The vice president hopes to spend the rest of the campaign making the policy distinctions between himself and Mr. Bush as stark as possible, and he began that task with today's address. His goal, he made clear, was to undercut the Republican depiction of him as ''a mythical big-spending, big-government candidate, a cartoon image from campaigns past.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000

 <textdata>
  ''I'm opposed to big government,'' Mr. Gore declared, speaking to a crowd of invited guests in a convention center meeting room. ''I'm for a smaller, smarter government, one that serves people better, but offers real change and gives more choices to our families.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Told of Mr. Gore's remarks tonight, Mr. Bush responded, ''He's the biggest spender we've ever had in the history of politics.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Following in Mr. Clinton's ideological footsteps, Mr. Gore said he was the only candidate who believed in limited government. ''I have believed in it long before it was fashionable to do so in the Democratic Party,'' he said. ''I don't believe there's a government solution to every problem. I don't believe any government program can replace the responsibility of parents, the hard work of families or the innovation of industry.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To drive home the point, Mr. Gore equated the consequences of government expansion with those of Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion income tax cut, which Mr. Gore has derided as foolhardy fiscal policy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''A return to big government,'' Mr. Gore said, ''would be as wrong for our economy as a return to big tax cuts for the wealthy.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To that end, Mr. Gore vowed: ''I will not add to the number of people doing work for the federal government, not by even one position, and there will be more who leave those ranks than the ones who are replaced.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He also said he would shrink the federal government to its smallest share of the economy in 50 years and would begin a second phase of the ''reinventing government'' initiative that he had directed for Mr. Clinton. That round of consolidations and agency reductions cut the number of federal jobs by more than 300,000, Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman, said it ''strains credibility'' for Mr. Gore to take credit for job cuts because the vast majority of those resulted from the post-cold-war retrenchment in the armed forces.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Empowering people means giving them the power to shape their own lives. Because he gives most of the tax breaks and all the power to powerful interests, Governor Bush will leave millions of families powerless and broke, left to the tender mercies of big impersonal interests and institutions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now, let's be clear about one thing. The more than $100 million raised by Governor Bush before the campaign really got into its homestretch came in significant part from a new generation of special-interest power brokers, who would like nothing better than a pliant president who would bend public policy to suit their purposes and profits, a president who would turn the decisions over to them. They know that I would fight for you, no matter what. . . .

  In the presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore has hammered at Gov. George W. Bush's problems with the uninsured in Texas. In the second debate, Mr. Bush said: ''We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the state of Texas for uninsured people. And they get health care. Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care,'' likely an allusion to the emergency rooms.

  The survey, by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, conducted in the period spanning the second and third debates, found Mr. Gore leading 44 percent to 39 percent among likely voters, down from a nine-point lead in September. Mr. Gore's support slipped away to the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, who polled at 6 percent, and to other third-party candidates. But Mr. Bush's support stayed level, showing that he still faces an uphill battle in the Golden State.

  The poll numbers were enough to prompt one Nader supporter, Greg MacArthur of the group Citizens for Strategic Voting, to drop plans to run full-page ads in California newspapers claiming that a ''vote for Nader is not a vote for Bush.'' The group wants to run the ads only in states not in play, in hopes of winning enough total votes for Mr. Nader to reach the 5 percent national threshold needed to qualify the party for matching federal campaign funds in 2004.

  ''No'' was the resounding answer Monday night from most of a dozen people at a focus group in Marlton, N.J. Even voters who were Democrats and had favorable opinions of Mr. Clinton told the focus-group pollster, Peter Hart, that the president should steer clear of the Gore campaign.

  A Gallup Poll released yesterday affirmed this view. Voters were asked if they would be more likely or less likely to vote for Mr. Gore if Mr. Clinton campaigned with him. Forty percent said ''less likely,'' while only 17 percent said ''more likely.'' Gov. George W. Bush seems to relish the idea of Mr. Clinton appearing with Mr. Gore. ''If he can't help himself and starts getting out there and campaigns against me, the shadow returns,'' Mr. Bush said.

  No hurt feelings. Mrs. Remauro, who heads the Bush campaign in New York, knows that she is promoting a candidacy without a candidate.

  Mr. Bush is trailing Vice President Al Gore by a wide margin in New York, according to the polls. Mrs. Remauro is too careful with her words to say so, but the governor has essentially given up on the state. Her job is to soften the defeat (12 points would be much nicer than 20) and worry about the scores of local races that Republicans could win.
 </textdata>

  10-25-2000

  It has been that way since July, when Mrs. Remauro, 37, gave up a job as assistant to the president at Battery Park City to become executive director of New York Victory 2000, the statewide election effort for Mr. Bush and the other Republican candidates. Since then, she has not spoken with him at all. Indeed, the only time she has ever spoken with him, and then only for a few moments, was before the March primary, while waiting to be photographed at a fund-raiser.

  They also hugged, which made a far greater impression on Mrs. Remauro than the chitchat. Mr. Bush embraced her, Mrs. Remauro said, because he saw Gov. George E. Pataki do the same and thought it would be funny.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Governor Bush said: 'Leticia! I want one of those hugs!' '' she recalled, laughing about it all over again. ''He showed me his sense of humor and his warm side right there. We had hysterical smirks on our faces when the photograph was taken.'' (It now hangs on the wall of her Republican chairwoman's office in Staten Island, which she visits in the evening after finishing work at the New York Victory 2000 headquarters on Park Avenue in Manhattan.)

  Mrs. Remauro is not slighted by Mr. Bush's apparent lack of attention to her work. Indeed, she goes out of her way not to get in his way. She has made no effort to appear on his schedule and sent others on her staff to cheer him on at the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' last week.

  The only time Mrs. Remauro ran for public office, for State Assembly in the 60th District, she took a thrashing.

Molinari's support for Senator John McCain.

  Mrs. Remauro, no matter how capable (or huggable), might not be Mr. Bush's point person in New York if New York were one of those swing states she talks about. But that does not bother her. She works as if New York is a battleground. When she was hired for the job, which pays $1,730 a week, Mr. Bush was nearly 30 points behind Mr. Gore in some polls. Mrs. Remauro could have resigned herself to a yawner.

  Without a presidential contender on hand, delivering the votes for Mr. Bush has meant worrying about a lot of little things. Her outer office in Manhattan is piled high with wooden stakes for lawn signs. The problem is that she is out of signs. She also has requests for Bush-Cheney campaign buttons, but she has run out of them as well.

  Except for a button on her bulletin board, Mrs. Remauro does not have a picture of Mr. Bush at her Park Avenue office. Instead, when she needs inspiration, she opens a toy coffin on the windowsill.

  A billboard the agency produced, which gained national publicity, depicted a photograph of George W. Bush but carried the logo for Al Gore.

  The issue has resonated on the campaign trail. Vice President Al Gore, whose campaign depends heavily on labor support, has said that any future trade deals he negotiates as president will address workers and the environment. Gov. George W.

  The Bush team has tried to make the most of Al Gore's Mike Piazza moments. It has delighted at the hopeless attempt of Mr. Gore to escape the Clinton shadow, even as the Shadow second-guesses and critiques from the sidelines, making it humiliatingly clear that the president does not think his vice president is cutting the mustard.

  Condoleezza Rice, a senior adviser to George W. Bush, has unveiled a policy that would withdraw United States troops from use in the Balkans and hold them ready for wars in other regions. According to this scheme, humanitarian involvement apparently does not conform to national interest; potentially, this is a global death sentence.

  ''How many of you own a rooftop photo-voltaic system?'' Mr. Bush then asked, ridiculing Mr. Gore's suggested tax credit for people who put solar panels on the roofs of their houses or businesses. ''If you had one, you'd get tax relief.''

  Mr. Bush was selectively homing in on some of the more obscure tax cuts that Mr. Gore has proposed, and he seemed to revel mischievously in doing so. His frisky mood also spilled over into a warning that he issued to President Clinton about getting involved in the campaign.

  In Wisconsin and Tennessee, he was campaigning in states that were expected to tilt Democratic but have not done so. But Mr. Bush has not built the kind of lead in Florida that many political analysts envisioned, and a rally in Jacksonville tonight was to be followed on Wednesday by a bus trip through the state.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  President Clinton, who defeated Mr. Bush's father, former President Bush, in 1992, also seemed to hover over the Jacksonville event. In introducing Mr. Bush, his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of the Florida, talked of the need to elect ''someone of integrity, someone of honor and decency.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And then the Texas governor said he and his brother ''were raised right.'' He added, ''We were raised by two parents who taught us to tell the truth.'' With that statement he may have been tying together and tweaking Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, and he went on to deride Mr. Gore as ''a man prone to exaggeration.''

  ''It would remind people that my opponent was not standing on his own,'' Mr. Bush said. ''There must be something amiss, if after having stiff-armed a president so to speak, all of a sudden they urge him to come back in the waning days of the campaign.''

  All day, Mr. Bush, who is grappling with Mr. Gore for undecided swing voters, invited ''open-minded Democrats'' and independents to support him, and in Arlington Heights, he cast himself as a practical centrist in  answers to questions about abortion and gun control.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000

  Although Mr. Bush opposes abortion in most cases, he said, ''This is an issue where good people can disagree and still be allies.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush's chosen focus was on taxes. He is proposing a sweeping cut of an estimated $1.3 trillion over 10 years, and it reduces the rates for taxpayers in every bracket. The largest savings, in raw dollar terms, go to the wealthiest Americans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000

  Mr. Gore is proposing a cut of $500 billion that principally applies to people in households with annual incomes under $100,000 and is largely delivered through tax credits and deductions for certain spending.
 </textdata>

  10-25-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said the proposal was too selective and intricate.
 </textdata>

  And the Democratic National Committee has organized an array of prominent liberals, including Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Gloria Steinem and Robert Redford to stump for Mr. Gore in Nader strongholds like Eugene, Ore., Madison, Wis., and Seattle.

  Not wanting to offend Mr. Nader or his supporters, those surrogates have been paying homage to his long record of fighting for a cleaner environment, consumer protection and labor rights.

  Indeed, the sudden mobilization against Mr. Nader comes after Gore campaign officials had for months dismissed him as inconsequential. But Mr. Nader has stubbornly continued to hover around 5 percent in polls taken in half a dozen tightly contested states where a shift of just a percentage point or two could determine the winner, including Oregon, Washington, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and New Mexico. A poll released today even shows Mr. Nader cutting into Mr. Gore's once-substantial lead in California.

  Now, with just two weeks left in one of the closest presidential campaigns in decades, Democrats say the last thing Mr. Gore needs is to be forced into a two-front war against both Mr. Bush and Mr. Nader.

  ''I don't want to use the argument that a vote for him is a vote for Bush -- that may be true,'' Mr. Gore told a reporter for KIRO-TV in Seattle.

 </textdata>

  But Democratic strategists say they want Mr. Gore to avoid mentioning Mr. Nader, arguing that doing so only elevates the insurgent's profile and draws attention from their real target, Mr. Bush. For that reason, the Democrats are trying to shift the burden of wooing Nader voters to a stable of well-known liberal politicians and advocates.

  Their roadshow is scheduled to visit Oregon, Wisconsin and New Mexico next week. ''Whatever value Nader brings to the public discourse,'' Ms. Birch said in an interview today, ''it pales compared to handing the federal government and Supreme Court over to George Bush.

  Mr. Nader has tried to argue that he is not likely to hurt Mr. Gore, asserting that many of his supporters are non-Democrats who probably would not vote if he dropped out of the race. Democrats dispute that. He has also said in recent weeks that he would focus his final campaigning on states where either Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore holds a substantial lead. But his tentative schedule includes stops in closely contested states like Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan.

  The Democrats have asked Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, to campaign for Mr. Gore in the Pacific Northwest.

  Because Mr. Nader could also win  votes from union members who are angry with Mr. Gore for supporting global trade, the Democrats have organized a list of heavyweight labor leaders to help. Earlier this week, John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., toured the Northwest with other labor officials urging labor activists to stick with Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000

 <textdata>
  Andrew L. Stern, head of the service employees union, said in an interview that he had been telling crowds in the Northwest: ''If you can wake up the next morning and live with George Bush as the next president, then I guess you can vote for Nader. This is not a low-risk protest vote.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Democratic Party has also been asking Gore supporters to flood the Nader campaign with e-mail messages urging him to drop out of the race. It has also been promoting a Web site created by a group of former colleagues of Mr. Nader's called nadersraidersforgore.com.
 </textdata>

  No law requires officials or candidates to make their tax returns public, but Mr. Bush has provided The New York Times with copies of his complete returns since 1994.

  No, George W. Bush hasn't blamed Mr. Gore for American mortality. But he's done something comparable. Mr. Gore has been pointing out, correctly, that Mr. Bush has promised $1 trillion in Social Security taxes to two different groups of people -- telling young workers that he will allow them to invest the money in personal accounts, while assuring older workers that it will be available to pay for their retirement. So Mr. Bush has responded by charging that Mr. Gore's Social Security plan will add no less than $40 trillion to the national debt.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Meanwhile, Mr. Bush has said nothing about reducing benefits. So his plan for Social Security would cost just as much as his opponent's -- or rather considerably more, because to honor those contradictory promises he has to find another pot of money somewhere.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  10-25-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Maybe blaming Mr. Gore for future mortality wouldn't have worked; but Mr. Bush's advisers seem to think that blaming him for the entire future liabilities of the Social Security system will, or at least can serve temporarily to confuse voters who might otherwise have started to think too clearly about the subject. Only two weeks to go until the election, and we can clean up the mess later, right?
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush's plans -- and, to a lesser extent, Mr. Gore's plans -- are based on projections that assume there will be no increase in federal discretionary spending over the next 10 years. But over the last few months, while you weren't looking, Congress went on a bipartisan spending spree -- with a cost estimated by both Democratic and Republican analysts at more than $800 billion over the next decade.

  How will the next president deal with this bad news? Mr. Gore has a bit of slack in his budget, and has proclaimed that protecting the surplus is his highest priority; maybe he would decide to jettison his unloved and unlovely targeted tax cuts. But Mr. Bush's budget even now adds up thanks only to creative accounting, and he has made it clear that he cannot conceive of anything that would make him renege on his tax-cutting promises. (Did someone say ''Read my lips''?)

  As platform director, Mr. Cherny joins the ranks of other platform writers with silky prose and grand ideas who later became leading policy makers within the party. In 1984, it was Susan Estrich, who managed the 1988 Dukakis campaign. In 1992, it was Bruce Reed, now a top domestic policy adviser to Mr. Clinton. And in 1996, it was Mr. Reed and Elaine Kamarck, who is now policy director for the Gore campaign.

  And what if there is a Gore administration? Mr. Cherny says he wants to return to California, finish law school and become a criminal prosecutor.

  Once again this week, it seemed that Al Gore could not catch a break: One national poll even had him 13 points behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Mr. Gore found himself again confronted by questions over whether the Justice Department would investigate his fund-raising practices. And Ralph Nader was elected the nominee of the Green Party, leaving Democrats to fret that he would steal votes from Mr. Gore's base. All this occurred within days after Mr. Gore named a new campaign chairman.
 </textdata>

  But even Bush loyalists concede that Democrats should not despair -- at least not yet.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  No one should underestimate Mr. Gore's potential political potency: Voters may, in the end, give him credit for helping preside over the longest economic expansion in the nation's history. He is a disciplined, if lackluster, campaigner who is known for performing best in adversity. He displayed that ability when he toppled former Senator Bill Bradley in the primaries. Now, he plans to zero in on Mr. Bush's support of a rather unpopular but enormous tax cut, as well as the governor's stands on Social Security and Medicare.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another advantage for Mr. Gore is that no one questions his competence to make decisions and to grasp issues -- and to understand how to navigate the often befuddling world of government and politics in Washington. If voters find they are not sufficiently confident of Mr. Bush's preparedness for the Oval Office -- or his heft on the issues -- they could turn to Mr. Gore by default.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-3-2000

 <textdata>
  There is truth to the spin from the Gore camp that the public has yet to focus on the presidential race. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in mid-June, only 13 percent of expected voters said they were following the race very closely.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-3-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The reality is that many voters may be waiting for the conventions or the fall debates to learn more about the contenders and settle on a choice. That could be a plus for Mr. Gore, who has far more extensive experience as a debater and is steeped much more deeply in national and international issues. (One danger is that the high expectations for Mr. Gore in debates could work against him if Mr. Bush performs unexpectedly -- and reassuringly -- well.)

  One of Mr. Gore's biggest problems is, simply, that voters seem to like Mr. Bush more and think the vice president is too politically calculating and relentlessly ambitious. But Gore aides said they hoped to turn that into a virtue by convincing voters that as president he would channel that determination and energy into his policy agenda.

  Another often neglected reality is that the race may be closer than it now looks. Despite Mr. Gore's troubles in winning over loyal Democrats, in the end the likelihood is that most Democrats will side with him and most Republicans will side with Mr. Bush, leaving the contest to turn on a relatively narrow swath of swing and independent voters.

  Rather than dwell on current polls, Democrats can take heart that in three of the last five presidential elections, the candidate behind in the polls at this point won in November: Ronald Reagan in 1980, George Bush in 1988 and Bill Clinton in 1992.

  It could be, of course, that Mr. Gore will never climb out of his rut in the polls and that the electorate has settled early on Mr. Bush. As one top Gore aide put it, voters ''might decide that they like the other guy better and that's that.''

  ''He's a sitting vice president with an economy that seems like it's doing pretty well,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He's going to be very difficult to beat. I am not the favorite. Nor is he. I think it's going to be a very close race. I do.''

  ''The polls that show Bush ahead are extremely soft and misleading,'' said Mike Murphy, who was a top strategist for the primary campaign of Senator John McCain. Referring to Medicare and Social Security, he said, ''Gore has a muddy bag full of ugly wedge issues and he knows how to use them. It's very possible that this race will snap back to near even after the conventions.''

  For all their public confidence, some Gore advisers privately worry that Mr. Gore should be far ahead in the polls right now -- not lagging -- given the robust economy and the fact that all seems well in the world. They are concerned that as Mr. Bush reaches out to moderates, Mr. Gore is still having trouble winning over reliable Democratic voters.

  At their weekly meeting, top campaign strategists in Nashville last week mulled over what could be going wrong. Everyone seemed to have a suggestion: Some aides concluded that Mr. Gore was coming off as too liberal and needed to be even more aggressively reaching out to moderates. But, participants said, there was also a discussion of what some strategists think is Mr. Gore's fundamental problem: that people do not seem to like him as much as they like Mr. Bush.

  ''This is a very winnable race for him,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster. ''Bush still hasn't proven that he can take the heat. And Gore seems to shine the most when the pressure is on.''

  ''On the big policy issues, I think Gore wins,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''By the time the debates are over, Bush is not going to be able to dominate on any of these issues. The obvious issue is: 'Didn't these people produce the biggest and best economy in modern history?' And Gore has an edge on the gravitas issue. It will be: 'Who is intelligent enough and who is competent enough to keep us going the way we've been going?' ''
 </textdata>

  But some Republicans simply refuse to buy the possibility of a Gore triumph. ''There's very little that worries me about him,'' said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, who is working closely with the Bush campaign. ''He's going to put together a scorched-earth operation. And he's going to slash and burn.''

  And Governor Bush, in a slip of the tongue, apparently was so confident at an event earlier this month that he dispensed with the formalities -- like the actual election. ''As president,'' he declared, ''I'm here in Knoxville, Tennessee, to tell America I'll set a new tone in Washington.''

  ''It is hard for me to figure out why administration officials, from President Clinton and Vice President Gore on down, keep insisting that they are interested in ousting Saddam and yet not one official of this administration has been willing to take even the most minimal steps towards that end,'' Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican from Kansas, said at a Senate subcommittee hearing on Wednesday that was attended by several opposition leaders.

  Gov. George Ryan says he never expected the national attention he has received for declaring a moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois. Mr. Ryan found himself in the media spotlight recently  as a counterexample to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who was presiding over his 135th execution in five years. Mr. Ryan is by no one's description a maverick. A pharmacist by training, he has spent nearly 30 years in state politics, first as a member of the Illinois Legislature, then as the Republican leader and speaker of the House, then for two terms as lieutenant governor and two terms as secretary of state, until he won election as governor in 1998.

  That high standard calls into question the record of other death penalty states. For death penalty supporters like Governor Bush and Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Ryan's cautious approach is a rebuke to their own blindness to the system's mistakes. He has instructed the nation on the only morally coherent position for supporters of capital punishment to take, and that is that no execution can go forward when there is abundant evidence that innocent people have been put on death row.

  Miles to Go in Campaign, Amid Gloom and Confidence  It is no secret that even with 130 days to go before the election, Democrats are unsettled, even gloomy, while Republicans are confident. Could the presidential race be over barely after it started? One national poll had Vice President Al Gore 13 points behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But even Bush loyalists concede that Democrats should not despair -- at least not yet.

  Soon we will bid farewell to Bill Clinton, our companion through so many civic adventures, from the New Covenant to the V-chip. We can be confident that his successor will be a man who listens to the lessons of the past. In fact, both Al Gore and George W.

  We all realize that Mr. Bush is the son of one former president. But how many of you know that he is also a direct descendant of another? Yes, some of Mr. Bush's genomes were once worn by Franklin Pierce -- the man known as ''Young Hickory'' to his supporters in New Hampshire and ''The Fainting General'' to his troops in the field. He was also called ''the victor over many a hard-fought bottle,'' but only by political opponents wishing to harp on isolated incidents, all of which I believe occurred before his 40th birthday.

  Our candidates are both the products of great traditions of public service. Mr. Gore is the son of a senator, Mr. Bush is the grandson.

  Some people go further and claim that there are not even any issues worth fighting for in this flaccid new era. They miss the days when the mere mention of ''free silver'' or ''Remember the Maine'' or ''Save Checkers'' set passions quivering. Today, our blood runs cooler. Still, who among us did not feel a twinge of excitement as we watched the Al Gore Prosperity and Progress Tour? Who did not feel relief at the news that George W. Bush intends to be a Reformer With Results?

  HOW TO BURN $73 MILLION  With George W. Bush breaking all fund-raising records, a lot of people in the political consulting and media business are reaping a windfall. A new report by the Center for Responsive Politics shows exactly how Mr. Bush spent the $73 million raised for his primary bid. The big-ticket item was $21.7 million in campaign advertising, mostly for television. Air charters came in second at $4.7 million, and other forms of travel expenses -- buses, cars, parking and hotels -- added an additional $1.4 million. Then came direct-mail expenses at $4.2 million, with $4.1 million on postage, printing and delivery of those direct-mail pieces, plus $2.9 million for payroll, $135,741 for consultants and -- of course -- $672,210 for fund-raising. ''Bush's spending seems more fitting for a small corporation than a campaign for president,'' said Holly Bailey, who wrote the study. Put another way, since Mr. Bush announced his presidential candidacy in March 1999, he has rolled up a money ''burn rate'' of $1.3 million a week, or $180,000 a day.

  LONG RUNNING MATE LIST  Gov. George W. Bush met with the head of his vicepresidential search team yesterday and said he still had a long and varied list of potential running mates to consider. At his ranch north of Waco, Tex., the Texas governor met with former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and said he had not even decided whether to announce his choice before or at the Republican National Convention, which begins in four weeks in Philadelphia. Mr. Bush again said that he was not ruling out supporters of abortion rights and that women were being considered. ''The main test will be, Can the person be president and will the person be loyal to this administration and will the person bring added value to the Bush administration,'' he said.

  BIG LEAD MISLEADING?  Although most national polls have shown Gov. George W. Bush with a healthy lead over Vice President Al Gore, a new survey by Newsweek magazine has found them in a dead heat. In a two-way race, Mr. Gore has the support of 46 percent of voters, with Mr. Bush at 45 percent, the survey found. A four-way race also produced a deadlock with Mr. Bush at 41 percent, Mr. Gore at 40 percent, Ralph Nader at 6 percent and Patrick J. Buchanan at 2 percent. The survey polled 752 people in late June and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

  Mr. Bush's advisers say the technology-based economy and the growth of a middle-income investor class will make voters far more responsive to Republican ideas for decentralizing government and reshaping the New Deal and Great Society programs for the elderly.

 <textdata>
  Some talk of the new economy is as much about symbolism as about substance. It allows Mr. Gore to try to capitalize on what should be his greatest strength, the extraordinary economic expansion of the Clinton years. And for Mr. Bush, analysts say, presenting himself as a managerial reformer lets him look less ideological than other Republicans, particularly those in Congress.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush agree on some broad themes. They both embrace free trade in the increasingly global economy, in contrast to the third-party contenders, Patrick J. Buchanan and Ralph Nader, and many Congressional Democrats.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  For example, Mr. Gore would expand three government entitlement programs, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. He would bring more of the uninsured under the auspices of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. He would create a new Medicare prescription-drug benefit for the elderly. And he would offer more Social Security benefits to women.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush argues for more individual choice. So he would allow workers to divert an unspecified part of their Social Security payroll tax to private investment accounts. He would turn Medicare from a fee-for-service guaranteed benefit program to one that lets people buy different levels of health insurance.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A similar contrast concerns education. Both men would invest in schools and teachers -- Mr. Gore putting in about 10 times more money than Mr. Bush -- and both have plans for how to improve accountability and performance. But two proposals are particularly telling.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore would extend the reach of public-school systems by giving states grants to create public pre-schools. Mr. Bush, as a lever against failing schools, would give low-income parents whose children attend such schools vouchers that could pay for private-school tuition.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush calls for a $1.3-trillion across-the-board tax cut over a decade, saying, ''A government with unlimited funds soon becomes a government of unlimited reach.'' Mr. Gore offers $500 billion in tax cuts intended to reimburse people for particular needs -- like child care or college tuition -- and phasing out as income rises.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides call the top-down, big-government structures outmoded relics of the Great Depression. ''Governor Bush will put more control over decisions -- whether they are health, retirement or savings -- in the hands of individuals,'' Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said. ''The vice president will maintain them in the hands of government.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Democrats respond that Mr. Bush's ideas would erode the common commitment to many government institutions.

 <textdata>
  ''The big danger with a lot of the Bush programs is what we call cherry-picking,'' said Robert Reich, the former labor secretary. ''The healthy, the wealthy or the well-educated will be the first to opt out, leaving the poor, the sicker and the lesser-educated behind in the general insurance pools or in the education system. This is a sure-fire recipe for social stratification.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush promotes his tax cut by saying it would remove six million low-income families from the tax rolls. Critics say it would also give most of its benefits to higher-income groups simply because those pay the most taxes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal public policy group, found that Mr. Bush's plan would give the top 1 percent of tax payers 42 percent of the tax cuts, while the bottom 20 percent of tax payers would get less than 1 percent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides counter that their approach to tax cuts gives individuals more choice on how to use their money. ''Gore views government's roles as manipulating people and uses people's own tax money to manipulate their behavior,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser. ''Bush says it's your money. You keep it. Do what you think is best with it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A similar debate is brewing over Social Security. Depending on how it is structured, Mr. Bush's plan to switch some Social Security payroll tax to individual savings accounts could prove more lucrative for upper-income groups.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some plans on Capitol Hill try to address this by cutting the basic Social Security benefit more for higher-income individuals than lower-income ones or by giving extra contributions to low-income workers. Mr. Bush has said the idea of matching funds for the lower incomes should be considered. But he has not committed to it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore would preserve the current Social Security system, and create a new retirement plan in addition to it. This plan would be similar to a 401 (k) plan and geared toward helping lower-income groups.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides also say Mr. Gore would make Medicare and Social Security more expansive and costly at a time when the boomer generation's impending retirement threatens to bankrupt the systems.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The fundamental challenge facing the next president is to solve this problem,'' Mr. Lindsey said. ''What Gore just proposed is layering another new unfunded entitlement on top of what's already out there.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-4-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides also prefer to steer the debate to how people are helped. They say they want to give people with lower incomes the same kinds of choices the wealthy have -- whether it is the choice of attending a private school or the choice of investing their retirement money in the stock market.

  The demographic shift has begun to change the state's politics as scores of Hispanic voters have registered as Democrats in a backlash spurred by Republican-led campaigns against illegal immigration.

  Gore Links Drug Makers And G.O.P. to High Costs  Vice President Al Gore accused drug makers of ''price-gouging'' and ''special interest schemes'' to keep prices high, as he began a weeklong drive on an issue that has emerged as one of the most potent this election season -- the rising cost of prescription drugs.

  Mr. Gore has a history of taking on the drug companies, dating to his years in Congress, although some of his friends and advisers now represent the pharmaceutical industry as lobbyists.

  Mr. Gore singled out for criticism the manufacturer of Claritan D, a top-selling allergy medication, because it is circulating legislation to extend its patent. He said drug patents were not designed to create a situation ''where we can be just exploited forever by the wealthy and the powerful.''

  The vice president's plan and that of the House Republicans would both contain subsides for low-income seniors and protections for those with high drug costs. The Republicans would provide 100 percent drug-cost coverage after an individual's out-of-pocket costs reached $6,000. Mr. Gore would pay for all expenses after out-of-pocket costs reached $4,000.

  The drug industry is the second industry that Mr. Gore has gone after in recent weeks, having just finished a series of broadsides against the oil companies. Today, he hailed news that Saudi Arabia was raising oil production and called on the ''big oil companies'' to pass along price reductions.

  Major problems, like concentration of corporate power, corporate crime and corporate welfare, health care, continued degradation of inner cities and child poverty, linger on election after election without solution, regardless of which party captures the White House. Facile rhetoric becomes a substitute for leadership. The Clinton-Gore record offers no real hope for changing the concentration of power by the few over the needs of the many.

  For Mr. Gore the backing is an important symbol of support from the Democratic Party's traditional base and a significant organizing tool for the coming months. But while the vice president will try to use the endorsements to show that his education agenda reflects the opinions of classroom experts, his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, will undoubtedly accuse Mr. Gore of being in the unions' pockets and uninterested in true school reform.

  Mr. Gore wants to provide preschool for every 4-year-old, give teachers signing bonuses to work in difficult schools and pump federal money into school construction, among other ideas totaling $115 billion over a decade. Mr. Bush would spend $13 billion and focus attention on holding low-performing schools accountable by imposing financial penalties and heightening scrutiny of test data, particularly among minority students.

  Among the chasms between the candidates are their positions on providing vouchers, financed by taxpayers, for tuition in private schools, an issue that alone might have been enough to decide the union endorsements. Mr. Bush refrains from using the word ''vouchers,'' but would let students at failing schools take $1,500 of government money to a private school. Mr. Gore opposes vouchers, as do the unions.

  Another goal of executive actions these days, of course, is to aid Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid. It was Mr. Clinton who signed the order earlier this year granting increased protection to 250,000 acres of federal land in Oregon and Washington State.

  But later in the April 18 interview, Mr. Gore said he did not know whether the now-infamous luncheon that he attended at a Buddhist temple in California was a fund-raising event. He disputed the suggestion that White House coffees were used as fund-raising events by the Democratic Party -- although millions of dollars flowed from the people who attended them. And the vice president said he thought he had attended only one White House coffee when documents showed that he had attended 23.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Law enforcement officials said that Mr. Gore was so meticulous in his recall of some matters (at one point describing himself as a ''stickler to a fault'' who sometimes corrected the grammar of his campaign letters) that they doubted his vague responses to questions about his campaign finance activities.

 <textdata>
  What follows is a status report on the significant matters in the Gore inquiry.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  THE ISSUE -- On April 29, 1996, Mr. Gore attended a luncheon organized by John Huang and Maria Hsia, both of whom were Democratic fund-raisers, at the Hsi Lai Temple, a Buddhist monastery near Los Angeles in Hacienda Heights, Calif. The luncheon with about 100 community leaders was one of the first campaign finance controversies to embroil the vice president, who was invited to the temple by a leader of the group, which is based in Taiwan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The event raised the issue of whether the temple had held a political fund-raiser in violation of its tax-exempt status as a religious institution and whether temple monastics were illegally reimbursed for contributions. There was also the question of whether Mr. Gore knew it was a fund-raiser.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Initially, Mr. Gore said in an October 1996 interview with National Public Radio that the luncheon was a ''community outreach'' event. But in January 1997, a spokesman for the vice president said Mr. Gore ''knew it was a finance-related event.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  THE INVESTIGATION -- Investigators found that Mr. Gore routinely attended fund-raisers and community outreach events organized by the Democratic National Committee. Some documents suggested confusion among Mr. Gore's staff because the vice president initially planned to attend two events in a single day in Los Angeles, one a fund-raising luncheon and the other a visit to the temple. The two stops were melded into one because of time constraints.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Reno decided against appointing an independent counsel to review  Mr. Gore's fund-raising, although he was not questioned about the temple event until last April. Justice Department prosecutors brought criminal charges against two fund-raisers involved in the temple luncheon. Mr. Huang pleaded guilty for his role in soliciting about $159,000 in donations from people who attended the event and from temple monastics. In an appearance before a House committee, Mr. Huang testified that he had no evidence implicating Mr. Gore in any wrongdoing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  THE VICE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS -- In one of the most caustic exchanges of his April interview with prosecutors, Mr. Gore angrily denied that he had been told by aides that the temple event was a fund-raiser.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I sure as hell don't recall having -- I sure as hell did not have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising event,'' Mr. Gore testified.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Conrad, who was appointed by Ms. Reno in late December, decided to ask Mr. Gore questions about the coffees. Mr. Gore disputed Mr. Conrad's suggestion that White House coffees were used as ''fund-raising tools'' by the Democratic Party.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore replied, ''That is absolutely my impression.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Conrad asked if it was true that Mr. Gore had served as host of 23 White House coffees and sat in with President Clinton at 8 others. ''Would that be an accurate statement?'' Mr. Conrad asked.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Later, Mr. Gore said he could not recall attending any coffees. ''This was on the president's side of things,'' he said. ''That's my memory and impression.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said it ''was not my practice to go to any of these coffees.'' He added, ''There may have been one that I attended briefly, perhaps because some of the invitees were known to me and wanted to say hello.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Two days after the interview, Mr. Gore's lawyer, James F. Neal, acknowledged in a letter to Mr. Conrad that Mr. Gore misunderstood the question, and thought it dealt only with ''White House coffees.'' Mr. Neal wrote that according to the vice president's schedule, Mr. Gore had attended 4 White House coffees and he had acted as host of 21 coffees in the Old Executive Office Building.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  THE ISSUE -- From December 1995 to April 1996, Mr. Gore made 45 fund-raising telephone calls from his West Wing office in the White House. The calls raised the issue of whether Mr. Gore may have violated the Pendleton Act, an 1883 civil service law, which bars elected officials from using federal property to raise campaign contributions. The law was designed to prevent officeholders from pressuring their subordinates into making political donations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore made his calls from his White House office. Mr. Clinton made similar calls from his White House quarters, which is not considered official government property.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Among those Mr. Gore called was Robert Johnson, chairman of Black Entertainment Television Holdings. In one document disclosed by a House committee, a call sheet prepared by the Democratic Party, Mr. Gore was told to ask Mr. Johnson ''to write $30K for the media campaign.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  THE INVESTIGATION -- In 1997, Ms. Reno absolved Mr. Gore of any wrongdoing in connection with the phone calls. She found that Mr. Gore's calls were intended to raise money only for general party purposes, a category known as soft money. She concluded that Mr. Gore did not realize that part of the money was funneled into hard-money accounts that were used for Clinton-Gore re-election activities but were restricted by federal election laws.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In 1998, Ms. Reno's findings were challenged when investigators obtained a Nov. 21, 1995, memorandum written by David M. Strauss, then Mr. Gore's deputy chief of staff. On the memorandum were Mr. Strauss's handwritten notes that suggested Mr. Gore might have known that some of the money raised by his calls was allocated to direct re-election activities.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a series of interviews with prosecutors, four participants in the meeting, including Leon A. Panetta, the former White House chief of staff, recalled that Mr. Gore was present for a discussion of how the money was to be allocated. But seven or eight others told investigators  they could not recall a discussion about money raised by phone calls going to the restricted hard money accounts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  MR. GORE'S COMMENTS -- When interviewed by prosecutors on Nov. 11, 1998, Mr. Gore said he was sometimes inattentive and missed parts of the fund-raising meetings. According to F.B.I. notes on the interview, Mr. Gore said he ''drank a lot of iced tea during meetings, which could have necessitated a restroom break.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-5-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS -- In December 1998, Ms. Reno cleared Mr. Gore of wrongdoing. In reaching her decision, she rebuffed recommendations from six senior aides and relied instead on the advice of a single trusted adviser, Lee J. Radek, the chief of the Justice Department's public corruption unit.

  The legislation restricting secret fund-raising was a significant step forward, but its impact should not be exaggerated. Some of the shadowy tax-exempt groups affected by the bill are now expected to transform themselves into for-profit shell corporations and continue their practices. Other nonprofit groups may also run ads. It is still legal for groups without tax exemptions to raise money and run sham campaign ads like the ones attacking Senator John McCain that were organized by donors to Gov. George W. Bush last March.

  A white with a different personality might have fared better. There was one other white on the 70-man squad, Matt Bushart. And though as a punter he was at the periphery of the team and little noticed by fans, Mr. Bushart had the personality and experience to cope better as a minority. While Marcus had seemed protected and naive even to the middle-class white students at Catholic High, Matt's years at a local public high school where most of his football teammates were black had taught him how to live comfortably among them. While Marcus was more introspective, a loner, a little too sensitive for some of his coaches' tastes, Matt was noisy, funny, sometimes crude -- so outgoing, his girlfriend said, that he could talk to a wall.

  When Mr. Bushart's teammates made fun of the country music he liked, he gave it right back to them about their rap, and kept listening to his music. ''I get kidded about it,'' he said, ''but there's been a song that's been playing and one of the black guys will come by and say, 'Play that again, that's actually not too bad.' ''

Ryan Lewis, his old roommate, was there, and so was Matt Bushart, the white punter.

It gets an extra dose of attention every four years during the New Hampshire primary campaign. Vice President Al Gore used it last winter for a stump speech.

  The spoken voice was more valuable to him than the written citation. Example: In 1991, as President Bush was about to decide to end pursuit of Saddam Hussein's forces in Iraq, Gen. Colin Powell was asked to call Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf to see if he agreed. An eyewitness, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, reported that Powell used the hotline to Riyadh and told the president, ''Norm says he can handle it.'' Question to the dialect lexicographer: What does I can handle it mean?

  Yet the labels conservative and liberal do not fully capture this court. ''Which cases were most visible to the public this year?'' John G. Roberts Jr., a Supreme Court practitioner and and former deputy solicitor general during the Bush administration, asked rhetorically the other day. ''Probably school prayer, abortion, and Miranda, and the conservatives lost all three,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''The conventional wisdom needs to be taken skeptically.''

  With the slightly unnatural aura of hand-colored photographs, these landscapes have a dream-like quality that straddles the border between real and surreal. In fact, they are mostly montages created in the machine, using interactive textures and tones. ''Transition'' superimposes a pair of desolate bushes on a wood-grain texture that approximates a windswept sky, but not so perfectly that one doesn't pause to question what it really is. Nor is color left in its natural state. In ''Blazing Bush,'' for example, certain areas are intensified, as if a selective light had been trained on them, while others are played down. The overall effect is haunting and subtle, and it works much better without glass between image and viewer. Look at the unframed prints in portfolios to get a fuller appreciation of their tonal richness and delicate detail.

  For more than a decade, politicians and civic leaders have been looking to volunteers like me to take over the government's role in providing vital services to the poor. Although the movement arguably began in 1988 with the candidate George Bush's invocation of ''a thousand points of light'' as a response to Reagan-era cutbacks in social spending, it has been embraced by the current Democratic administration, which has continued those cutbacks, and culminated in the 1997 President's Summit for America's Future in Philadelphia, where President Clinton and Gen. Colin Powell touted the power of volunteerism. Now George W. Bush has picked up his father's theme of ''a kinder, gentler'' America by pushing ''charitable choice'' -- the provision in the 1996 welfare reform bill that allows faith-based organizations to contract with government to provide social services to the poor. (Al Gore supports it, too, though less vigorously.)

  The Americans With Disabilities Act, the federal civil rights law dealing with hotels and motels, trains and buses, airports and public arenas, does not cover taxicabs. But at least 14 cities in the United States and 7 in Canada have accessible cabs in operation, according to research by the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association. These cities include Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, Boston and Las Vegas. A number of them enacted rules requiring these vehicles, almost all since the A.D.A. was signed by President George Bush in 1990.

  The surprise is how such rich cookies can be so boring. The sweetness of the Bush cookies overwhelms any other flavor except an occasional bite of chocolate. Mrs. Gore's ginger snap cookies look boring, but they are marginally better. They need more ginger, though.

  Bland cookies seem appropriate for the current presidential campaign. And it seems fitting, too, that the magazine's recipe for the Bush cookies turns out tough cookies. The recipe Mrs. Bush's office submitted suggested that her cookies be baked for 10 to 12 minutes. Family Circle changed it to 17 to 20. A friend who baked the cookies following the magazine's directions turned out unattractive jawbreakers; the cookies should have soft centers. At 17 minutes in my oven the cowboy cookies were also overdone.

 <textdata>
  Even worse, anyone who followed the Bush recipe as it first appeared on the magazine's Web site may have found their cookies turn to ashes, possibly a small fire. The site's suggested baking time of 17 to 29 minutes has since been corrected.

  Gov. George W. Bush was all set and ready to go from New York City to Detroit on Tuesday when his campaign plane let out an enormous belch, drawing the attention of maintenance workers and stranding him and his entourage on the tarmac at La Guardia Airport. He seemed amused and unalarmed. ''This is an optimistic campaign,'' the Texas governor joked to the reporters who were sitting several rows behind but plenty close enough to see and hear him.

  Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, was in Philadelphia, and had just finished a speech on energy and the environment that was chock-a-block with ideas, aspirations, painstakingly emphasized phrases and showy digressions, including a survey of transportation in the 20th century that began with horses, buggies and the environmental hazards they posed. ''Feed lots were crowding out farmland,'' Mr. Gore noted. He then headed to a convention hall to address union workers, effortlessly switching his focus from pollution to occupational safety and quickly establishing that he knew a lot about that, too. If he ever truly relaxed, it was not evident. Then again, the reporters on his plane, Air Force Two, had no glimpse of his cabin up front, and Mr. Gore never did drop by to say hello.

  Mr. Bush's looseness and confidence may have something to do with his edge over Mr. Gore in most polls, but they also threaten to strain the appeal of levity to voters who undoubtedly want to look up to their president. Mr. Gore's diligence may have something to do with his need to catch up, but it also threatens to strain the appeal of gravity to voters who undoubtedly don't want their president to lecture them all the time.

  The candidates' days on the campaign trail this week also revealed another potentially crucial difference. Mr. Bush, guarding an apparent lead, let himself focus more intensely on fund-raising than on talking points, and collected about $9.5 million for the Republican National Committee. Mr. Gore was more absorbed in making the argument for his candidacy, and collected only about $1.5 million for the Democrats.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-2-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Unlike Mr. Gore's fund-raisers, Mr. Bush's were closed to reporters, a strategic decision by Republicans, who said they worried that any discussion of the Texas governor and money served to reinforce their reputation as the party of the rich and to remind voters that Mr. Bush's candidacy has been fueled by an unprecedented sum of contributions.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush's aides even played down the tallies: the original estimate of money raised at a Tuesday breakfast of 55 people was $3 million, but the ultimate sum was $4 million. On Thursday, Mr. Bush did not have a single public campaign event, but he held a fund-raiser for the party in Dallas that brought in an estimated $4.5 million.

  Yet in the same week, he spent an evening in New York with members of the Congress for Racial Equality, once a leading civil-rights organization, now a collection of black conservatives. On the dais with Mr. Bush were people thought to be descendants of Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings, as well as Barry Slotnick, the lawyer for Bernhard H. Goetz, the subway shooter.

  Mr. Bush seemed most comfortable not in front of audiences but one-on-one on his campaign plane, where he sets a tone of easy affability. There is an openness that is not possible on the more formal and restricted Air Force Two. On Monday, as reporters filed on board, the governor was standing in the press section scarfing down pizza and ready for chit-chat and hands-on schmoozing. He placed both paws on one reporter's shoulders, then pinched another on the cheek.

  Unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore did not banter all that much, but he did talk and talk. He talked about the environment in front of a modernized power plant in Philadelphia and about ''community empowerment'' in a meeting hall in Columbus, Ohio. He talked about the scourge of AIDS and ''Afro-pessimism,'' or the wrong-headed belief that investment in Africa was a losing game.

  ''Each station celebrates the unique quality of life in Oregon,'' Mr. Gore said. ''One of them has a scarecrow weather vane, bronze rails and other things that are uniquely representative of the rural heritage in that area. Another one, they had a contest where the families participated in making the tiles themselves, and each family had a separate tile and they all come together to make up the stop. And some of them put their baby's footprints in the tile.''

  This went on for well over a minute, before Mr. Gore finally said, ''Now, Chicago, of course, is another great national model for mass transit.'' He had returned at last to the present place and time, but it was unclear how many people in the audience were still with him.

  Mr. Gore is not alone in having questions raised about his candor under oath, questions that had House Republicans putting pressure on Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a special counsel. The independent counsel Robert W. Ray recently concluded that the testimony of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the dismissal of several White House travel office employees in 1993 was at least truthful enough that Mr. Ray did not think he could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she had lied.

  Mr. Gore was, in fact, tolerably forthcoming as far as depositions go. At times, he was precise, even a little funny. He knew that on the day of the interview he had been vice president for ''seven years and two months and 28 days.'' He recounted his delight on learning in the spring of 1996 that his schedule would include a luncheon at a Buddhist temple in California. ''This ought to be interesting,'' he said he remembered thinking. ''Little did I know.''

  None of this is to suggest that life outside of litigation is an Eden of truth-telling. Mr. Gore was questioned mercilessly about a seemingly harmless courtesy letter to a supporter after a visit to Taiwan. He was made to assess his own truthfulness, sentence by sentence. ''No, I was actually glad I was not with them on the rest of the voyage,'' he testified. And, he continued, ''the statement that the 'meetings with the government and business leaders were fascinating' appears to be an overstatement, as does the description of the visit to the Fo Kuang Shan facility as being 'almost overwhelming.' '' So too ''the statement that it was 'the most enjoyable trip I have ever taken.' '' The entire thing was a tissue of lies or, as Mr. Gore put it, ''within the customary bounds of this sort of communication.''

  Mr. Bernson was responding to a warning by the Los Angeles police of the potential for ''a level of activity'' at least as intense as the violent protest that disrupted a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle last December. Responding to those concerns, the council approved a plan to cordon off protesters in a fenced-in parking lot, and the Secret Service revised plans for lodging Vice President Al Gore in a nearby hotel. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit against the restrictions.

  The jittery mood was a counterpoint to the placidity of the campaign elsewhere. As has become almost pro forma in the campaign, another multi-billion-dollar spending plan was put forth by a presumptive nominee: Mr. Gore unveiled an energy plan that he said would authorize $148 billion over 10 years to improve mass transportation and decrease dependence on oil.
 </textdata>

  ''I have never been afraid to take on big oil,'' Mr. Gore said, an obvious dig at his rival, Gov. George W. Bush, a former oilman. Mr. Bush, however, said Mr. Gore was fooling no one, as a member of an administration that has seen a 50-cent rise in the cost of gasoline in recent months.

  If Mr. Nader's words threatened to liven the race up a bit, so did the ruling on Tuesday by the United States Supreme Court, striking down a Nebraska law that banned a procedure known as a partial-birth abortion. Mr. Gore used the decision to remind voters of Mr. Bush's opposition to abortion rights. ''His views about choice are really quite extreme,'' the vice president said.

  Documents in the court records show that when President George Bush lowered payroll withholding rates in 1992, Block contacted its refund loan customers to show them how to increase their withholding back to the old levels.

  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has already declared his opposition to any breaching of the dams. By contrast, Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, has refused to comment directly on the issue.
 </textdata>

  The Gore campaign can hardly contain its glee over the daily headlines out of Texas describing a budget shortfall and its attendant problems. The Gore campaign can be expected to hit the air with television commercials on the subject soon, and will milk the budget problems for maximum publicity for some time to come, particularly as a competing story line about the Bush campaign in the days leading up to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
 </textdata>

  ''We believe that how the governor runs Texas says important things about how he'd run the country,'' said Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Fabiani added that the Gore team perceives the Texas budget shortfall as politically devastating for Mr. Bush as the pollution of Boston Harbor was to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts when he ran for president in 1988.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore told reporters tonight that the Boston Harbor comparison ''never crossed my mind.'' But when asked whether he hoped his attacks on Mr. Bush would be as effective as the attacks on Mr. Dukakis, he did not answer directly. Instead, he criticized the administration of Mr. Bush's father, which he said ''squandered'' money on a tax cut that could have been used on a cleanup.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There is a special irony for the Gore campaign in being able to turn the Boston Harbor strategy so forcefully against Governor Bush since his father, in seeking the presidency in 1988, had turned Boston Harbor into a weapon against Mr. Dukakis.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign has already been using bits of this strategy by pointing to a variety of problems in Texas, but the vice president's advisers said the budget offered a graphic opportunity to bring various threads of the Texas story together. These threads, as Mr. Gore described them today, run from Mr. Bush's ''unaffordable tax cuts for powerful interests, coupled with vague promises that the numbers will somehow add up in the future.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One Gore aide exclaimed, ''It's a metaphor for everything!''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The controversy became public last week when state budget officials confirmed that unanticipated cost overruns, particularly in Medicaid and in state prisons, had thrown the state $610 million over budget. Mr. Bush's aides quickly responded that cost overruns were routine during any two-year budget cycle, and that the surplus would more than make up the difference.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But several Texas Democrats are pouncing on the issue, blaming the $1.7 billion in tax cuts championed by Mr. Bush for the shortfall, and portraying the governor as having put short-term political interests ahead of the state's fiscal stability.

  At the City Hall here, where he announced a proposal to help local communities hire 10,000 more prosecutors, Mr. Gore began with a minor tutorial on the Texas budget.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Several days ago, we learned that under Governor Bush's leadership, Texas has suddenly gone from its biggest budget surplus ever to a budget shortfall, the most serious budget problem in almost a decade,'' Mr. Gore said in a speech at the City Council chamber here.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Now, we learn at a time of national prosperity -- indeed, the longest economic boom in the history of America -- that Texas has saved less for the future than almost every other state in America,'' Mr. Gore continued. ''The state's so-called Rainy Day Fund could barely withstand a drizzle. It's now so small that by this fall there will be only enough money to run the Texas state government for a single day. You know, there'd be a real problem if Texas had a rainy season.''

  Unlike the sprinkling of ultraconservative Republicans elected during the Goldwater boom, Mr. Coverdell was not hostile to black aspirations. Indeed, by the time he left the Georgia Senate in 1989, he had gained enough influence to make his mark as a reliable legislative advocate for Atlanta's black mayors. He was known as a policy wonk and a nice guy, traits that would mark his service as director of the Peace Corps under President George Bush. He worked hard in that position to promote a program that is unpopular with many Republicans because of its identification with President John F. Kennedy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It is, of course, always tricky to define political moderation among Southern Republicans. By any measure, Mr. Coverdell, a big booster of tax cuts and school vouchers, was plenty conservative. Lately he had grown close to Trent Lott, the Senate's tough-guy majority leader. But his primary alliances were with less hard-edged types like President Bush and his son George W. Bush, the Texas governor. He helped plan the coming Republican Convention. In the event of a Republican victory, according to Senator Max Cleland of Georgia, a Democrat, Mr. Coverdell ''would have played a big role in a Bush administration, in the cabinet or as a special adviser.'' But in a region that still tends to celebrate pols who are loud and flashy, Mr. Coverdell will be remembered for his general decency, his serious interest in good government and his unlikely leap from the back benches of the Georgia Capitol.

  Friends of Mr. Clinton said he is also intrigued with Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana because of Mr. Bayh's involvement with the Democratic Leadership Council -- a centrist group that Mr. Clinton once headed -- and because he would evoke a energetic and vibrant image, similar to when Mr. Clinton picked Mr. Gore in 1992.

  One person close to Mr. Clinton said the president spoke positively early on about William S. Cohen, a former Republican senator who is defense secretary.

 <textdata>
  (By The New York Times), CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, July 19 -- Mr. Gore said tonight that he wanted a vice president who would be much like himself, someone who has helped the president carry the load of a job so heavy that it ages the occupants of the Oval Office.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I have been able to help my country by strengthening President Clinton's hand and helping him in a thousand ways carry the heavy load that sometimes is pretty crushing for a president of the United States,'' Mr. Gore said here in response to a question at a town meeting.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore still refused to discuss any names publicly. ''I'm trying to keep the process as private and dignified as possible,'' he said, ''so that the ones that aren't picked aren't accidentally hurt in the process.''

  One assumes that publishers believe that this same reader beware was applicable to several other books published recently. Simon &amp; Schuster published ''Gone: The Last Days of The New Yorker,'' by Renata Adler, in which she casually dropped into the book that Judge John J. Sirica, who supervised the Watergate trial and who died in 1992, had ties to organized crime. The book included not a driplet of supporting evidence. Seven months later in Harper's magazine she has presented her argument to support the allegation, but finding proof in it was like searching for Robin Hood's barn, which no one ever found. Last year St. Martin's Press shredded an inaccurate biography of George W. Bush. Its vetting failed to uncover that the author, J. H. Hatfield, was convicted of hiring a hit man in an unsuccessful car bombing of his boss. And Random House agreed that significant changes were warranted in Jeffrey Toobin's ''Vast Conspiracy,'' another Clinton book, to correct factual errors. In 1998, Schocken Books, a Knopf imprint, suffered the ultimate absurdity: it printed 50,000 copies of a prize-winning nonfiction book first published in Germany that was entirely fiction. Called ''Fragments,'' it was said by its author, Binjamin Wilkomirski, to be a memoir of his time in Nazi camps. It was a hoax.

But is it worth it, given the inevitable public backlash over awarding hundreds of billions of dollars to those who need it the least?

  It's out of the mainstream -- and at odds with true Republican principles of fiscal responsibility -- to plunge back into deficit spending, as Governor Bush has in Texas with big tax cuts for the oil industry and others. It's out of the mainstream -- and at odds with traditional Republican standards of liberty -- to put the federal government between a woman and her doctor in matters of reproductive choice, as Governor Bush and the party would try to do by overturning Roe v. Wade. And it's out of the mainstream -- and at odds with Republican preference for government closest to the people -- to override local government efforts to limit sprawl and protect drinking water, as Governor Bush did by veto, or to side with gun makers against local attempts to hold them accountable for harm done.

  It was far from the American mainstream -- and at odds with talk of ''compassion'' -- to withhold medical insurance from 200,000 children, as Mr. Bush did for three years in a state that ranks rock-bottom last in family health coverage; to try to invade teachers' retirement funds; to oppose a hate crimes law even after a black man was dragged to death; and to allow concealed guns to be carried even into church.

  You report the exchange between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush regarding the hypothetical case of a pregnant woman facing execution (news article, July 18). Mr. Gore, you say, ''would let the woman decide whether the execution should be delayed, allowing her the option of whether or not to give birth.''  Mr. Bush ''said he would support postponing such an execution 'because there's a second life involved.' ''

  Among the biggest problems the parties face when organizing conventions is deciding whom to include on the speaking schedule. FreedomChannel.com, a nonpartisan site (www.freedomchannel.com), doesn't face the same time constraints, so it will offer video clips of prominent political figures who are not scheduled to speak at the convention. For example, the group is working to arrange a speech from Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida and a brother of George W. Bush.

  GETTING PERSONAL WITH BUSH -- For voters who were not feeling up close and personal enough with the candidacy of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the campaign unveiled a redesigned Web site, www.GeorgeWBush.com, with a new feature, ''My George W'' yesterday. It lets users receive e-mail messages from the campaign about issues of specific interest to them. The revised site, which includes sections like ''GWB TV,'' which is devoted to video clips of Mr. Bush, is being promoted in a novel way, too. The campaign says it is running the first political TV commercial intended solely to advertise a candidate's Web site. The unnarrated, 30-second spot scans the campaign's home page and supplies the address of the Web site, where users can also answer a daily trivia question and win Bush campaign souvenirs.

  ANTI-ABORTION PLANK -- Supporters of abortion rights said yesterday that they had told Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Republican platform committee, that they had not ruled out a floor fight to change the platform's strong anti-abortion stance. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed nominee, has said he favors keeping that language. But Susan Cullman, co-chairwoman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, said she and her colleagues told Mr. Thompson that their struggle would not end with the platform committee vote. Ms. Cullman said her group was reviewing its options -- one of which is to try to assemble a majority of six state delegations, necessary to make a motion to try to bring the issue to the floor.

  GORE AVOIDING GALA -- Al Gore may be the most invited guest to parties during the Democratic National Convention, but there is at least one he will not attend: a gala at the Playboy Mansion. ''We're not attending, participating, supporting, condoning or giving our imprimatur in any shape, way or form,'' Chris Lehane, spokesman for the Gore campaign, said Tuesday. The party is billed as a fund-raiser for the Hispanic Unity Caucus, which promotes voter registration among Latinos and is led by Representative Loretta Sanchez, a California Democrat and a close Gore ally. But the party at Hugh Hefner's playhouse, scheduled to coincide with the convention, has become a target of the Republicans, who have asserted that Representative Sanchez is out of touch with both her party and voters if she believes ''scantily dressed women and alcohol'' can help improve Latino participation in the electoral process. Representative Sanchez contends the party's ''high-profile venue'' will make it a sell-out event.

  UNEXPECTED GUESTS IN PHILADELPHIA -- Seeking to improve relations with the Republican Party and learn how to build a political party, emissaries from Russian's new president, Vladimir Putin, plan to attend the Republican Party's nominating convention in Philadelphia later this month. Representative Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, who is arranging the trip, says the group is following his advice to not ''put all your eggs in either party's basket.'' He is helping with the visit, he says, out of concern that Mr. Putin is becoming so closely identified with President Clinton and Democrats that Russia could become ''a whipping boy'' in this year's presidential election. Actually, the visit is just the latest overture by Putin allies to reach out to the Republican Party. The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met in April with Governor George W. Bush (much as Boris Yeltsin met with Democratic candidate Bill Clinton early in the 1992 campaign). Democratic officials say they know of no plans for Russians to visit their convention in Los Angeles.

  Publicly acknowledged disagreements? Leaks? These are almost nonexistent in Bush world, because most of the people who are allowed to enter it have declared or demonstrated their loyalty, an ethos as precious to Mr. Bush as any other, the coin of his political realm.

  ''Loyalty is the No. 1 criterion for him,'' said one Republican official who has known Mr. Bush for more than a decade. ''He would have loyalty over any other skill or characteristic in the people around him.''

  As Mr. Bush, the de facto Republican presidential nominee, nears the announcement of his running mate, unanswered questions swirl around what type of political and professional pedigree that person will have. But Mr. Bush and his advisers have made clear that one of the litmus tests the person will have passed is that he or she can be utterly faithful to the governor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Conversely, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma has maintained his position as one of the most-talked-about contenders largely because his mild manner and long friendship with Mr. Bush suggest that he would never try to contradict, usurp or eclipse the Texas governor, Republican officials said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even by the standards of politics, where discretion is always desired, Mr. Bush places an extremely high premium on loyalty, and it drives his important decisions -- helping to determine who gets his ear, who gets the top jobs around him and the terms of their relationships with him. Many of the senior people affiliated with his campaign had proven their commitment to him by forswearing other political allegiances or taking low salaries. Others had long histories with the Bush family.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At Mr. Bush's request, his chief strategist, Karl Rove, sold his consulting business so that his attention to the candidate would be undivided. Maverick Media, the advertising firm that produces Mr. Bush's television commercials, was brought into existence solely for the purpose of the Bush campaign and has no clients other than Mr. Bush, an unusual arrangement in presidential politics.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In an interview aboard his campaign plane on Tuesday, Mr. Bush said that what he had tried to do was build an efficient team, and that loyalty was its glue, binding people together so that they could focus on common goals without fear that colleagues would work against their interests.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''A disloyal person in the wrong position can undermine an administration,'' said Mr. Bush, seemingly alluding to the lessons that his friends and advisers said he learned from watching his father, former President George Bush, prevail when the lieutenants around him were true and struggle when they were not.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But several political analysts said that there was a potential downside to Mr. Bush's penchant for loyalists. One Republican strategist questioned whether Mr. Bush received advice that was tough and critical enough and whether he exposed himself to a wide enough range of opinions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another Republican official, describing Mr. Bush's closest advisers, observed: ''I've never seen a campaign where people don't sit around and psychoanalyze the guy. They never do that, even if you're having a drink with them. They never call him anything other than governor, and they never say anything even remotely close to disparaging.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's advisers say that their united public front should never be mistaken for a private acquiescence to his wants and whims.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I feel absolutely free to disagree with him,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the campaign's director of communications. Other advisers said that they, too, spoke their minds around Mr. Bush, but that the vigorous debates behind closed doors stayed there.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Hughes and other advisers said that Mr. Bush had earned their loyalty, supporting them as strongly as they support him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Speaking to reporters aboard his campaign plane recently, Mr. Bush said, ''There was never any question in my mind'' about changing his team. ''These are friends,'' he said. ''I know they're there for the right reason.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After Mr. Bush struggled in the primaries to turn back the insurgency of Mr. McCain, some analysts speculated that he would turn to a conventionally seasoned political operative to supplement the so-called iron triangle -- Mr. Rove, Ms. Hughes and Joe Allbaugh, the campaign manager -- who had also guided Mr. Bush's career in Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Instead, Mr. Bush asked one of his best and oldest friends, Donald L. Evans, an oil and gas company executive, to be the campaign chairman.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The tightness and endurance of Mr. Bush's advisers stand in contrast to the gyrations in Vice President Al Gore's operation, which Mr. Bush has monitored with a disapproving eye. During a taping of the television news program ''Hardball with Chris Matthews'' a month and a half ago, Mr. Bush predicted that Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, would not survive Mr. Gore's persistent disadvantage in most polls.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''They're going to dump him,'' Mr. Bush told Mr. Matthews during a commercial break. ''Mark my words. Oh, they'll dump him. There's no loyalty in those guys.'' (Mr. Coelho later stepped down after being hospitalized with an inflamed colon.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The unity of the Bush team differs as well from the revolving door that afflicted Bob Dole's presidential campaign four years ago, and it has enabled Mr. Bush to keep the news coverage of his campaign focused on the policies he is unveiling or the voters he is courting.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It also reflects Mr. Bush's lingering ire over the behavior of some aides and allies during  former President Bush's failed re-election effort. Mr. Bush said that when the going got tough, ''I saw them jumping out the windows in 1992, looking for the next campaign. And that influenced me. Yeah, that influenced me.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Friends said that Mr. Bush also learned to value loyalty from the example of his father, who swallowed ideological differences with Ronald Reagan to serve as his vice president from 1981 to 1989. After his father was elected to the presidency in 1988, George W. Bush was asked to head a committee with the task of making sure that people who had helped his father win were not overlooked for jobs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And friends are not being forgotten -- or forgetting the Bushes. Condoleezza Rice, a Russia specialist on the National Security Council under President Bush, is his son's chief foreign policy adviser. Richard B. Cheney, the defense secretary during the Bush administration, is supervising the process by which the Texas governor selects a vice president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-20-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  During a recent interview about his wife, Laura, Mr. Bush said: ''The other thing about Laura is that she's fiercely loyal. She's loyal to me. She's loyal to my dad. She's loyal to her children.'' It was clear, in the tone of his voice, that there was no praise any higher.

  BUSH LEAD GETS SMALLER -- Three new polls taken over the weekend indicate that Gov. George W. Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore is narrowing. A CBS News survey shows Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore 43 percent to 41 percent, down from his 47-to-39 edge in May. A Zogby poll has Mr. Bush holding a 45-to-41 lead, compared with a 47-to-39 edge a month ago. And a USA Today/ CNN Gallup poll has Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore 45 to 43, compared with 50 to 41 a week ago. The CBS poll covered 596 adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, meaning the Bush lead was statistically insignificant. Significantly, however, Mr. Bush's potential voters were more likely than his rival's to say they supported him enthusiastically. And when people who leaned to Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore were added to those firmly committed, Mr. Bush led 46 to 43. When Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party were added to the poll, Mr. Bush beat Mr. Gore 42 to 37, and Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan got 4 percent each. In the Zogby poll, which surveyed 890 likely voters and had a three percentage point sampling error, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore 43 to 37 when other candidates were added, with Mr. Nader getting 6 percent and Mr. Buchanan 3 percent. In the USA/CNN poll, which surveyed 1,063 registered voters over the weekend and has a four percentage point error margin, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore 45 to 43 when other candidates were added, with Mr. Nader picking up 5 percent and Mr. Buchanan 3 percent. The USA/CNN poll showed Mr. Gore gained support from women and independents in the past week, apparently helped by the endorsement of former Senator Bill Bradley.

  A BOOST FOR BOTH CANDIDATES -- Outside interest groups combined highly visible television advertising with below-radar phone calls, direct mail and radio to play a powerful role in Al Gore and George W. Bush's primary election victories, a new nonpartisan elections study, ''Getting Inside the Outside Campaign,'' has found. The study, financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts, found that in the Democratic race, labor unions provided Mr. Gore with crucial support in his contest with former Senator Bill Bradley, particularly in the leadoff Iowa caucuses. On the Republican side, the study found that conservative groups battered Senator John McCain of Arizona, particularly in South Carolina, helping Mr. Bush rebound from a crushing defeat in New Hampshire.

  This is the first presidential campaign in which the Republican candidate truly appears to be weighing whether to pick a No. 2 who supports abortion rights.

  Even so, Mr. Bush's overtures to politicians who favor abortion rights, namely Governors Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and George E. Pataki of New York, has decidedly scrambled the selection of a running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Several advisers to Mr. Bush said, for example, that Mr. Ridge would be at the top of the list were it not for his stand on abortion. Mr. Ridge is from an important state, has an impressive biography and, perhaps most importantly, gets along quite well with Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But one after another, Bush advisers expressed skepticism that the Pennsylvania governor would be picked. Mr. Bush is expected to make a decision in the next week or so. Of course, the only way to know is to get into Mr. Bush's head. That did not deter some advisers from predicting that he would settle for someone who is safely anti-abortion, like Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska or Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'd love to see it,'' said a Bush adviser who thinks Mr. Ridge would make an ideal running mate but is not worth the risk. ''But why would you throw a monkey wrench into the gears of your base?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He and other Bush loyalists said they were especially worried that choosing Mr. Ridge would infuriate the Catholic church, which they consider as much of a concern as the Christian Right.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, a CBS News Poll released today found that about a third of Mr. Bush's supporters said they would be less likely to vote for him if he picked a running mate who supported abortion. They would not vote at all -- or defect to Patrick J. Buchanan, the abortion opponent who is seeking the nomination of the Reform Party.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Ridge, in an interview, questioned Mr. Buchanan's potency. ''I don't think he's going to be factor,'' he said, ''And he's not about to push Governor Bush.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said in an interview that an abortion rights position should be ''no disqualifier'' for his brother. His choice favors abortion rights: Colin L. Powell. (But Bush aides said General Powell has made his disinterest clear.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, a minority of Bush advisers take issue with those who say Mr. Bush is less inclined to take a risk. They argue that because Mr. Bush is entering his convention ahead in the polls, he has more leeway to pick an abortion rights running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There are people who would say, 'Good for Bush!' '' said one Bush adviser who is pushing for Mr. Ridge.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet in the case of Mr. Ridge, several Bush advisers explained that the dangers were far deeper than the conventional wisdom that religious conservatives would squawk and perhaps frustrate efforts at harmony at the party's national convention that opens late this month. They would squawk.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But some advisers to Mr. Bush -- even ones who favor Mr. Ridge -- said the deeper concern was over the reaction from the Catholic church because the Pennsylvania governor is Catholic.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''They would not be able to hold functions in Catholic settings; Catholic colleges, Catholic high schools, Catholic institutions,'' said a Bush adviser who otherwise said Mr. Ridge would make the best choice. ''Every city that you were to go to, there would be bishops and cardinals who would protest.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000

  One Republican operative who recently discussed the selection process with Mr. Bush said, ''I don't think he's afraid of the Christian Right.''

  While Democrats grouse that Mr. Bush has a deeper bench of prospects than Al Gore, the vice president has the advantage of not having any single issue looming over his short list.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It could be, of course, that while his advisers are wrestling with the possibilities, Mr. Bush really never intended to pick an abortion rights candidate. Some advocates say Mr. Bush consideration of candidates who support abortion rights has been a shell game intended to stroke his friends and placate abortion right supporters.

  At first glance, that seemed to be what was happening when Mr. Bush met with Mr. Pataki on Friday. After all, no Bush adviser had dared to predict that the Texas governor could win New York. And Mr. Bush is even friendlier with Mr. Ridge than with Mr. Pataki.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But people close to Mr. Bush and Mr. Pataki said today that after the two had their meeting that morning, they privately met again over lunch. And some Bush advisers said the Texas governor appeared to be taking a close look at Mr. Pataki because, though he is Catholic, he has not had difficulties with Catholic leaders in the state as has Mr. Ridge.

  Mrs. Whitman and other abortion rights Republicans can take heart that Ronald Reagan picked a running mate in 1980 who -- unlike Mr. Reagan -- had opposed a constitutional prohibition against abortion. George Bush, the running mate, had little choice but to emphasize that he opposed abortion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But he squirmed a bit at his joint news conference with Mr. Reagan: ''Please do not try to keep reminding me of differences I had,'' Mr. Bush implored.

  The national debate over the death penalty took an odd turn today when Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas each discussed what to do in the hypothetical case of a pregnant woman facing execution.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For Mr. Bush, who has presided over more executions than any other governor in the country, it was a matter of pointing to the compassion in his conservatism. He said he would support postponing such an execution ''because there's a second life involved.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The question first came up on Sunday in an interview with Mr. Gore on the NBC News television program ''Meet the Press.'' The vice president, who backs the death penalty,  was asked whether he would support it if the condemned prisoner happened to be pregnant. Mr. Gore replied that he was unfamiliar with the issue and would have to examine it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At a news conference today shortly after rallying his troops in Nashville, where his presidential campaign makes its headquarters, Mr. Gore said he favored allowing a pregnant woman to choose whether to delay her execution until she gave birth.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At an earlier news conference in Little Rock, Ark., Governor Bush tweaked Mr. Gore for his answer in the television interview, saying he was ''surprised, frankly,'' that the vice president had needed time to think about the matter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore addressed the subject after flying here to his home state today, armed with new poll numbers showing his race with Mr. Bush growing tighter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He continued his attack on Mr. Bush's record in Texas and, in casting his own candidacy in classic Democratic terms as a fight for the disadvantaged, made personal reference to his childhood.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This theme, populist in nature and Democratic by tradition, dovetails with the policy formulations Mr. Gore has been developing over the last several weeks, particularly as he rails against the ''special interests'' like big oil that he says Mr. Bush is serving.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This was officially Commerce Secretary William M. Daley's first day  as Gore campaign chairman, and, in a Nashville briefing with campaign workers from around the country  that was closed to reporters, the vice president pointed to a new CNN/USA Today poll that showed him trailing Mr. Bush by only 2 points, 43 percent to 45 percent; that was considerably closer than last month's CNN poll, which had Mr. Gore trailing by 12 points. A new CBS poll also showed Mr. Gore narrowing the race to 2 percentage points, 41 percent to 43 percent; in mid-May, Mr. Gore trailed in that poll by 8 points.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After lunch with his mother and a  conference with campaign strategists, Mr. Gore greeted the dozens of workers who staff his Nashville headquarters. Standing on a chair, surrounded by the mostly college-age crowd, he adopted the language that his 26-year-old daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, uses to reach her under-30 audiences.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In appealing to their sense of idealism, Mr. Gore warned the young workers to avoid the ''ironic detachment'' that afflicts the cynical. He said some people became detached because they were afraid that if they gave their hearts to something, they would only be let down.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At his news conference later in the day before he flew on here to Memphis, Mr. Gore was asked how he would square his criticism that Mr. Bush had mismanaged the state budget in Texas with his earlier assertions that Mr. Bush was a weak governor who had little power.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''What power he does have he has used to ill effect,'' Mr. Gore replied. He called Mr. Bush's budget a ''two-page ditty'' that served only the special interests.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In defense of his record as governor, Mr. Bush has often noted that the people of Texas re-elected him in 1998 with nearly 70 percent of the vote. To that, Mr. Gore scoffed today,  ''People in the other 49 states vote in this election.''

  With the Republican National Convention two weeks away, Gov. George W. Bush began trying to build excitement about it today in his playful, teasing manner, saying for the first time that he was closing in on his selection of a running mate and letting his advisers dribble out details about a five-day trip he would make to the event.
 </textdata>

  At a news conference this morning in Little Rock, Ark., where he campaigned before heading here, Mr. Bush said he could no longer pretend that he was not busily winnowing the field of vice-presidential possibilities.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The days of saying the list is shrinking and growing are over,'' Mr. Bush said with a broad smile, referring to the coy refrain he had used until this point to answer questions about his deliberations. ''I'm getting closer to a decision.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Texas governor shed no light on what that decision would be, but the possible timing of it was made clearer in the details that his advisers released about the trip Mr. Bush would make to Philadelphia, where the four-day convention begins on July 31.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Karen P. Hughes, the director of communications for the Bush campaign, said the candidate would leave Austin, Tex., on July 28 and arrive in Philadelphia on Aug. 2, the day before he is expected to formally receive his party's presidential nomination and make his convention speech.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Hughes also said Mr. Bush would probably introduce his running mate in Austin, which suggested that the announcement would come just before he was scheduled to leave town, perhaps in the middle of next week. But she added that nothing was confirmed and that Mr. Bush still had not decided when he would make the announcement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  She noted that the Republican presidential nominee had not won any of those states between Texas and Pennsylvania since 1988 but that Mr. Bush believed he could prevail in most or all of them. Ms. Hughes said other states could be added to the trip.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At his news conference today, Mr. Bush also repeated a promise he and his advisers had made: that the Republican convention would look, feel and sound unlike previous ones.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's going to be a convention that is going to have some new wrinkles to it,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Immediately after the convention, several of Mr. Bush's advisers said today, the Texas governor would probably travel by train for several days of whistle-stop campaigning.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both Republicans and Democrats, whose national convention will be in mid-August, are working to make the spotlight that these events throw on the political parties and their presidential nominees last as long as possible and matter as much as possible. Vice President Al Gore is expected to include a boat trip through key states in the Midwest after the Democratic convention.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Before Mr. Bush's news conference in Little Rock, he unveiled a modest proposal designed to cast himself as an especially compassionate conservative, and he discussed it briefly at a private social services agency where he was flanked by African-Americans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said that if he were elected president, he would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to encourage states to set up registries for the fathers of children born out of wedlock, but he did not call for new federal spending to be directed explicitly toward that effort.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-18-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As Mr. Bush campaigned in Arkansas and Wisconsin today, he also continued to raise money for the Republican Party, bringing in an estimated $1.4 million at four events.

  It was 1978, and the 31-year-old Mr. Bush was trying to get a start in politics by running for Congress here in West Texas. A candidate forum was under way, and his rival was needling Mr. Bush with an oft-repeated joke in which he was the punchline, a yarn that reinforced a perception of him as a spoiled rich kid from back East.

  ''It was a Mercedes,'' drawled Mr. Hance, raising his eyebrows, and the audience tittered knowingly at the hint that Mr. Bush was the kind of man more comfortable in a Mercedes than a pick-up. ''The guy rolled down the window and wanted to know how to get to a certain ranch.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The audience roared with laughter, and just to be sure that the voters got the connection with the Connecticut-born Mr. Bush, Mr. Hance said he had noticed something else about the Mercedes: ''It had Connecticut license plates.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush lost that race for Congress. Yet the story of his entry into politics, and particularly of that campaign, suggests that it left a deep imprint on him, one evident today as he campaigns for the White House.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Back then, Mr. Bush ran an energetic but deeply flawed campaign. He chose a race that may have been unwinnable, and then let himself be portrayed to many voters as an over-educated phony out of touch with ordinary voters -- ironically, a bit the way some Bush supporters now look at Vice President Al Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Mr. Bush first entered the Congressional race, he was still single and struggling to start an oil company. He was not obvious Congressional material: he lived in a bachelor's flat, his bedframe tied together with one of his neckties, and he dressed exclusively in ratty denim or in clothes that did not match.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush campaigned feverishly from morning to night in his white Oldsmobile Cutlass, usually running late, his volunteers sitting beside him and struggling to domesticate him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Older people were sometimes put off by what they saw as Mr. Bush's cockiness, but the young volunteers were dazzled by his enthusiasm. ''No matter how late the activities of the previous evening, he was always up early the next morning and working in a way I'd rarely seen in Lubbock,'' said J. Michael Weiss, whom Mr. Bush met while shaking hands at a shopping mall and turned into a volunteer county chairman.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000

 <textdata>
  George W. Bush is often seen today as a very late entrant into politics; he is running for president after holding elective office for just five years. Yet in another sense, he has been engaged in politics one way or another since his teens and has considered various runs for office since his 20's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was first exposed to politics at the age of 17, when his father ran for the Senate, and later he worked full-time on Senate campaigns in Florida for Edward J. Gurney and in Alabama for Winton M. Blount, nicknamed Red. The lure of these campaigns was not policy but the adventure of a statewide campaign; a friend recalls Mr. Bush saying that he spent his time in Alabama drinking and dating.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Diane Paul, a girlfriend of Mr. Bush when he was in his mid-twenties, said that Mr. Bush was fascinated even then by politics and searching for a way to run for office.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In 1971, when he was 25, Mr. Bush found a spot. A seat in the Texas State Senate was coming open in Houston the next year, and he chewed over with friends the idea of running for it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So Mr. Bush went off to Harvard Business School and then started business in 1975 as an oilman in Midland, the West Texas city where he had spent his childhood. Just two years later, a terrific opportunity seemed to tumble into his lap. George Mahon, the local Democratic congressman, announced his retirement after 43 years in the House.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was a useful marriage. For a candidate like Mr. Bush who some saw as a rootless and immature carpet-bagger, it was helpful politically to settle down and start a family, particularly with a local girl who was an authentic West Texan. But the young couple seemed absolutely in love as they roared around the district on the campaign trail, and there was almost no muttering about the sheer political convenience of it all.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What drew Mr. Bush into politics?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In an interview, he rejected the suggestion that he had followed his father into politics, saying instead that he had been angry at Carter administration policy on natural gas pricing. But in a 1995 conversation with a historian, Herbert S. Parmet, Mr. Bush emphasized the degree to which his own family legacy pushed him into the political world.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There is a passing on of tradition, passing on legacy, passing on responsibility,'' Mr. Bush said then, according to Professor Parmet's transcript of the conversation. ''So I don't think it's a conscious effort. I don't think it's any of this thing where, you know, 'by God, young man, if you play your cards right you, too, may end up in politics.' It's more of an inherent trait.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush may not have had a decent suit when he announced his candidacy, but he had other assets -- among them a first-rate name. George Bush had been a prominent name in Texas ever since his father had begun his political career in 1964 with a campaign for the Senate and then, after losing, served two terms as a congressman from Houston.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The elder Bush ran for the Senate unsuccessfully again in 1970, but by then his star was rising in the Republican Party: he was mentioned three times as a possible vice president -- twice for President Richard M. Nixon, once for President Gerald R. Ford --  and became famous by holding a series of posts like ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee and director of central intelligence.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The younger Mr. Bush's key supporters in the 1978 campaign were his buddies in Midland, people like Donald L. Evans, who is now the chairman of his presidential campaign. In addition, friends of the father helped out the son or contributed money.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It would have been difficult to imagine an unknown 31-year-old who had barely held a job running for Congress -- had it not been for Mr. Bush's name and his family connections. But it soon became apparent that there was also a downside to this pedigree.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The other candidate in the Republican primary runoff, Jim Reese, the courtly and conservative mayor of Odessa, initiated attacks on Mr. Bush using themes that still reverberate today. Indeed, some of the epithets later attributed to Ann Richards when she competed -- and lost -- against Mr. Bush in the 1994 contest for governor, like Junior or Shrub, were first used by Mr. Reese in 1978.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Sensitive to the perception that he was simply playing on his name and background -- a sensitivity that continues to this day -- Mr. Bush asked his father not to campaign for him and played down the connection.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We don't need Dad in this race,'' Mr. Bush told The Midland Reporter-Telegram. ''We don't need anyone in this race but the people of this district.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet the Congressional primary runoff became a proxy battle between two national Republican giants, for Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush were dueling in preparation for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination, and Mr. Reagan did not want a Bush family victory in Texas. Mr. Reagan contributed $3,000 from his own political action committee to Mr. Reese's campaign and taped a television commercial for him. This infuriated the Bush family.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm not interested in getting into an argument with Reagan,'' the elder Mr. Bush told The Washington Post at that time. ''But I am surprised about what he is doing here, in my state.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''They are making a real effort to defeat George,'' Mr. Bush added indignantly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We were going broke farming, and we were fighting anything that was keeping us down,'' recalled J. C. Lewis, an Oklahoma farmer and retired Air Force pilot who flew down to Texas to campaign against Mr. Bush in small towns like Wolfforth.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The most common interpretation of the 1978 campaign is that Mr. Bush was a wonderful campaigner and natural-born politician. But this seems to be a gloss burnished by time and the selective memories of Mr. Bush and his friends.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Here in West Texas people say that Mr. Bush was personable and a quick study but still made a series of mistakes, largely through inexperience.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For example, there was the day, early in the campaign, at a candidate forum on a farm near the town of Dimmitt. ''Today is the first time I've been on a real farm,'' Mr. Bush said, beaming at the crowd.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Then there was the TV commercial Mr. Bush dreamed up to demonstrate how energetic he was: it showed him jogging on a track. In those days, joggers were about as common in West Texas as Martians.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''In his campaign in '78, I didn't get the feeling that he had the knack for it,'' Mr. Angelo said of Mr. Bush. Since then, Mr. Angelo has revised his opinion and now believes Mr. Bush has tremendous political instincts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the end, Mr. Bush beat Mr. Reese handily in the Republican primary, taking 56 percent of the vote.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''George has been underestimated every time,'' Mr. Reese reflected the other day, as he sat on a couch in his home in Odessa. ''I did it initially. Ann Richards did it in the governor's race. And Al Gore may be doing that now.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While Mr. Bush now is sometimes mocked for an ignorance of policy details, back then people thought he had the opposite problem: a tendency to drop references in his speeches that baffled audiences, like a discussion of anti-inflationary economic policy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another problem was that while Mr. Bush never really had a clear campaign strategy, Mr. Hance did: he focused his campaign on emphasizing local ties and on casting Mr. Bush as a carpet-bagger from the East. One of Mr. Hance's most effective radio spots was this one, read by an announcer:
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''In 1961, when Kent Hance graduated from Dimmitt High School in the 19th congressional district, his opponent George W. Bush was attending Andover Academy in Massachusetts. In 1965, when Kent Hance graduated from Texas Tech, his opponent was at Yale University. And while Kent Hance graduated from University of Texas Law School, his opponent'' -- the announcer's voice plunged -- ''get this, folks, was attending Harvard. We don't need someone from the Northeast telling us what our problems are.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Otice A. Green, a long-time political consultant who has worked on campaigns since 1956 -- including Mr. Hance's in 1978 -- said that Mr. Bush made a ''good entry'' into politics and was an impressive candidate. But, he added: ''Kent Hance was one of the best I ever saw.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It would have helped Mr. Bush if Republicans had united around him and vouched for him as a genuine West Texan. In retrospect, several Republicans think Mr. Bush should have tried much harder to get Mr. Reese's strong backing for the general election.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>

  Mr. Bush spent a third more than Mr. Hance in the general election campaign, but the extra spending played into the Democrats' hands. Mr. Hance denounced Mr. Bush for getting 64 percent of his campaign contributions from outside the district.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush complained that Mr. Hance's numbers were wrong. Over all, he said, only 48 percent of the money came from contributors outside the district.

  ''We've been attacked for where I was born, for who my family is, and where my money has come from,'' The Midland Reporter-Telegram quoted Mr. Bush as saying. ''I don't think that's fair.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and Mr. Hance did not have any particular ideological or policy disagreement. Indeed, The Reporter-Telegram wrote that at one appearance the two men were asked what difference there was between them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Well,'' Mr. Bush said finally, ''I've got more hair.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  ''Hance would have made a good Republican,'' Mr. Bush told the audience.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000

 <textdata>
  ''And Bush would have made a good conservative Democrat,'' Mr. Hance affirmed.

  Mr. Bush's father was appalled that his membership in the Trilateral Commission was hurting his son's candidacy. So he wrote to Mr. McCathern, the farm organizer, and suggested a meeting to clear the air.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They had a ''very, very affable meeting'' in Houston, Mr. McCathern said, and Mr. Bush resigned from the Trilateral Commission a few days before the election. But if the elder Bush kept his cool over the issue, the son occasionally lost his.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mel Turner, a local radio personality and a Republican, said he was leaning toward Mr. Bush but was troubled by the matter of the Trilateral Commission. At a candidate forum at the Branding Iron restaurant in Odessa, Mr. Turner stood up and asked Mr. Bush about the Trilateral Commission and whether his father was working for one-world government.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Junior Bush comes up, refused to shake my hand, looked me square in the eye and said, 'you . . . ' '' using a crude epithet, Mr. Turner recalled. ''Then Kent Hance came up and said, 'Mel, I'll see you up at the Tech game.'''

  Late in the campaign, disaster struck the Bush forces.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Five days before the election, a law partner of Mr. Hance wrote a public letter denouncing the Bush campaign for using alcohol to lure young people. The letter went to 4,000 members of the Church of Christ in Lubbock, and copies were put under windshield wipers of cars of people attending church services.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Kent's opponent, young Mr. Bush, apparently is using tactics to secure votes which do not indicate the same high character,'' the letter declared. ''Mr. Bush has used some of his vast sums of money in an attempt, evidently, to persuade young college students to vote for and support him by offering free alcohol to them.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush called a news conference in which he fumed: ''His campaign has been funny. First he attacked my family, then my background, and now my morals.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Supporters of Mr. Bush found out that Mr. Hance owned a building that was leased to Fat Dawgs, a bar in Lubbock. Some of Mr. Bush's friends urged him to accuse Mr. Hance of hypocrisy, but he refused; voters would reward a candidate who took the high road, he told supporters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A few days later, Mr. Bush was defeated, 53 percent to 47 percent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Of course, if Mr. Bush had won, it might not have been the best thing for his career. He would have become part of the Washington establishment, and would not have cultivated the beyond-the-beltway aura that has been his strength since he re-entered politics by running for governor in 1994.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As for Mr. Hance, he ran for the United States Senate in 1984 but lost and ended up a  lawyer in Austin -- and a supporter of the Bushes. Mr. Hance recalled that while in Congress, he met another young Southern Democrat, a Tennessean named Al Gore, and grew friendly with him. After seeing both men in action, he concluded that Mr. Bush is a far more effective campaigner.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm convinced that Bush is going to be beat him and beat him soundly,'' Mr. Hance said. ''I served with Gore and I know him, and I like him. But I'd hate to ride from Lubbock to Los Angeles with him. If you rode from Lubbock to Los Angeles with Bush, it'd be loads of fun. And Gore'd be saying things like, 'I see some mountains.' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So what did Mr. Bush learn from his first political contest? How did it change him?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It was an interesting lesson,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview. ''Sometimes there are races you just can't win.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another lesson, some of Mr. Bush's friends say, is the need to respond forcefully to accusations like those about the ''Bush bash.'' The high road may be honorable, he discovered, but it does not necessarily lead to elective office.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  More broadly, that first campaign taught Mr. Bush, as his old pal Mr. O'Neill puts it, ''don't let your opponent define you.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Hance believes he taught Mr. Bush two lessons. First, he said, he showed Mr. Bush the need to cultivate the religious right, those church-goers who he had largely ignored during the campaign and who in the end voted against him on the alcohol issue.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And second, he thinks, he helped teach Mr. Bush the need to be more folksy.

  DEMOCRATS DRILL FOR OIL -- No sooner had Dick Cheney been selected as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate than the Democratic National Committee put up a Web site, www.bush-cheney.net, as a parody of the team. With a graphic of an oil well gushing dollars, the Web site says the two men are ''covered with money from Big Oil'' and features statements that Mr. Cheney's Congressional voting record is more conservative than that of Jesse Helms. A committee spokesman said the site went up minutes after Mr. Cheney's selection was announced and, so far, it has received more than 15,000 hits. The Bush campaign, which has acquired a large number of domain names to prevent parody sites, had apparently never purchased the Bush-Cheney combination. ''We like to think of our site as like 'Dragnet','' said the committee spokesman, ''It's just the facts, ma'am.''

  KEYES BACKS BUSH TICKET -- He did not win a single presidential primary or caucus, but Alan Keyes, the hard-right radio talk show host, stayed on the campaign trail long after it was certain that Gov. George W. Bush was going to be the Republican nominee. Winning or losing was not as important to him, he insisted, as spreading his message that the nation must rededicate itself to moral principles and especially to outlawing abortion. But late Tuesday in Boston, Mr. Keyes, the only black candidate in the 2000 presidential field, pulled out of the race. Asked if he still considered himself a candidate with just a week to go before Mr. Bush is formally nominated in Philadelphia, he replied: ''I am not.'' He said he would back the Bush-Cheney ticket, noting that Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, were strong opponents of abortion.

  GORE AHEAD IN NEW JERSEY -- In New Jersey, which both parties view as a crucial electoral battleground, Vice President Al Gore continues to hold a slight lead over Gov. George W. Bush, according to the latest Quinnipiac  University poll. The survey of 910 registered voters taken July 19-24, with a margin of sampling error of three percentage points, shows Mr. Gore with a lead of 46 percent to 41 percent in a one-on-one race. When small-party candidates are included, Mr. Gore's lead is 42-38 over Mr. Bush, with 7 percent for Ralph Nader and 2 percent for Patrick J. Buchanan. The survey was taken before Mr. Bush's choice of Dick Cheney, who opposes abortion, as his running mate, but the poll suggested that choosing a vice presidential candidate who favored abortion rights would have done little to help Mr. Bush in New Jersey: 15 percent said they would have been more likely to vote Republican, 15 percent less likely, and 66 percent said it would have made no difference.

  And yet a rigorous analysis by the nonpartisan Century Foundation of Mr. Bush's proposal to allow workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts has determined that the plan would either worsen the system's long-term deficit or lead to substantial cuts in Social Security benefits, or both.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The analysis of Mr. Bush's plan was conducted by Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; Alan Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Alicia Munnell of Boston College; and Peter Orszag, president of Sebago Associates, an economics and public policy consulting firm.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The authors went on: ''Governor Bush has promised not to raise payroll taxes or invest the trust fund in stocks. He also has proposed tax cuts that would consume virtually the entire projected non-Social Security surplus, leaving no room for transfers to Social Security without causing a non-Social Security deficit. Governor Bush's plan would therefore have to rely on cutting Social Security benefits.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The authors based their analysis on a diversion of two percentage points of the current Social Security payroll tax into individual retirement accounts. And they assumed an inflation-adjusted rate of return on the accounts of 5.9 percent annually, which matched the assumption of Martin Feldstein, an advocate of retirement accounts and a top adviser to Governor Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The conclusion,'' the authors wrote, ''is that Governor Bush's proposal could cut Social Security benefits by more than 50 percent for young workers, and the proceeds from the individual accounts would (on average) make up only a portion of that cut while exposing individuals to significant risk.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The study said: ''These estimates are based on assumptions we believe understate the likely reductions in Social Security benefits. Even with these favorable assumptions, the results are dramatic: Governor Bush's plan requires substantial reductions in Social Security benefits and increased exposure to market risks for future retirees. Indeed, the implied reductions in Social Security benefits for future retirees are so substantial, they raise questions about the viability of protecting benefits for current retirees, older workers, disabled workers, and survivors while diverting payroll taxes into individual accounts.''

  ''There can be absolutely no doubt that voters will go to the polls choosing between two very different visions for our future,'' Mr. Gore said. ''It is the choice between the old guard that gave us deficits, division and social injustices, and a new vision for prosperity and progress, investment, inclusion and growth to lift up all of our people.''

  In introducing Mr. Gore today, Mr. Jackson -- once a bitter rival who has become his close ally -- asserted that the Clinton administration's policies had improved the lives of black families. But he also warned that ''prosperity fatigue'' might be creating apathy among black voters. And then he opened a slashing attack on Mr. Cheney, a former five-term congressman from Wyoming and secretary of defense under President George Bush, the governor's father.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore acknowledged that concern, saying, ''I do give our opponents some credit'' for their tactics.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also raised questions about Mr. Bush's commitment to civil rights, recalling that the governor had supported South Carolina's right to fly the Confederate battle flag over its state house.

  ''He took a look up there at the flag pole,'' the vice president said of Mr. Bush. ''He saw the American flag; he saw the dome. But he did not see a symbol of injustice and oppression. Something was wrong with his vision.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his remarks today, Mr. Gore avoided the raspy, high-energy Southern-preacher speaking style he sometimes assumes when addressing black audiences. Instead, he spoke in a calm, almost easy-going voice as he delved into his confessional themes.

  ''Dick and I both have roots in the West,'' Mr. Bush of Texas told a chanting crowd packed into the gymnasium of the high school Mr. Cheney, 59, attended more than 40 years ago. ''The West is a place full of straightforward people who usually say what they mean and mean what they say.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Then Mr. Bush reached back to one of President Clinton's well-known evasions in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. ''The West is full of people who understand the meaning of what the word 'is' is,'' he said.

  A day after Mr. Bush announced that he had selected his father's former defense secretary as his running mate, the Texas governor was quickly hit with questions about Mr. Cheney's voting record in his six terms in the House. He and the Gore campaign engaged in a fierce cross-country competition to define what  voters thought about Mr. Cheney.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000

 <textdata>
  ''I obviously thought about the record,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And this is a conservative man. So am I.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  The governor and his aides said the selection of Mr. Cheney showed that Mr. Bush was putting political considerations aside to make a sober-minded decision on a running mate who could serve as commander in chief.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He brings some strength to the administration,'' Mr. Bush said in a  news conference.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It speaks volumes that I'm willing to pick somebody who is as strong a man as he is,'' Mr. Bush said, ''that I'm comfortable with having excellence by my side.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Democrats also said the choice spoke volumes, about whether Mr. Bush really is a new kind of Republican or a throwback to the past. They pointed to Mr. Cheney's  conservative voting record as well as his service in the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and George Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm very proud of Halliburton,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''I have nothing to apologize for.'' He described it as a company that had started small as the brainchild of one man and become ''the quintessential American success story.'' Mr. Bush said his opponents were trying to ''divert attention from the fact that the Democrats have no energy policy.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign presented the trip to Natrona High School as a sentimental journey to the hometown where Mr. Cheney met his wife, Lynne. He was the class president and a captain of the football team. She was the prom queen, and as Mr. Bush added today, a ''nationally ranked champion baton twirler.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Gov. Jim Geringer warmed up the audience and dismissed the talk of Mr. Cheney's voting record. ''I'd rather have Vice President Cheney with his heart, than President Gore with no backbone,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-27-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was Mr. Bush, not his running mate, who seemed in a feisty mood. As he brought Mr. Cheney down the aisle of his campaign plane, reporters asked the governor what he thought of the Democrats' reaction to Mr. Cheney.

  In his presidential campaign, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has declared illiteracy a ''national emergency,'' a view that his opponent, Vice President Al Gore has said he shares. To tackle it under a federal-state program called Even Start, Congress and the Clinton administration have increased aid to state literacy projects by nearly 50 percent, to $150 million, in three years.

  George W. Bush's choice of Dick Cheney as his vice-presidential running mate sends a clear signal to the American people. Mr. Cheney's Congressional voting record demonstrates that he is an extreme conservative on critical issues like a woman's right to an abortion, gun control, the environment and civil rights.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  In sum, Mr. Bush's choice of Mr. Cheney shows that the best that Mr. Bush could find for a running mate in this remarkable age of diversity was a retread from his father's era. Clearly, Mr. Bush and the Republicans represent a chilling threat to the most basic social advances that the United States and its people have made over the last century.

  Mr. Cheney's long voting record in the House of Representatives was categorically and unambiguously pro-life, pro-military and strong defense, and pro-tax cuts. In fact, Mr. Cheney's voting history is the kind of pattern that historians will label as having belonged to a Reagan conservative. If anything, his voting pattern in Congress was at odds not with Reagan conservatism but with the Nixon-Ford wing of the Republican Party, from which he came. In answer to the question, ''Is Bush leaving Reaganism behind?'', the answer -- at least in the choice of Dick Cheney -- is clearly no.

Standardized tests -- increasingly linked to grade promotion, graduation, even teachers' salaries and the tenure of principals -- are the single biggest thing to have hit American education since Sputnik. Responding to the understandable demands for more ''accountability,'' almost every school in the land is morphing into a test-taking factory. Both Al Gore and George W.

  ''It is time for the Congress to listen to the people and not the powerful,'' Mr. Gore said, speaking in an incongruously soft voice to about 300 people in the ornate auditorium of Central Connecticut State University. ''It's time for them to do something instead of doing nothing. I've heard from people all over this country who can't wait for them to work up the gumption to come out from under the thumb of the special interests.''

  Mr. Gore said that Congress, in which he served for 16 years, was controlled by big oil, big drug companies, big insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and that Mr. Bush, who has so far largely sidestepped association with Congressional Republicans, was doing the bidding of these industries.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''Governor Bush, who is now head of the Republican Party, says nothing about this,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and his silence aids and abets the do-nothing Republican-led Congress and the same special interests who are contributing so much to his own campaign: the H.M.O.'s, the insurance companies, the pharmaceutical companies, the oil companies and the big polluters.''

  G. Donald Ferree Jr., director of the poll, said in an interview that Mr. Gore appeared to be falling back on the strategy of attacking big institutions because he was having a hard time overcoming the perception that Mr. Bush was more likable and was stronger on personal matters like leadership and credibility.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Going after Bush personally is not working and may not seem fair,'' Mr. Ferree said. ''The less Gore focuses on personality, the better for him. It's better for Gore not to treat him as a person but to treat him as a front for the Republicans. The Congress is impersonal.''

  ''I am here to fight to protect Connecticut's voters from deceptive politics,'' Senator Lieberman told the audience. ''Don't let yourself be cheated by Republican offers that sound good but don't deliver. Don't let yourself be cheated by statements that seem centrist but in the end end up on the fringes, that talk the compassionate talk but, believe me, I've looked at the details, simply do not walk the compassionate walk. Al Gore is the real thing.''

  BUDGET PROBLEMS IN TEXAS  One thing George W. Bush has known in his more than five years as governor of Texas is prosperity. But now the State of Texas is facing a budget shortfall of as much as $750 million, fueled by deficits in Medicaid and other state programs and rising costs for prison inmates, according to The Houston Chronicle. Members of the Legislative Budget Board, which oversees the budget, are scheduled to meet privately with state budget officials today to plan an emergency appropriations bill for January. Rob Junell, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the state's economy would provide enough new revenues to cover the shortfall.

  AN UNLIKELY RUNNING MATE  Gov. Gray Davis of California came just inches yesterday from ruling himself out of the running to be Al Gore's ticket mate. Mr. Davis has frequently been mentioned as a possible choice, someone whose considerable popularity in the Golden State could help Mr. Gore win its biggest-of-all trove of electoral votes. But the job has not been offered to him, he said in an interview, and therefore he would not address a theoretical question about whether he would accept it. ''However,'' he went on, ''what I will say is that I told the people of California when they elected me in 1998 that I would serve a full four-year term, and that is what I intend to do.''

  Thomas L. Friedman suggests that Al Gore pick Bill Clinton as his running mate (''A Modest Proposal,'' column, July 7). The same reasoning suggests that George W. Bush should pick his father, the former president. The selection of George H. W. Bush would save the duplication of Secret Service teams. Also, his background has been checked, and he has the added advantage of compensating for his son's weak grasp of foreign policy.

  ''Those with lesser rank bumped him up to me because they were scared of making a mistake,'' said Dess Stokes, the staff sergeant on duty at the Newark Armed Forces Entrance and Examination Station, where Mr. Gore went to enlist, hoping to avoid notice, in August 1969. ''We all knew who he was because of his daddy opposing the war.''

  No less than the Army's highest-ranking officer, Gen. William C. Westmoreland, singled him out during a visit to Fort Rucker, Ala., where Mr. Gore was stationed for more than a year. The Army chief of staff stopped in the middle of a ceremony to pull the young man aside for a private chat -- and kept Mr. Gore's superior officers waiting, and watching, while he asked one of the lowest-ranking men on the base for his thoughts on why so many young people opposed the war.

  Yet there is no evidence that Mr. Gore sought special treatment, or that the extra notice he got anyway provided any real protection. On the contrary, as an Army journalist, Mr. Gore probably assumed more risk than he had to, choppering around South Vietnam interviewing soldiers who had just seen action.
 </textdata>

  ''Anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on his butt and he didn't,'' said Michael Roche, Mr. Gore's editor on The Castle Courier, the newspaper of the Army's Engineering Command in Long Binh, near Saigon. Among 30 or 40 part-time correspondents and 3 or 4 reporters, Mr. Roche said, ''I didn't have one who traveled as much as he did.''
 </textdata>

  And if Mr. Gore has a dirty secret from Vietnam, it is not that he spent his tour hiding in headquarters, but that he found much of the experience exhilarating and loved feeling ''more alive,'' to use his words, in the middle of the war that he and millions of other Americans hated.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Gore is drawn to vividness, and though he is generally regarded as cautious, he has also, throughout his life, been a little bit attracted to risk and speed, practicing water-skiing stunts as a kid in Tennessee, riding his motorcycle too fast around Harvard -- or taking off in a helicopter near the DMZ with his legs dangling out the side.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When asked about an Army friend's comment that he had a lot of fun in Vietnam, Mr. Gore said: ''You aren't supposed to say that, I guess. There was always the awareness of why you were there and what was going on. But in the sense of the camaraderie and the vividness again? In many ways, you're more alive.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Those who knew Mr. Gore as a child remember his home life as rigorous, achievement-oriented and more focused on doing than feeling. His mother, Pauline LaFon Gore, recalled that the night Albert Gore lost his Senate seat in 1970 was one of the only times she ever saw her son cry. Recently, he was telling the story of his mother's being stranded in downtown Washington immediately after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. But when his interviewer remarked that the looting and smashing of windows must have been scary for her, he offhandedly said no, he didn't believe he'd ever seen his mother show fear.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000

 <textdata>
  One Army friend said Vietnam seemed to draw Mr. Gore out emotionally -- providing no shortage of what he himself called the vividness that made him feel more alive.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has occasionally added a splash of color to the tableau when describing his military service. Years ago, he told reporters he was shot at in Vietnam when he was not -- an exaggeration that may have been less an attempt to mislead than to make his experience more vivid.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When asked about those statements, Mr. Gore said only this, ''I wasn't shot at, but I was in areas where there was firing.'' He mentioned a trip with Mike O'Hara, now a sportswriter for The Detroit News, to Khe Sanh, near the DMZ, where Army engineers were re-opening an abandoned airstrip.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''They sent in the infantry to secure it and there were helicopter gunships firing,'' Mr. Gore added. ''My buddy kidded me for digging a foxhole, but there was firing in the hills surrounding there. It wasn't aimed at me, but I wasn't sure of that.'' Mr. O'Hara, Mr. Gore's closest friend in Vietnam, has said he recalls gunfire, too -- all outgoing.

  Al Gore's military record is in no particular need of improvement. He was one of only about a dozen of the 1,115 Harvard graduates in the Class of '69 who went to Vietnam. And even before enlisting, he passed up a chance to serve in the National Guard -- the military option chosen by his presidential opponent, George W. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  A cousin of Mr. Gore said she and her then-husband had secured the promise of a place for him in the Alabama Guard. ''I had friends who had gone to Vietnam, and one who had come back a paraplegic, and I was beside myself wanting to keep Al out of there,'' said the cousin, Gayle Byrne, of Birmingham, who grew up near Carthage, Tenn., where the Gores spent summers on their farm. So Ms. Byrne's former husband, a member of the Guard, asked a well-placed contact to hold a spot for Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The decision was complicated by his father's coming Senate race, which everyone knew would be tough, in large part because of Senator Gore's stand against the war. Though Albert Gore voted to authorize American involvement in August 1964, by the end of that year he was pushing for a negotiated settlement with the Communists.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000

 <textdata>
  Though Mr. Gore said his assignment as an Army journalist came as a complete surprise, Mr. Tyson recalled that ''the reason people enlisted was to have a greater ability to pick'' their job, an assessment Army historians say is accurate. A family friend recalled that Mr. Gore surveyed the options and hoped to serve as an Army journalist.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Highly credentialed enlisted men generally got their choice of assignments, and with his Harvard degree, Army officials said, Mr. Gore never ran any real risk of being assigned to the infantry.

  ''She and Al were like Lou Grant and Mary Tyler Moore,'' cracked Maurice Hendrick, who worked there with Mr. Gore and later became mayor of Rutherford, N.C. ''She'd been there 1,000 years and was very firm and no-nonsense,'' while Mr. Gore, in the ingenue role, worked hard and aimed to please.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The real goal was to obscure the news. ''If there was a helicopter crash, you couldn't put that on the front page,'' said Gus Stanisic, who served with Mr. Gore and edited the paper. ''You couldn't dwell on fatalities.''
 </textdata>

  That May, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson were married in Washington's National Cathedral, Al in his dress blues, Tipper in a formal, high-necked gown. Then he brought his new bride back to Alabama, where home was a 10-foot wide ''Expando model'' trailer.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There was a sweetness to this anxious time, though. The night before a friend, Bob Delabar, shipped out for Vietnam, Mr. Gore spent hours crawling around on a highway median looking for a four-leaf clover -- a talisman Mr. Delabar said he carried to Vietnam and back, until it finally disintegrated in his wallet.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was waiting to go to Vietnam, too. All his friends remember that he wanted to go, and the usual course of a two-year hitch in the Army included a year there.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000

 <textdata>
  The Gore family could never prove their suspicions, denied by various Nixon administration officials, that Mr. Gore's orders were deliberately held up. At the time, his Army buddies said, they were convinced President Nixon would not allow him to go to Vietnam -- not while there was even a slight chance it might do Senator Gore some political good should something bad happen to his son. But the fact that Mr. Gore was eventually sent to Vietnam with only seven months left to serve in his hitch was highly unusual. In the end, Mr. Gore shipped out the month after the election.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Brock, who went on to serve as chairman of the Republican Party, then as Trade Representative and Secretary of Labor in the Reagan administration, would later express regrets for his campaign. His slogan,  ''Bill Brock believes in the things we believe in,'' was a bald appeal to disaffected supporters of George Wallace, and his campaign made Senator Gore out to be a turncoat son of the South.

  On election night, Albert Gore gave a concession speech conceding nothing. ''The truth shall rise again!'' he told supporters, in what has been interpreted as a reference to the promise of his son's future. Those who knew the senator, though, feel he was too lost in his own pain that night to have been thinking any such thing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000

 <textdata>
  Though Mr. Gore no doubt learned a great deal from his father, who died in 1998, that one campaign shaped Mr. Gore's own public life to a remarkable extent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Really? Even though some of the same people who defeated your father were coming after you and President Clinton? Asked again, Mr. Gore let loose, sounding much more like the son of an old Tennessee populist than he usually does: ''One thing I did learn in the aftermath of that election is that the people you're fighting for should not have their interests damaged and overturned by superior fund-raisers and political activities on the other side!'' he said, almost shouting. ''You owe it to them! The wealthy and the powerful will always have more money, but if you can even the odds? You can't let them down, because they're depending on you.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore then offered another way the 1970 campaign stayed with him. His father, he said, ''was accused during that race of losing touch with his constituency, which wasn't true, but later when I was in Congress I believe I held what was the all-time record for town hall meetings. And nobody ever said that about me, not even unfairly.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Which may also explain why Mr. Gore's long campaign days so often end in some deserted hall where he has stayed late to answer every straggler's question -- long after Mr. Bush and most other Americans have knocked off for the evening.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Whether the 1970 campaign also made Mr. Gore a more cautious politician is less clear. His father got out in front of his constituents -- on race and the war and the separation between church and state -- and lost his seat.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a new forward to the book, which was reissued this spring, Mr. Gore wrote, ''For those who want to attack my view, let me the save you the trouble of reading the entire book. On pages 325 and 326, I wrote: 'It ought to be possible to establish a coordinated global program to accomplish the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine over, say, a 25-year period.' It is possible; it needs to be done; it will create more jobs, not destroy jobs. I'm proud that I wrote those words, and I reaffirm them today.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said his father taught him when to play it safe and when to go for it: ''My father told me, 'Son, you have to pick the walls you're going to butt your head against.' He meant some issues are so tough that if you take on the overwhelming opinion of the majority in your district you better keep track of how much damage you're doing to your ability to accomplish constructive change. Very few people will talk about that, but it's something we all have to think about.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Politicians cannot apply that standard to every single issue, he said -- an acknowledgment that is obvious but also pretty nervy. As an example of an issue to which he has applied a less stringent standard over his career, Mr. Gore named gun control, saying that ''unlike today, the 1970's did not cry out for restrictions on guns.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After his father's 1970 race, Mr. Gore felt sure he'd never have a career in politics. He talked about writing, even farming -- and told Mr. Hendrick, back at Fort Rucker, that he and Tipper wanted nothing more than to move back to Tennessee, live on a commune and raise vegetables.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Right after Christmas, Specialist 4 Al Gore finally did ship out for Vietnam, and arrived at the 20th Engineer Brigade at Bien Hoa, outside Saigon, on Jan. 2, 1971. The Army was in bad shape at that point, demoralized by the scornful lack of support for a war the country was no longer even trying to win.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''But the one thing you could do'' that didn't seem like an utter waste in those days, Mr. Roche added, was try to build up fellow soldiers by reporting the individual acts of bravery that did happen amid so much despair -- and, less dramatically, the good works of the engineers, who were building roads, hospitals and water purification systems all over the country. And that is what Mr. Gore did in the war.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Bien Hoa was relatively safe, though sirens occasionally warned of mortar attacks. From the quarters Mr. Gore shared with nine other guys, he could hear fighter planes taking off throughout the night.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Barry Ancona, of Manhattan, who had known Mr. Gore at Fort Rucker, said he knew even before Mr. Gore arrived that he was on the ''watch list.'' ''All that meant was that he was connected to someone important. It was more like a protocol thing, but it didn't mean anything.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  An Army photographer, H. Alan Leo, said his commanding officer, Brig. Gen. Kenneth Cooper, called him in before Mr. Gore arrived. ''His exact words were, 'This is not a direct order, but I want to make sure this person does not get into a situation he cannot get out of.' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  General Cooper, now retired, has said he has no memory of either that conversation or Mr. Leo. Several other soldiers who knew both Mr. Gore and Mr. Leo in Vietnam said they liked Mr. Leo but either did not believe him or thought he must have taken a comment like ''Watch his back'' a little too literally.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Leo acknowledged that he had resented Mr. Gore before he ever met him, and changed his routine only slightly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore says he more often traveled with other photographers, and never felt restrained. Did he feel treated differently by some of the other guys, because of his name?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A few men in his company said Mr. Gore was probably best known in Vietnam for his scathing impersonations of superior officers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore also seems to have quoted every Tennessean in Vietnam at one time or another. And he offered highly detailed accounts of the engineers' work.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Every night, he said, the Australians would sing Maori folk songs -- which inspired Mr. Gore to write an admiring story ''about the diversity and multiculturalism'' of their schools. ''I opined that we Yanks could learn a thing or two.'' The piece never ran.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After five months in Vietnam, Mr. Gore applied for and received an early out to attend Vanderbilt divinity school in Nashville. The Army was granting such outs easily at that point.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Vietnam certainly did not make Mr. Gore an anti-interventionist, even in the 1970's and '80's. Unlike others in his party, he supported the invasion of Grenada in 1983 and was one of only 10 Senate Democrats who supported the Gulf War in 1991, infuriating his party's leadership.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Stanisic has no idea. ''In those days you just said, 'Oh, yeah, man, I dig.' '' Mr. Gore said he didn't remember using the word atone, but very much recalled his deeply unsettled feelings about the war. And about coming home.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm not sure I fully understand it,'' Mr. Gore said quietly. ''But you know, it didn't end. You were leaving something that was still going on. If you're a part of something, a war, you want to win it. Not that I had a bayonet in my teeth, but part of what was screwed up about it was that we weren't trying to win.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And if the highly competitive Mr. Gore was atoning, it was not because he went to war, but because he came home.

  As a conscientious opponent of capital punishment, I cannot vote for Vice President Al Gore even though I entirely oppose Gov. George W. Bush. For a great number of us, the choice is between a third-party candidate and not voting. We believe that our duty as citizens is better discharged by sticking to our guns in the face of defeat than by sharing a victory for Mr. Gore's profoundly wrong positions.

  While Al Gore was signing up to fight in (or at least write about) a war that he did not believe in, George W. Bush was somewhat less resolutely partying in Houston.  Mr. Bush, like many young conservatives, had doubts about the war but was nonetheless inclined to support it -- though not necessarily to the point of fighting in it.

  When Mr. Bush graduated from Yale in 1968, he was in roughly the same situation as Mr. Gore was upon graduation from Harvard a year later. Both were Southern men in Ivy League colleges, and both had fathers in Congress who might suffer politically if their sons fled to Canada or took extraordinary measures to avoid the draft.

  Unlike Mr. Gore, who enlisted in the Army, taking a path that he knew would lead to South Vietnam, Mr. Bush signed up to be a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard. It was a coveted posting that significantly reduced any risk that he would be sent to Vietnam, and it probably would not have been obtainable if his father had been less prominent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Did I think about going to the Army post and saying, 'Send me to Vietnam?' '' Mr. Bush asked in an interview. ''Not really. I wanted to fly, and that was the adventure I was seeking.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was always a serious, ambitious young man struggling with deep moral questions and, in the case of Vietnam, with deeply practical calculations about how his actions would play in his father's re-election campaign. Some critics have also suggested that in later years he embellished his Vietnam role for his own political career.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, in contrast, was a carefree, happy-go-lucky fellow who was not disposed to agonize over anything more grand than his Saturday night plans. He was not the kind of person to choose to swelter in the Vietnamese jungle.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a sense, while Mr. Gore might have been more conscientious or responsible, Mr. Bush was far more normal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While the Bush campaign likes to suggest that service in the Guard was an entirely honorable alternative to Vietnam, in 1988 one of Mr. Bush's father's strongest backers (and future chief of staff), John H. Sununu, publicly criticized the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Lloyd Bentsen, for getting his son into the Guard. That was maladroit, since another young man in the same unit as Mr. Bentsen's son was George W. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked if he discussed the war with his father, the younger Mr. Bush says he must have but cannot recall any details. Likewise, roommates and a girlfriend from that period say they do not recall Mr. Bush saying much about the war, and he came across as a lukewarm supporter at a time when most people were passionate one way or the other.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''My first impulse and first inclination was to support the country,'' Mr. Bush recalled in an interview.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000

  Vietnam filtered into the popular consciousness in many ways, but for Mr. Bush and many of his classmates a crucial moment came with the death of George W. Carpenter. Mr. Carpenter, an acquaintance of Mr. Bush and the boyfriend of a cousin, grew up on Long Island and had been valedictorian and class president in high school, as well as captain of the football team.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was a mine that exploded and killed him; he was 20. The death sent a shiver through the Yale campus, and, for classmates like Mr. Bush, Vietnam suddenly seemed more real and dangerous than ever.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''For guys in the Ivy League at that time, there was nobody that I recall very well standing up and saying, 'Hey, my country calls and if these guys from the inner city are going to war, then, by God, so will I,' '' said John T. Sartore, a friend of Mr. Bush at Yale. ''Most people were wandering around figuring out how to get out of it, and there were so many ways: getting married, getting orthotics for your feet, getting braces, failing the medical, joining the Peace Corps and so on.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many of the routes to evade service in Vietnam were out of the question for a man like Mr. Bush, rooted in conservative Texas values. He seems never to have considered pretending to be gay, going to prison for refusing to fight, or fleeing to Canada, and he had his father's political career to worry about.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It was a very hairy time, and I think George had a little different pressure because his father was a public figure,'' said Roland W. Betts, one of Mr. Bush's fraternity brothers at Yale.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As Mr. Bush recalls it, ''There was no question in my mind that there was going to be a military service in 1969.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For Mr. Bush, the crucial step was applying for a position in the Texas Air National Guard while back in Houston for Christmas vacation in his senior year. Nationally, 100,000 people were on waiting lists to get into the Guard, and the details of Mr. Bush's admission to the unit are subject to debate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Critics say that the Bushes pulled rank, but there is no firm proof of this. It is clear, however, that whether or not he demanded it, Mr. Bush got special treatment because he was a Congressman's son.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush not only was admitted to a program with a long waiting list but also was promoted to second lieutenant without going to officer candidate school and jumping through the normal hoops. Likewise, he was given pilot training despite his lack of aviation experience.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush, sensitive to suggestions that he shirked his responsibility in Vietnam, said that during his National Guard service he went to his commander, who is now dead, and asked to be admitted to the Palace Alert program, which could have sent him to Vietnam for a short stint.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In any case, as all the pilots knew, Mr. Bush's plane, the F-102, was virtually obsolete, and so there was little chance that he would be accepted for a mission in Vietnam. And, indeed, he was not.

 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  But Mr. Clinton still made the case, without explicitly naming names, that large tax cuts like those proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas would endanger the longest economic expansion in the nation's history.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Among those in the audience were Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican who has been mentioned as a top vice presidential prospect for Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In an interview, Mr. Ridge said he appreciated the president's ''very conciliatory tone,'' but disagreed vigorously with Mr. Clinton on which economic plan of those proposed by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore was more sound.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''As he was speaking I was thinking of George Bush's 'Prosperity With a Purpose' plan,'' Mr. Ridge said.

  The Teamsters have also written letters on behalf of U.P.S. and with Mr. Gore looking to shore up the support of labor leaders angered by his position on other trade issues, the union could be an important voice. Even American and Delta acknowledge that U.P.S. has built the strongest base.

  ''One hundred and forty years later, that is still true,'' Mr. Bush added. ''For our nation there is no denying the truth that slavery is a blight on our history. And that racism, despite all the progress, still exists today.''

  Mr. Bush, to a large extent, simply retailored his stump speech for the thousands of delegates to the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and he won a polite reception. He did not cover several topics of interest to the delegates, including the death penalty, Supreme Court nominees and affirmative action.
 </textdata>

  Just as Mr. Bush was about to be introduced, four demonstrators rose in the Baltimore Convention Center and began protesting the execution last month of Gary Graham.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Remember Gary Graham,'' the protesters shouted. ''An innocent man was murdered by Governor Bush.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Graham, the 135th inmate to be executed in Texas since Mr. Bush became governor five and a half years ago, went to his death proclaiming his innocence. The N.A.A.C.P. has called his execution a ''gross travesty of justice'' and wants a national moratorium on executions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When he began speaking, Mr. Bush quickly drew laughter by remembering how Jackie Robinson, upset by something John F. Kennedy once did, called the president a fine man but said he reserved the right to change his opinion.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''For those of you who support me,'' Mr. Bush said, ''I see a couple here, maybe more than a couple: I hope you won't change your opinion. And for those of you who don't, I hope that at least you take Jackie's opinion as your own and give me a chance to tell you what is in my heart.''

  Black Americans represent one of the Democratic Party's strongest constituencies, and those Republicans who have appeared before the N.A.A.C.P. have not had an easy time. Mr. Bush's father, who was then the vice president, faced a chorus of boos and hisses in 1983 when he tried to portray the Reagan administration as sensitive to blacks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A year later both Mr. Bush's father and President Reagan cited scheduling conflicts in declining invitations to the convention and sent Elizabeth Dole, then the secretary of transportation. She was received politely but not enthusiastically. Mr. Bush's father did speak to the group as a presidential candidate in 1988.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush's reception today was polite, but he did not appear to have changed many minds. After his speech, a few listeners spoke of his courage in addressing a skeptical crowd. But many more listeners complained about the lack of specifics in the speech.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000

 <textdata>
  Gary Bledsoe, the president of the Texas branch of the civil rights organization, said Mr. Bush, ''reduced some barriers today, but I don't think he won any support.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush spoke of expanding opportunity and said, ''this begins by enforcing the civil rights laws.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Discrimination is still a reality even when it takes different forms,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Instead of Jim Crow, there's racial redlining and profiling. Instead of 'separate but equal,'  there's separate and forgotten. Strong civil rights enforcement will be a cornerstone of my administration.'' He did not elaborate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush put his usual emphasis on education and ending what he called ''the soft bigotry of low expectations'' for minority children. He promoted his plan to give parents in low-income areas vouchers that they could use for private schools if their children attend poor schools that failed to improve.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000

  He has campaigned often in black and Hispanic neighborhoods, to underscore his theme that he is a ''compassionate conservative.'' And his campaign media strategist was on hand today filming the governor's speech, though Mr. Bush's aides said they had no plans, for now, to use the speech in commercials.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush still has significant differences with the N.A.A.C.P., and not just over the death penalty. The group has been leading a boycott of South Carolina over the Confederate battle flag. During the Republican primary in South Carolina, Mr. Bush declined to take a stand on whether the flag should fly over the Capitol.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As a tax-exempt group, the N.A.A.C.P. cannot endorse a presidential candidate. But the evening before Mr. Bush's appearance, the group's leaders urged members to mount an ambitious voter registration drive. Julian Bond, the group's chairman, argued that one more conservative vote on the Supreme Court could result in a setback for civil rights causes.
 </textdata>

  ''One giant chunk of time devoted to counting votes may be gripping if you are a floor clerk in the House or Senate,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the presumptive Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ''But for 249 million other Americans, it's not as captivating.'' Convention officials have told the networks the votes will occur earlier in each evening's program.
 </textdata>

  It is also a gathering, some professional convention watchers said, that will further advance the evolution of the event into a marketing vehicle. Steve Scully, political editor of C-Span, which will provide pool television coverage of the proceedings, said the conventions were traditionally platforms for governors and senators to speak on the issues that concerned them. The plan for prime time outlined by Mr. Card involved speeches by just two elected officials: Mr. Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Others who were given prime time slots include Mr. Bush's wife, Laura; Gen. Colin L. Powell, former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Mr. Bush's adviser on security and foreign policy issues, Condoleezza Rice; and former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole. Mr. Card said that while it is not certain anyone will be designated as the keynote speaker, more people may be added to the speakers' list. The vice-presidential nominee will speak on the convention's third night.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-11-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The slogan for the convention, which begins on July 31, is ''Renewing America's Purpose. Together.'' Mr. Card said there will be a specific theme on each of the evenings: education and health care on Monday, military strength on Tuesday and prosperity and protecting Social Security on Wednesday. Thursday will be devoted to Mr. Bush, who will deliver his acceptance speech.

  Ah, July. The children commune with Harry Potter while their parents watch the ''Big Brother'' roommates try to make an alarm clock out of a couple of potatoes. (Where's Al Gore when you need a consult?) Just outside our nation's capital, kids of all ages have been flocking to an arcade in Rockville, Md., to ride on The Shocker, an electric chair simulation that challenges patrons to hang on until smoke comes out of their skulls.

  July is a special month in American politics, a semiofficial civic vacation from the yearlong presidential campaign. Admittedly, most Americans have already been on hiatus from this race for so long they've forgotten the names of the candidates. (Is Gary Bauer in this somewhere? What ever happened to Orrin Hatch?) But that was a springtime form of inattention. We overlooked George W. Bush and Al Gore absent-mindedly, the way we neglected to catch ''Mission Impossible 2.'' In July you can ignore politics in a decisive, activist way, the way we did ''The Patriot.''

Just outside our nation's capital, kids of all ages have been flocking to an arcade in Rockville, Md., to ride on The Shocker, an electric chair simulation that challenges patrons to hang on until smoke comes out of their skulls. (Where's George W. Bush when you need a photo op?)

  July is a special month in American politics, a semiofficial civic vacation from the yearlong presidential campaign. Admittedly, most Americans have already been on hiatus from this race for so long they've forgotten the names of the candidates. (Is Gary Bauer in this somewhere? What ever happened to Orrin Hatch?) But that was a springtime form of inattention. We overlooked George W. Bush and Al Gore absent-mindedly, the way we neglected to catch ''Mission Impossible 2.'' In July you can ignore politics in a decisive, activist way, the way we did ''The Patriot.''

  But that's an August problem -- August looks like summer, but it's really autumn with high temperatures, full of back-to-school sales and professional football. July, on the other hand, is a month that imposes so few demands that it will be happy if it just succeeds in eliminating a few more people from the ''Survivor''  island. Three weeks from now, Sean-the-neurologist-with-nipple-ring and  Susan-the-tough-talking-truck-driver will no longer be part of the ongoing national dialogue, and July can declare victory. Unless, of course, Al Gore picks one of them as his running mate.

  Current conventional wisdom holds that Mr. Gore's choice of a vice-presidential nominee will be greatly influenced by Mr. Bush, who goes first at the Republican Convention in Philadelphia. Mr. Bush is said to be looking for someone boring, the better to avoid a moment like the one in 1988 when the words ''Dan Quayle'' created a Mardi-Gras-like sense of anticipation in the press room at the Republican Convention.
 </textdata>

  If Mr. Bush selects Gov. George Pataki of New York, who was his classmate at Yale, Mr. Gore might pick Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, a fellow alumnus of St. Albans in Washington D.C. Both slates could embark on the ceremonial post-convention bus tour wearing their school jackets, waving pom-poms out the window.

 <textdata>
  However, the Republican Party ought to consider giving the nod to Mr. Giuliani, who is currently operating under a misalignment of the stars so powerful that he might serve as a kind of a magnet, drawing political misfortune away from the guy at the top. If that happened, Mr. Gore would undoubtedly want to hunt up a bigger, more powerful bad luck magnet of his own -- say, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.

  It was a sedate cocktail party on a summer evening in Kennebunkport, Me., when the wild man of the Bush clan wobbled up to an old friend of his parents, a prim, well-dressed matron who had recently turned 50, her hair pulled tightly back from her forehead in the most severe way.

 <textdata>
  It was a vintage Bush moment, recounted by friends, the kind of incident that made young George's buddies laugh and cringe at the same time. He could be hilarious company, but also often outrageous and childish. Some acquaintances were offended by what they saw as Mr. Bush's arrogance and immaturity, by his penchant for drinking too much and thinking too little. Even his wife, Laura, wanted him to grow up.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Not everyone is that harsh, and many of his friends welcomed the ''bombastic Bushkin,'' as they called him, as a breath of fresh air. But the upshot was that as he approached 40, an age when Al Gore was already a senator running for president, George W. Bush was just a heavy-drinking, fun-loving oilman struggling to control his temper, salvage his business and hold on to his marriage.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Then Mr. Bush did grow up. A classic late bloomer, Mr. Bush offers reassurance for 40-year-olds everywhere. Just 14 years later, he is a multimillionaire, a successful businessman who turned around the Texas Rangers and prospered with them; the overwhelmingly popular governor of Texas, the only one to be elected to a second consecutive four-year term; the about-to-be-crowned Republican nominee for president, running ahead in the polls; and, apparently most important of all in his own priorities, the very happily married husband of Laura.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush redeemed himself and is today very much a product of that redemption. On the campaign trail, it lends him an air of authenticity, allowing him to come across as a decent man today without the baggage of having always been a squeaky-clean, apple-polishing mama's boy.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There is a popular image of Mr. Bush's younger days, fueled by late-night television jokes, suggesting that he spent much of the 1970's stupefied in a drug-fueled haze. But Mr. Bush's elliptical comments suggesting that he used drugs before 1974 may have led people to think that he was wilder than he really was, and the fuller portrait of him in the 1970's and early 1980's indicates that his behavior was more callow than criminal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's problem, it seems, was not so much that he was dissolute as that he was irresolute. He continued plodding along, acting young and irresponsible when he was well into middle age, until he faced a personal crisis.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A common criticism of Mr. Bush is that he has enjoyed a charmed life, without ever having to struggle, and there is something to the idea that he has been incredibly lucky and privileged at many junctures. But the truth is also more complex, and on his own terms life in the 1970's and 80's was no stroll through a sun-dappled park.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  With oil prices plunging, Mr. Bush struggled to keep his business going. He was deeply pained that he had lost money that friends had invested with him. And most cutting of all, some friends say, he worried that his wife was so sick of his boorish behavior that she would consider leaving him and taking their twin daughters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  These pressures, instead of breaking Mr. Bush, changed him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But one of the keys to his turnaround seems to have been his succession of failures in politics and business, which acquaintances said humbled him and left him much more likable. Another was pressure from Mrs. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So Mr. Bush gave up alcohol and turned toward religion. He remade himself, and then his tremendous people skills, backed by his family connections, took over and propelled him in both business and politics.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  What makes George Bush tick?
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The younger George Bush is more complicated, and for him the answer reflects one of the critical differences between him and his father: George W. is fiercely competitive, but for most of his life he was not ferociously ambitious. That combination helps explain both the stuttering first two-thirds of his life and the triumphant latest third.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Normally, competitive people are also ambitious. But Mr. Bush has been an anomaly, for from childhood he was always enormously competitive in certain areas -- playing baseball, winning friends, making people laugh, giving great parties -- without being particularly focused on the future.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Friends say that if there is one overriding reason that Mr. Bush gravitated toward politics it is not so much overweening ambition as a series of personal encounters with successful politicians; after rubbing shoulders with them, he concluded: I can do better than these bozos!
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Looking at the careers of President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore, one gets the sense of a man running a marathon, resolutely pushing on with thoughts of glory at the finish tape. Mr. Bush's career, in contrast, brings to mind a cheerful hitchhiker who has the incredible good fortune to be picked up by a series of limousines.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I don't know whether I'll be your president,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview, adding: ''But you know, I've got the sense of, if it's meant to be, fine. And if it's not meant to be, you know, heck, it's not something I planned my life to be anyway.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was only when Mr. Bush arrived at Harvard Business School in the fall of 1973 that he began to buckle down and prepare more rigorously for the future.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After graduation in 1975, Mr. Bush still did not know what he wanted to do with his life. He spent the summer in China, where his father had taken a job as chief United States envoy, and this was an occasion when his unfamiliarity with foreign policy had practical consequences.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush had hoped to date Chinese women, but as any student of international relations could have told him, Chairman Mao was still ruling China, the Cultural Revolution was under way and China's women were unwilling to give up their Little Red Books to engage in counterrevolutionary entanglements with visiting Americans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Eventually Mr. Bush took up a family friend's invitation to return to Midland, Tex., where he had spent his childhood. He decided to start in the oil business just as his father had.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It smelled right and it felt right,'' Mr. Bush recalled, adding, ''I really wanted to be my own man, my own businessman.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By all accounts, Mr. Bush worked hard to build up his oil business and, in 1978, to run for Congress in an unsuccessful campaign. He married Laura and stopped bringing his laundry over for his friends' wives to wash.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet while there is something to that, Mr. Bush also seems to have retained a good bit of immaturity even as he forged ahead in the business world. Young people often found him charming, fun and exciting to be around, as well as tremendously friendly and likable. But others sometimes saw him as arrogant and childish.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''My impression at that time was that he was a little immature,'' recalled Curtis Webster, a local banker and city councilman. Mr. Webster remembered a time when he and a friend met Mr. Bush on the street, and Mr. Bush play-punched the friend on the arm.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On another occasion, Mr. Bush barged in late at a Republican reception at the Midland Hilton. He greeted everybody with a bit too much ebullience (''Hey, here I am, did anyone miss me?'') and then came up behind a dignitary in midconversation, tapping him on the far shoulder so the man turned to find nobody at all.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some of Mr. Bush's friends tittered, but others present saw it as confirmation that Mr. Bush had a few rough edges.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The election defeat in 1978 was a major blow to Mr. Bush and his friends, but many people in the area thought it was the best thing for his personality.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I've heard a lot of people say that the experience changed him, made him more humble,'' said Johnnye Davis, a local Republican activist who raves about Mr. Bush but also recalls a ''cocky side'' that turned some people off.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That cockiness seemed to retreat as Mr. Bush faced difficulties in the business world and struggled through a business downturn.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a sense, Mr. Bush's strength lay in salesmanship. Then as now, he was a brilliant fund-raiser, and through his family and father's friends raised millions of dollars to drill for oil. But he never found much petroleum, and then in the mid-1980's oil prices virtually collapsed, so that his investors -- like many others -- did poorly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  According to a company prospectus, Mr. Bush raised $4.67 million from his limited partners, but his company returned only $1.55 million in distributions (plus hefty tax write-offs). Meanwhile, Mr. Bush structured the deals so that he did pretty well for himself even as his investors suffered.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was not a bad arrangement for himself, and Mr. Bush's longtime friend and accountant, Robert A. McCleskey, says that Mr. Bush's net worth rose from $50,000 in 1975 to more than $1 million by 1988. That is not, Mr. McCleskey notes, the record of a man who is a failure in business.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, it was humiliating. Investors had lost money, and everybody knew that Mr. Bush had essentially failed in creating a viable company.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He became a much more likable person in a few years after he got here,'' Mr. Angelo said of Mr. Bush. ''He had the reputation when he came here of being cocky and arrogant, and he lived that down.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By all accounts, a crucial factor in the taming of George W. Bush was his marriage in 1977. As a friend from Yale days, Donald B. Ensenat, says, ''Laura changed him.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Laura Bush comes across as quiet and meek, and because she started off as a school librarian Mr. Bush used to tease that her idea of a speech was saying, ''Shhhhhh.'' But friends say that she can be a tough woman who deflates her husband when she feels it is necessary.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When others laughed at his raucous style and impishness, it was Mrs. Bush who told him to pipe down. When others offered him another beer, Mrs. Bush told him to cool it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''She holds his feet to the fire,'' said Mike Barker, a West Texas journalist who has known Mr. Bush since before he was married. ''My impression is that privately she tells him exactly what she thinks.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mutual friends say that Mrs. Bush was attracted to her husband's impishness and boisterousness but also, over time, wearied of it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Laura gets a lot of credit'' for calming her husband, mused Elsie Walker, Mr. Bush's cousin. ''She loves George's fun side, but after a while she got tired of George's edges that came from the drinking.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Bush increasingly began to lean on her husband to quit drinking, friends say. Mr. Bush says he does not know if he was actually an alcoholic, but acknowledges that he was drinking too much, and others share that assessment. He was not a mean drunk, but when lubricated he could be loud, obnoxious and hardly the kind of father a mother wanted around her young daughters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has told several friends over the years that he was forced to choose.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Laura said, 'It's me or the bottle,' '' one longtime friend quoted Mr. Bush as saying. ''She said it to me maybe 50 times.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has contested the idea that the marriage was ever so severely strained, and some friends say they saw no signs of strain beyond typical marital spats. One confidant believes that Mrs. Bush may never have quite given an ultimatum but that Mr. Bush told friends she had because he felt in his mind that he had to choose -- that unless he gave up liquor he would lose his daughters, whom he treasured above all.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In any case, even those who say that the marriage was seriously troubled say that Mr. Bush always appeared to be faithful to his wife and shunned opportunities for flings when they came along, as they sometimes did. He could be indiscreet about his love life before marriage, friends say, but always insisted that he had been true to Laura.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Then in the summer of 1985 Mr. Bush met with Billy Graham -- a meeting engineered by his parents -- at the family compound in Kennebunkport. They had lunch on the patio overlooking the ocean, dinner by the fire and long conversations as they strolled along the shore. Mr. Bush was inspired to begin reading the Bible daily (which he says he still does), and back in Midland he began attending a Bible study class.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush had grown up in a religious household, attending First Presbyterian Church in Midland, but it was an austere, restrained Yankee faith. After his daughters were born, he switched to his wife's church, First United Methodist, but a close friend says that in those days he went to church each Sunday more for the sake of his daughters than because of any deep inner commitment.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet after the meeting with Mr. Graham and his Bible study sessions, Mr. Bush became increasingly serious about his religion. He is at home discussing religious matters with evangelical leaders in a way his father never was. Mr. Bush is publicly guarded about his beliefs (partly because of a much cited incident in which he suggested that non-Christians could not get to heaven), but by all accounts, his faith has developed into something that is an important part of his inner life and that was a significant element in his maturing.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In July 1986, a year after he began studying the Bible seriously, George and Laura Bush went with a half-dozen friends to celebrate their collective 40th birthdays at the luxurious Broadmoor resort in Colorado. There was one evening when they all stayed up late, drinking a bit too merrily.
 </textdata>
 <date>
     7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The next morning, Mr. Bush has recalled, he woke up feeling befuddled -- and quietly resolved that he would never touch alcohol again. Friends say he told nobody, not even his wife, until weeks after their return to Midland. He simply drank sodas instead of beers, and it was many weeks later that he finally explained to his friends that he had given up liquor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush worked harder and mellowed a bit, so that while he remained mischievous he was less likely to offend. He became a better father. He grew up.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While he has buckled down in recent years, Mr. Bush even now on the campaign trail comes across as unusually relaxed or complacent, depending on one's point of view. He often takes Sundays off, he reserves time for jogging or working out, and in contrast to Mr. Gore he gives the impression that he still would rather spend an evening joking with friends than reading a health-care policy analysis.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Somebody said, 'Well, what are you going to do after you're governor?' '' Mr. Bush mused. ''Or, 'If you don't win president, what are you going to do?' I mean, I just don't worry about those things. I kind of figure life is going to work its way out somehow.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Nothing could be more antithetical to the way George W. Bush has lived his life. He is a cheery guy whose success has arisen not from self-doubt but from self-confidence, and when setbacks have arisen he has normally shrugged and moved on.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Deep disappointment washed over Mr. Bush, for example, one April afternoon when he was a junior at Yale. He fervently wanted to follow his father and grandfather into Skull and Bones, the most exclusive of Yale's secret societies, but word trickled out on ''tap day'' that he would not be among those invited for membership.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush was understandably subdued as he ran into a fraternity brother, Robert A. F. Reisner, near the Yale Co-op bookstore. Mr. Bush explained that he was deeply disappointed by failing to keep up the tradition. But he added that he was ready to move on.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush need not have been so stoical. Luck stood by him, as it usually has, and that night he was tapped into Skull and Bones after all.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has also held on to a bit of his bombastic style and needling humor. When his father was president and invited Queen Elizabeth to the White House for a state banquet in May 1991, his mother introduced him to the queen -- and he promptly began telling a yarn about how he had embroidered his new cowboy boots with the phrase ''God Save the Queen.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Bush explained tartly to Queen Elizabeth that she had seated George well away from Her Majesty, ''for fear of him saying something.'' Then, the Bushes have recounted, George confessed to the queen that he was his family's black sheep and added, to his mother's horror, ''Who's yours?''

  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, on his way here for a triumphal nomination, ended the last bit of uncertainty surrounding next week's convention by killing efforts to allow voters in all states to cast primary ballots that actually counted.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On May 12, Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, told reporters that Mr. Bush had no position then on the plan and would have none later. But this morning Mr. Rove passed the word to members of the convention rules committee that the campaign wanted it killed, and the committee duly voted to kill it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's intervention on the primary proposal bluntly brushed aside several months' work of party leaders, like the Republican chairman, Jim Nicholson, to design a new system, and there was a bit of mystery today surrounding the Bush camp's reasons. The people Mr. Rove talked to either declined to quote his stated reasons or dismissed them as implausible. Most members put the last-minute move down to a desire to have a convention utterly free of conflict, even if the fight would take place hours before prime time.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One high-level Bush aide said the campaign feared its re-election efforts would be hindered if a new calendar led states to shift from primaries to caucuses and state conventions in 2004. Some rules committee members said Democrats would keep states like California and New York from changing the dates of primaries, forcing Republicans in those states to use caucuses. The aide called caucuses a ''breeding ground'' for trouble. Republican caucuses often fall under control of the party's most right-wing elements.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Karl did express some concern to several members of the rules committee, saying we were concerned this would put the Republicans at a competitive disadvantage,'' said Karen P. Hughes, a Bush spokeswoman. She said the Bush campaign also had concerns ''that it would limit the number of candidates who are able to participate in so many places all at once.''

  Morton Blackwell, a committee member from Virginia, said one virtue of the Republican Party was that its rules were ''locked in concrete'' from one convention to the next. He said if the national committee was given this authority, which the Democratic National Committee already has, ''we could have heaven knows what imposed on us from the top.'' That vote was 72 to 28, even though the Bush campaign took no stand on it.

  One indication of the utter control displayed by the Bush campaign over the plan to string out the primaries was the unwillingness of the losers even to complain about it during the meeting. Indeed, the Bush position was never mentioned, except when Tom Sansonetti of Wyoming, the chairman of the rules committee, told the meeting that the Bush campaign had no position. That was minutes before Mr. Rove told him things had changed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Sansonetti said in an interview that Mr. Rove had told him the Bush campaign thought the plan was flawed because candidates would have to undergo heavy, tiring travel in February, when a dozen very small states would vote.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That objection, also cited today on the Bush campaign plane by a spokesman, Scott McClellan, had never been raised in any meeting on the plan, where the early, small-state campaigning was specifically designed to keep any candidate from dominating all the early states, and thereby to give underfinanced hopefuls a chance to make an impression by an early victory.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  David Norcross, a rules committee member from New Jersey who had been among the plan's most enthusiastic supporters until this week, said the Bush campaign had raised the travel question with him, too, along with the problem that some states might face if Democrats blocked any change.

  He said no one from the Bush camp had mentioned a desire to avoid a floor fight to him. The closest anyone came to admitting that motive was when Ms. Hughes, the Bush spokeswoman, said, ''Obviously we want our convention to focus primarily on Governor Bush and his positive proposal for America, but we wanted people to be heard in the process.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  But Tom Rath, a committee member from New Hampshire, disagreed. He said, ''The race ends politically a lot earlier than it ends mathematically.'' He said that although Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore were seen as certain winners after the March 7 primaries, they did not yet have the delegates needed for nomination. Those majorities were reached on March 14.

  To understand why the conventions are the way they are, and why the G.O.P. chose Philly, we might think of the conventions as a movie. The Democrats' movie is lush: Al Gore and Bill Clinton soar into town on Air Force One and Two and sweep into the homes of Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg in long processions of limousines, and then the crown passes from Mr. Clinton to Mr. Gore in downtown's Staples Center while klieg lights illuminate the liquid Southern California sky. It's a pleasant image, and it's O.K. for a TV movie of the week. But where is the drama? Where is the ''arc,'' as we say? Mr. Gore goes from a mansion on Observatory Circle off Massachusetts Avenue to mansions in Malibu? That's no arc.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To make it better, we throw in a generous slice of ''Rocky,'' the ultimate movie of Philadelphia and the redemption of the underdog. After Dubya and Dick Cheney have frightened off the first group of attackers, they think they are safe, and start to unwind with some Tex-Mex food and beer. But when they leave the tavern, they're quickly surrounded by Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader and a howling mob of environmental protectionist agitators. Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney have to battle against unheard-of odds to get through (think of Richard Nixon besieged in Caracas in 1958 or maybe of those little children lost in the forest in ''Hansel and Gretel'') to make it back to the convention, which has been moved to the front of the Philadelphia Art Museum.

  They break free of the pursuers, and then, to the soaring music of ''The Whiffenpoof Song,'' dance around and shadow-box before they go inside to the exultation of the masses of delegates. As an exhausted but defiant Governor Bush takes the stage, he turns his head and bellows, ''Noooo inheritance tax. . .'' and the G.O.P. goes wild. (It even sounds a little like ''Yo, Adrian. . .'')

  CLINTON CRITICIZES BUSH  As hundreds of Democrats feasted on lobster and clams yesterday at a fund-raiser  for Representative Patrick J. Kennedy in Barrington, R.I., President Clinton served up some partisan zingers.  Mr. Clinton mocked Gov. George W. Bush for his gee-whiz attitude toward the presidency. ''I've been governor of Texas. My daddy was president. I own a baseball team. They like me down there,'' Mr. Clinton said, imitating Mr. Bush. ''Everything is rocking along hunky-dory. Their fraternity had it for eight years. Give it to ours for eight years.'' The president said the Republicans were trying to blur the serious policy differences, especially over how to handle the budget surplus, between Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. ''That's the message, isn't it? Blur, blur, blur,'' he said. The president helped Mr. Kennedy raise $450,000 for his Congressional campaign and then flew to Boston, where two events last night collected $950,000 for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

  POLLS GIVE BUSH A WIDER LEAD  Vice President Al Gore had appeared to be steadily chipping away at Gov. George W. Bush's lead in the polls, and in several had almost pulled even. But since Tuesday, when Mr. Bush picked Dick Cheney to be his running mate, the Texas governor has reopened the gap to double digits, two polls indicated. A Time magazine poll released yesterday found that Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by 16 percentage points, 52 percent to 36 percent. Ralph Nader of the Green Party had 5 percent, and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party 4 percent. A CNN-USA Today Gallup Poll on Thursday had Mr. Bush ahead of Mr. Gore by 11 points, 50 percent to 39 percent. Mr. Nader had 4 percent and Mr. Buchanan 1 percent. Both polls had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

  In the district where a young Bill Clinton lost a race for Congress at the age of 28, Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, were greeted by a roaring crowd packed into a high school auditorium and chanting a football fight cheer. Dozens of children were arrayed on the stage behind them and a banner proclaimed, ''Renewing America's Purpose.''

  Mr. Bush pointed to two local boys-made-good -- Senator Tim Hutchinson and his brother, Asa, the congressman who gained renown as one of the impeachment managers who prosecuted Mr. Clinton.
 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''They whispered something in my ear that made Dick Cheney and I feel really great,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They told us we're going to carry Arkansas next fall. They told us not to worry about the last two election cycles. Something else is taking place in this state.''

  Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney took turns taking shots at the integrity and trustworthiness of the president, who was impeached, but later acquitted for his efforts to cover up his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. Neither man mentioned impeachment directly or even Mr. Clinton's name, but again and again they harked back to the Lewinsky scandal.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cheney said he and his running mate were ''on a great crusade to restore dignity and integrity to Washington.'' And as the crowd cheered he called Mr. Bush ''the man who is going to give our kids and our grandkids a government we once again can be proud of.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush praised Mr. Cheney in turn, and in the process took a shot at Mr. Clinton for his effort to sidestep questions about Ms. Lewinsky. ''This man is a good man,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Cheney. ''He's a solid man. He's a man who understands what the definition of is is.''

  As he began his swing into the Republican convention, Mr. Bush had some good news -- two new polls showing him in the lead. Even in Arkansas, a Mason-Dixon poll just last week showed Mr. Bush leading Vice President Al Gore, 46 to 40 percent. It had a four-point margin of error.

  The Democrats kept up their assault on Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney as the ''big oil dream ticket,'' and circulated a Reuters report from 1999 saying that Mr. Cheney, the chief executive of the Halliburton Company, a worldwide oil services firm, had praised an OPEC decision to cut oil production.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's spokeswoman, said that Mr. Cheney had been speaking at a conference of industry analysts and telling them of projections by economists that OPEC would cut production and that the ''price situation'' for the industry would improve.
 </textdata>

  ''I'm really looking forward to this speech,'' Mr. Bush said. ''This is going to be an unbelievably interesting moment in my life -- to walk out on that stage and to speak from my heart for however long it takes to get through the speech.''

  Even today on what was supposed to be a partisan tour, Mr. Bush tried to soften the tone. Before his rally he toured the Jones Center for Families, a community center founded by a family that ran one of the nation's largest trucking businesses.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000

 <textdata>
  ''We're here to hear and see and feel first hand the acts of this particular platoon in the armies of compassion,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As he took a quick tour of the center's computer operation, one of the first people to greet him was Charles A. Huffer, who tightly gripped the governor's hand and began speaking. Mr. Bush looked bewildered and brushed him off quickly.

  From the Democratic National Committee, the people who came up with the chicken that chased President George Bush in 1992 and the cigarette that dogged Bob Dole in 1996, comes the party's newest tool of disruption: the Texas Truth Squad, 14 elected officials and citizens bearing tales of George Bush-induced woe from the Lone Star State.

  They have traveled through Kentucky and Ohio on their way to West Virginia and Philadelphia, where the Republican National Convention will begin on Monday.

  At the heart of it all, teams of researchers at the national committee's offices in Washington and the Gore 2000 headquarters in Nashville will issue floods of faxes and e-mail messages in a minute-by-minute effort to rebut virtually everything every Republican says from the convention stage in Philadelphia.

  Led by David Ginsberg, a pot-bellied, chain-smoking, bearded, balding and brainy 25-year-old, the Gore researchers were often stunningly successful in undermining the daily messages of Bill Bradley during the Democratic primaries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In Iowa, they inundated reporters with information about a vote Mr. Bradley cast against flood relief for farmers, and the issue dogged Mr. Bradley for days. Later, when Mr. Bradley attacked Mr. Gore for supporting the tobacco industry two decades ago, Mr. Ginsberg was ready with a compilation of quotes from Mr. Bradley vowing to avoid negative campaigning.
 </textdata>

  7-29-2000

 <textdata>
  More recently, the Gore team's researchers pulled repeated all-nighters compiling thick dossiers on every potential Republican vice-presidential candidate. The one man they failed to study closely was the one who was chosen. But as soon as Mr. Cheney's name emerged last weekend, they went into overdrive. And the moment Mr. Bush made his choice official on Tuesday morning, Mr. Ginsberg had already distributed a detailed analysis of Mr. Cheney's voting record in Congress, which was so conservative that it surprised even some Republicans.

  Today's vote was not surprising; Mr. Bush and Republican leaders had indicated early on that they wanted no changes in the abortion plank, which called for a ban on abortion without exception, and the appointment of judges who respected ''the sanctity of innocent human life.'' They were keenly aware that four years ago, the party's nominee, former Senator Bob Dole, sought to add a ''tolerance'' clause, only to suffer an embarrassing defeat at the hands of the anti-abortion forces.
 </textdata>

  The day's deliberations reflected a party acutely aware of Mr. Bush's political needs, and his efforts to appeal to swing voters on issues like education, but also unwilling, at times, to compromise on core beliefs.  Some of the biggest fights, for example, came on the platform's section on education, with conservatives resisting a strong federal role on what they argued should be a matter for state and local communities and families.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The 1996 platform, for example, called for the abolition of the Department of Education; the draft developed by party leaders and the Bush forces did not. But conservatives amended that draft in subcommittee today to say that the role of the federal government in education ''must be progressively limited,'' and were clearly resistant to much of the detailed education agenda put forward by the Texas governor.

Especially if you're posing in ''inclusive'' photo ops worthy of a Benetton campaign.

  The non-ideological swing voters likely to decide this election take one look at Mr. Cheney, or catch one monotonous sound bite, then promptly trance out and forget what the Democrats are barking about. Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne, once wrote a novel about a vice president whose death was kept secret, and while this scenario may not be literally true in the case of her husband, it is metaphorically so. The mild, round, expressionless Mr. Cheney is like a deadening cushion that will soften, absorb or deflect any rhetorical weapons that Al Gore might hurl at him -- much as Mr. Bush's mastery of don't-worry-be-happy theatrics has ever since his campaign made its sole major slip-up to date, the detour to Bob Jones. The Texas governor has even managed to play down his role as the country's Lord High Executioner by suppressing the smirk and invoking the deity once Gary Graham was dead.

  Democrats, frustrated by both Mr. Bush's affable image and the small target offered by his slim resume in public life, claim to be ecstatic about gaining Mr. Cheney as a fatter target. If so, they are delusional -- or at least hopelessly out of touch with the culture in which this campaign is unfolding. In a time of what Jesse Jackson has aptly named ''prosperity fatigue,'' more Americans care about who is going to be voted off the island on ''Survivor'' or who will succeed Kathie Lee Gifford on the Regis morning ticket than who will be the next vice president. After ''Survivor,'' just in time for the debates, come the Olympics, another distraction from what is already proving a stealth election year. This month 43 percent of Americans told pollsters they wouldn't watch the G.O.P. convention -- a rise from 23 percent in '96. A Pew survey shows that the number of those thinking ''quite a lot'' about the election is also down steeply from the same summer juncture of both '96 and '92. ''Even most registered Republicans'' are unaware that their party's convention is looming, according to Harvard's Vanishing Voter survey.

  This is a boon to the Bush campaign. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, it was a plus, not a minus, when the Cheney announcement was knocked off the evening news lead by the Concorde crash and the collapse of the Mideast peace talks. A few seconds of Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney in a warming Prince-Hal-and-Falstaff pose served to convey the campaign's desired message, with no time left for dissonant interference. The same goes for the convention next week. Programmed to be as soothing as a Claritin commercial -- even Clinton-bashing is on mute -- the G.O.P. spectacular in Philadelphia will defy in-depth network coverage. If channel surfers glimpse a snapshot of the inclusiveness, that's good enough. And that's all most of them will get: such is the state of convention coverage that tomorrow Tom Brokaw headlines a panel at Philadelphia City Hall titled ''Is There a Future for on-the-Air Televised Conventions?'' that (at two hours) is itself scheduled to run longer than the slots the big three broadcast networks have allotted to the convention in prime time most nights.

  Neither is the traditional civil war over abortion likely to disturb the peace. The religious right can gloat this year, not thunder, since Mr. Cheney is actually to the right of Mr. Bush on the issue -- no easy feat. As for that small band of potentially noisy pro-choice Republican leaders, most I've spoken to this week are ready to declare a truce for a mere pat on the head -- a couple of sentences professing tolerance for their views in a platform that continues to call for the outlawing of all abortions. They aren't getting even that, but don't expect any drama. Hardly had the Cheney announcement dashed pipe dreams of a Tom Ridge or George Pataki than some pro-choicers began retreating to the line that Mr. Bush is O.K. because he has promised not to make a pro-life stance a ''litmus test'' for Supreme Court nominees. That's a flimsy straw to cling to, given that the governor's favorite sitting justices are the vehemently anti-choice Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia and that his appointee as the top health official in Texas, Dr. William Archer, is not only anti-choice but against giving teenagers birth-control information that might prevent unwanted pregnancies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-29-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But as Susan Cullman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition points out, the Bush campaign is betting that its disciplined focus on education uber alles and equally disciplined silence about abortion will neutralize his anti-choice stance to busy suburban voters. And she may be right. A single photo op with a few hand-picked homosexuals papered over Mr. Bush's career-long failure to speak up for civil rights for gay people. Should anyone bring up his non-compassionate record on AIDS -- in fact a nonexistent record in his first five years as governor of a state with the fourth-highest caseload -- a hospital visit could turn the tide.

  To learn the genesis of this campaign technique, look not to old Reagan-Bush strategies but to Dana Milbank's recent Washington Post account of Mr. Bush's stint as owner of the Texas Rangers. The salesmanship used to boost that struggling baseball franchise seems a blueprint for the campaign. To ensure favorable press coverage, Mr. Bush flattered reporters and gave them ''a great press box.'' Though catering to the rich by adding a profusion of luxury boxes to his new stadium, he hired an architect to camouflage the class distinctions from the hoi polloi. ''I'm not so sure you can segue from baseball to a presidency,'' Mr. Bush said modestly to Mr. Milbank, ''but there are some lessons about management, about developing a strategy. Baseball is a marketing business.''

  Al Gore is in the marketing business too, but his frenetic style and frequent changes of costume are all wrong for this easy-listening time. He's a manic stickler for details going up against a calm stickler for generalities. The vice president's best hope may be that Mr. Bush is as complacent as the sure victor the G.O.P. nominated in Philadelphia 52 years ago, Thomas Dewey. But Mr. Gore is no Harry Truman. Plain speaking is not, shall we say, his forte, and his attack rhetoric merely plays into the Republicans' hands by paradoxically making him, not Mr. Bush or Mr. Cheney, seem more like a slashing politician of the despised Gingrich era in Washington. Expressing his frustration with the Bush campaign's success in theatrics while on the stump this week, Mr. Gore told the crowd, ''You and I know this is not about show business.''

  New Primary System Is Quashed by Bush Camp  Gov. George W. Bush ended the last bit of uncertainty surrounding the Republican convention next week by killing an effort to allow voters in all states to cast primary ballots that actually counted. The Republican National Committee's plan was intended to lengthen the primary system by making the big states vote last. Members of the committee attributed the Bush camp's opposition to the plan to a desire to have a convention free of conflict.

With his stop in the rolling green farm country in the northwest corner of Arkansas, Mr. Bush began a five-day march to the Republican National Convention that will take him through the battleground states of Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

  Mr. Johnson's efforts to bend television news to his will clearly fascinated Mr. Gore.

Mr. Sigel is eager to find new ways of producing, or presenting, new or old material for new audiences. ''We want to interest other producers in coming here. The blockbuster type show is on the way out, and more theaters'' -- he mentioned Goodspeed in East Haddam and the Bushnell in Hartford -- are planning smaller stages. ''There is a paucity of product to command a large stage,'' he added, looking to alliances with regional theaters and expressing interest in extending the life of Off Broadway plays and musicals.

  Mr. Sharpton was hardly alone, of course, in suggesting that the photograph was so problematic that it could cost Mrs. Whitman a spot on the Republican presidential ticket with Gov. George W.

  Today, by contrast, with her party's convention coming to New Jersey's backyard in two weeks, Mrs. Whitman's horizons are generally seen as limited to a cabinet office at best, or even to an ambassadorship, if Mr. Bush wins in November. ''By and large most people are acknowledging that the vice presidency isn't ready to be served up to her,'' said Tom Wilson, a former director of the state Republican Party.

  This campaign for the Senate started almost as soon as the last one ended, in November 1998, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced that he would not seek re-election. Mrs. Clinton has been talking and listening her way across New York since last July. Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have been making daily policy pronouncements and attacks from the moment each emerged as his party's presumptive presidential nominee in March. The United States Senate race in New Jersey, one of that state's most combative and closely watched campaigns in decades, has thrown a few more voices into the political din, at least in the New York metropolitan region.

  It doesn't help that there are only so many issues to go around, and it does seem as if Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Gore, Mr. Lazio and Mr. Bush are reading off the findings of the same focus groups.

  In Texas, officials did not merely delay implementation of the enhanced inspection program in 1995, they scrapped it entirely as it was set to begin. Critics called it a short-term concession to convenience that turned out to have a significant cost to the environment and to taxpayers. When Texas legislators and the governor, George W. Bush, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, repealed the law that included the enhanced inspections, they reneged on a contract that had already been signed with a company called Tejas Testing Technology. Tejas has since gone bankrupt, but only after suing the state and receiving a settlement of $140 million, most of which was paid from a state environmental cleanup fund.

  Last week, President Clinton and both major presidential candidates, George W. Bush and Al Gore, made pilgrimages to the N.A.A.C.P.'s annual meeting. Their appearances were a reminder that this country's next leap forward in race relations must build upon but also reach beyond the issues that moved America in the 1960's, when bigotry was more nakedly expressed and civil rights advocates of both races could focus their united energies on the legal barriers to political and educational equality.

  At a time when polls show Vice President Al Gore trailing his Republican rival, Gov. George W.

  ''I think Bill Clinton could carry this state for Al Gore,'' said Jim Edmunson, the chairman of the Oregon Democratic Party, a traditionally strong Democratic state where a recent poll shows Mr. Gore trailing Mr. Bush of Texas. ''My counsel would be to use the president wherever and as often as they can.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the pressure to use Mr. Clinton has placed the Gore campaign in a bind. The vice president's advisers acknowledge that Mr. Clinton's artful touch with a crowd could energize Democratic voters for Mr. Gore. But they worry that the president will outshine Mr. Gore on the trail, making the nominee seem more like the campaign's understudy than its star.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For that very reason, the Democrats have scheduled Mr. Clinton to address the Democratic National Convention on its first evening next month, thereby leaving the spotlight to Mr. Gore for the next three nights. Most Democrats view the convention as the moment when Mr. Gore must step decisively out of Mr. Clinton's shadow and stake his claim as the party's undisputed chief.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''One of Gore's real deficits, in terms of public image, is the leadership question,'' said a Democratic strategist who informally advises the Gore campaign. ''Curing that is more important than using Clinton's magic with the base. The question is, would Clinton's efforts in the fall undermine Gore's leadership image? It's a delicate question that can't be answered yet.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But the Gore campaign is likely to resist having the two men campaign side by side. Some of Mr. Gore's advisers would prefer that Mr. Clinton play a relatively minimal part in the postconvention campaign, similar to President Reagan's role in George Bush's 1988 campaign. Mr. Clinton, however, has made clear that he would like to do more.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While the Gore campaign clearly wants to keep its options open for the president, Democratic leaders in many of those battleground states have not been shy about voicing their opinions to the Gore campaign and to Mr. Clinton himself: they would like to see the president campaigning early and often on their home turf.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There's no one like the president who can communicate to voters,'' said Paul Berendt, chairman of the Washington State Democratic Party. ''I think he's the secret weapon of the Gore effort.''

  Mr. Giblin's remarks underscore a concern usually expressed privately by Democrats: that Mr. Gore is not connecting emotionally with Democrats as well as Mr. Bush is with Republicans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Several recent polls seem to confirm that worry. A Gallup survey in late June showed 75 percent of Democrats supporting Mr. Gore, compared with 91 percent of Republicans saying they would vote for Mr. Bush. And a poll released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press shows that Republican support for Mr. Bush is more intense than Democratic support for Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But many of those same Democrats also say Mr. Gore has suffered from the widespread perception, fair or not, that he is not particularly warm, engaging or likable.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Though warm-and-fuzzy biographical commercials for Mr. Gore and a feel-good Democratic convention could help him in the personality contest, many Democrats say they are also counting on Mr. Clinton to transfer some of his popularity to Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He can use his charm to get people to listen,'' said Roy Temple, executive director of the Democratic Party in Missouri, where a recent poll shows Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore. And when he gets them to listen, he can say, ''Who do you want to lead the country?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Al Gore doesn't have to have Bill Clinton campaigning to win,'' he added. ''But if you've got a resource like that, you use it to the fullest extent possible.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked if they were worried that Mr. Clinton would overshadow Mr. Gore on the stump, most of the Democratic leaders said no. Voters, they argued, would learn to accept the vice president for who he was once they focused on the campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And some political analysts contend that Mr. Clinton could provide a constant reminder of impeachment, Monica S. Lewinsky and campaign finance abuses that could drive conservative Democrats and independent voters into the arms of Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''My belief is, they've always wanted to punish Bill Clinton somehow, and they are going to do that by punishing Al Gore,'' said Ed Sarpolus, a Michigan-based pollster whose most recent survey shows Mr. Bush with a 12-point lead in Michigan. ''Until Gore separates himself, he'll be in trouble.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Democratic leaders say they are less worried about those issues than about Mr. Clinton's irrepressible fondness for the campaign, which, they say, could make him difficult to control. Once unleashed, will he follow the Gore script? Will he be willing to sing in the chorus and not interrupt the vice president's solos?

  ''He is a racehorse and when the elections roll around, he's eager to get out on the track,'' said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who talks to both the White House and the Gore campaign. ''But it will be Gore's call. I think Clinton wants to do what is best.''

  Recalling that he had helped write the news release announcing the formation of the group, Mr. Gore described its mission as similar to that of his presidential campaign today: to help the nation to escape the clutches of special interests, which, he said, had dragged it into recession and deficits when the Republicans were in charge.

  ''That's the true legacy of the Bush-Quayle years,'' Mr. Gore said, in his episodic effort to link Mr. Bush, his likely Republican rival, with Mr. Bush's father's presidency, which was rejected by the voters in 1992.

  ''I'm not going to see us dragged back to the tired old thinking that nearly destroyed the American dream,'' Mr. Gore said, saying that his proposed tax cuts for specific purposes like health care and education were preferable to across-the-board income-tax cuts.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has proposed $500 billion in tax cuts over 10 years. Mr. Bush has proposed $1.3 trillion in income-tax cuts over 10 years, which, Mr. Gore said, would bring the current prosperity to ''a screeching halt.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000

 <textdata>
  If tax cuts run slightly counter to the Democratic Leadership Council orthodoxy, Mr. Gore assured his audience that he would impose fiscal discipline.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I have been very clear, since the day I began this campaign, about what I am proposing,'' Mr. Gore said. ''An economic policy that's tried and tested and built on our values. Fiscal discipline as the foundation.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a sarcastic appraisal of the budget situation in Texas, Mr. Gore said the state faced a budget shortfall of $610 million, one that Democrats linked to Mr. Bush's $1.7 billion tax cut, but one that Republicans said would be more than covered by new surplus tax revenues, as long as the economic boom continued.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You might think that a governor whose state ranks dead last in the entire nation for families with health coverage, who then gets a surplus courtesy of the national economic boom, might turn his attention to moving from No. 50 to, say, 45, or maybe even better -- but nooo,'' Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Instead of taking up legislation to help families that desperately need health care, many of them going across the border to Mexico to try to find health care,'' he said. ''Instead of proposing legislation to help them, Governor Bush made a big tax break for the oil industry the very first bill that he signed that year. Now I don't really know how many oil executives in Texas lack health insurance, but I can tell you this -- a lot of children in Texas do.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He went on: ''This week, as Governor Bush was traveling from photo op to photo op, trying to put the compassion into his conservatism, we learned that he failed to use tens of millions of dollars budgeted to feed poor and hungry children during the summer months.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The vice president then said, ''When he was asked why Texas was suddenly facing a shortfall, Governor Bush told The Dallas Morning News, 'I hope I'm not here to have to deal with it.' ''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After the gasps died down, Mr. Gore added: ''With all due respect to Governor Bush, America can't afford to deal with it either.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said Mr. Gore was trying to have it both ways: first by criticizing Mr. Bush some months ago for not having to submit an actual budget the way other governors do, and now blaming this nonexistent budget for the shortfall. Mr. Bartlett also said that Mr. Bush had initiated an aggressive program to serve children, increasing the number being served to 260,000, from 175,000.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-16-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign also deployed Representative John Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee and has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for Mr. Bush, on the governor's behalf. He said in a telephone interview that Mr. Gore's speech was ''absurd,'' in part because the Clinton-Gore administration had submitted 13 supplemental budgets over the last seven years, spending plans that were submitted when the nation was ''several hundred million dollars in the hole.''

  In May, Gov. George W.

  ''Whether you agree with missile defenses or not, what Bush did was quite important,'' said Robert A. Manning, the director of Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, who said he has informally advised the Bush campaign. ''He was overturning a paradigm of the cold war, and saying Russia is not a problem, why target them?''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  BUT critics argue that any missile defenses will upset deterrence's delicate balance. Moscow fears that even a small system would be a step  toward a larger one that Russia could not afford to match. So it is threatening to freeze arms cuts if Washington bolts the treaty, as Mr. Bush has suggested he might do.

The line brought down the house on Wednesday at the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Baltimore, where Gov. George W. Bush spoke two days earlier.

  The audience had given Mr. Bush a polite hearing. ''For those of you who support me,'' he said, ''I see a couple here, maybe more than a couple: I hope you won't change your opinion.''

  The audience reserved their enthusiasm for Mr. Gore, which must have been something of a tonic to the presumptive Democratic nominee. Running neck and neck with or even slightly behind Mr. Bush in recent polls, the vice president needs a strong showing from black voters, who normally support Democrats in overwhelming numbers. Mr. Gore's staff is troubled by surveys showing that support to be less intense than in past campaigns.

  The vice president got another potential lift last week when his bitter primary rival, former Senator Bill Bradley, emerged to give reporters this message: ''I want to make it clear that I endorse Al Gore for president of the United States.''

  Things, meanwhile, have been going fairly smoothly this summer for Mr. Bush. So smoothly, in fact, that the Republican National Committee felt confident enough to put its television advertising campaign on his behalf on hiatus, even as the Democratic National Committee began running a new spot, on victims' rights, for Mr. Gore.

  Four more days of good news for Mr. Bush are on the horizon: the Republican National Convention begins in two weeks in Philadelphia, though how much the city shares in the potential public relations bonanza remains to be seen. Last week, television viewers across the nation watched the upsetting spectacle of the Philadelphia police beating a man accused of stealing a car and shooting an officer.

  Mr. Cheney then said, ''This notion that somehow I was opposed to freeing Nelson Mandela is a typical Al Gore distortion of a record, a point he's trying to make because he doesn't want to talk about real issues.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000

 <textdata>
  ''George W. Bush has now said to the African-American community, 'I give you my person, my candidate for vice president, and my person said no to Nelson Mandela when he was in prison,' '' said Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit, co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

  Little more than two weeks ago, Dick Cheney visited Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee in his office on Capitol Hill and Mr. Frist made his pitch, explaining why his experience as a heart surgeon managing life-and-death situations made him the right man to accompany Gov. George W. Bush along the inevitably rocky road to Election Day and, perhaps, the White House.

 </textdata>

  Several days after that, Mr. Bush flew to the Northeast and met twice with Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, discussing a possible place for Mr. Pataki on the Republican ticket.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For all this tantalizing activity, however, it now appears that Mr. Cheney had at the time already emerged as a leading candidate  -- and perhaps the leading candidate -- for the slot he had been assigned to help fill. Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush had discussed the possibility on July 3 at Mr. Bush's ranch near Crawford, about 90 miles north of here.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet Mr. Cheney's own candidacy was moving along a track so secret that some of the other politicians on the list of seemingly serious prospects had no idea that Mr. Bush was settling on him  until they learned it from newspaper and television reports about  72 hours before Mr. Bush formally announced his decision.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Prominent Republicans who discussed the vice-presidential selection with Mr. Bush over the past two weeks, among them Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, said that the Texas governor had not let on that he was considering the head of his search committee for the post. He also did not inquire about how such a selection might play, even as he reviewed with them the qualifications of other potential candidates on his list.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, the choice of Mr. Cheney was all but assured in the final days of frenzied speculation among news organizations, days that yielded some entirely unfounded reports: that Senator John McCain of Arizona might be a last-minute addition to Mr. Bush's short list; that Mr. Bush was making a final, hopeful approach to Gen. Colin L. Powell. Mr. Bush was really just running Mr. Cheney through his mind one last time.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cheney is an immensely respected political veteran, and his selection elicited praise from many Republicans. But the unusual way in which the former defense secretary ended up at Mr. Bush's side at a news conference here on Tuesday  to announce the vice-presidential selection has stirred concern among some Republicans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Additionally, Mr. Cheney's ties to former President George Bush have provoked renewed speculation about the influence of the governor's father on his son's presidential campaign. In a telephone interview today that represented his first public comments on the search process, President Bush said:  ''What I see emerging is that the old guy drove the choice. That is absolutely inaccurate.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And when he was asked if he had spoken directly to Mr. Cheney and urged him to think about taking the job, Mr. Bush said: ''I cannot reveal whether I did or didn't. Not wanting to obfuscate, but put this down to obfuscation.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm not going to get into what I talked to Dick Cheney or anybody else about,'' President Bush said. ''You've got to put it in the context of what Dick Cheney was doing.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  According to Mr. Bush's advisers, the review of Mr. Cheney's credentials and background materials was conducted somewhat outside of the process that Mr. Cheney had established for the rest of the field, and it went forward at a much speedier pace.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Within minutes after Mr. Cheney's selection was announced on Tuesday, Democrats produced a trove of extremely conservative votes from Mr. Cheney's decade in Congress, and the barrage of questions about his record that hit Mr. Cheney and the Bush campaign seemed to take them at least partly by surprise.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Of course I knew his votes,'' Mr. Bush said during a brief news conference today at the governor's mansion here today. ''But I also know his record. What do you expect? I'm running against people who all they do is spend time tearing people down. And they're going to give it their level best trying to tear Dick Cheney down, but they're not going to be able to do so.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also suggested that most Americans already knew and respected Mr. Cheney as a result of his role as defense secretary during the Persian Gulf war. ''Secretary Cheney brought people together and helped to win a war,'' he said, ''which stands in stark contrast with Vice President Al Gore, who tends to divide people to create war.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Through his aides, Mr. Bush declined to be interviewed for this article. Mr. Cheney did not respond to several requests for an interview about the search process that were made through Mr. Bush's aides.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But interviews with Republicans who spoke with Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush these past few weeks, including a number of men who were told they were on the short list of potential vice-presidential candidates, suggest that they underwent a process that was different from Mr. Cheney's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While Mr. Cheney took charge of reviewing financial histories and interviewing candidates, Mr. Bush himself attended to that chore in Mr. Cheney's case. While Mr. Cheney researched the voting records of the other vice-presidential prospects, the task of assessing Mr. Cheney's political past fell to Joe Allbaugh, the campaign manager. (Mr. Allbaugh also did not return a call for comment.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While other candidates began submitting their voluminous paperwork around the beginning of June, in some cases shipping boxes of documents to Mr. Cheney, the examination of Mr. Cheney apparently began little more than a week before Mr. Bush called him and offered him the job.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And while at least 11 Republicans filled out an extraordinarily detailed, 83-question form -- including inquiries about subjects ranging from plagiarism to recreational drug use -- Mr. Bush's senior advisers were unable to say if Mr. Cheney had taken the same step. They did note, however, that Mr. Cheney's background had been reviewed when he was named secretary of defense by President Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asked about Ms. Cheney's possible role in helping to screen candidates, including her father, Ms. Hughes said that except for Mr. Cheney, Mr. Bush and Mr. Allbaugh, ''I am not able to discuss others who were involved in the vetting process.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cheney said on ''Good Morning America'' that there was no cause for concern about the unusual way in which he came to be selected. Referring to Mr. Bush, he said:  ''The fact of the matter is that we spent a lot of time -- and again, remember my original advice to him was, you know, we're going to find you a great candidate, but I'd rather not be a candidate myself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's campaign has seemed genuinely invigorated by the news of Mr. Cheney's selection. Aides to the vice president were churning out reams of documents  about Mr. Cheney's legislative background literally from the moment Mr. Bush concluded the formal announcement of Mr. Cheney's selections.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many details of what is arguably the most important political decision Mr. Bush has made in his presidential campaign to date may never be known. The lack of information has prompted questions among some some Republicans about whether many of the politicians whose names were publicly floated as possible running mates for Mr. Bush were ever in serious contention.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania said in an interview that he had told aides on July 5 that he did not want to be considered for the race. Nevertheless, Mr. Bush himself continued to encourage speculation that he was considering Mr. Ridge when he campaigned with the Pennsylvania governor in Pittsburgh a week later.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Similarly, by the time Mr. Bush met with Mr. Pataki on July 14 -- an encounter that his aides readily confirmed -- Mr. Cheney, who has a history of heart attacks, had completed a medical examination in Washington and reported to Mr. Bush that he had been given a clean bill of health.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both Mr. Ridge and Mr. Pataki are supporters of abortion rights, unlike Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cheney, who is a staunch opponent of abortion, had been pitching in with the governor's presidential campaign from the beginning. Last year, he helped Mr. Bush assemble a team of foreign policy advisers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So perhaps it was natural that in mid-March, after Mr. Bush effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, he asked Mr. Cheney if he wanted to be considered as a possible running mate. Mr. Cheney said no, but, weeks later, agreed to supervise the search process.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The candidate who had been mentioned as potentially the strongest running mate Mr. Bush could chose, Mr. Powell, explicitly told Mr. Bush that he did not want the job. He did so during a private moment with the governor on May 25, when Mr. Bush held a  ceremony here pledging support for Mr. Powell's national youth-mentoring program, an aide to Mr. Powell said this week. Mr. Bush and his senior advisers never raised the subject with Mr. Powell again, the aide said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still there was no hint yet that Mr. Cheney's professed reluctance to consider the job was softening, Mr. Bush's advisers said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But on June 27 -- just six days before Mr. Cheney visited Mr. Bush's ranch and indicated a possible willingness to run for the post -- his name popped up at a gathering of former members of his father's presidential administration at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Me. Those present included President Bush; his former national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft; and his former director of presidential personnel, Chase Untermeyer.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Untermeyer recalled that as these men and others sat around a table on the back porch, President Bush asked in a lighthearted manner who they thought should be his son's vice-presidential pick.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''My impression was that President Bush was very interested to hear that, and took it aboard as if it was an important fact to know,'' Mr. Untermeyer said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Scowcroft and President Bush both made telephone calls to a reporter today to dispute the accuracy of that account. Mr. Scowcroft said that before the Kennebunkport meeting, he had run into Mr. Cheney and teased him about being the perfect vice-presidential prospect. Mr. Scowcroft said that he merely shared that story with President Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  President Bush said that he did not press the idea of Mr. Cheney on his son.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On July 11, Ms. Hughes said, he got his medical examination. On July 15 he and Mr. Bush informed Mr. Bush's senior advisers that he was in the running, and his vetting began, according to Ms. Hughes.

  Yet the fears Mr. Daley expressed last spring over the fate of the China bill have come true: It became a political hostage while the White House and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, clashed over annual appropriations bills and while Democrats focused on unrelated legislative goals. Meanwhile, the political needs of the Gore campaign sidelined Mr. Daley from the White House lobbying campaign to pass the trade bill, leaving Steven Richetti, a less prominent political hand, in charge of the effort.
 </textdata>

  Administration officials said that China remained one of Mr. Clinton's foremost priorities. But since the bill passed the House, the president and many of his top aides have been focused on other issues that will shape his legacy, including brokering a Middle East peace accord, rejecting Republican tax-cut initiatives and, perhaps most of all, helping Mr. Gore become president.

  Governor Thompson said tonight that he hoped the draft reflected ''a more uplifting view of the Republican Party, one that's more inclusive, that attempts to build a winning team, that people can rally around.''  He said it was also intended to reflect the Bush philosophy, adding that he took the chairman's job ''because my friend the governor asked me to do it.''

  As written, the document is in large part a road map of the Bush campaign's political strategy in the general election. The section on immigration, for example, no longer demands a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to the children born of illegal immigrants, as it did four years ago. Rather than calling for ''the official recognition of English as the nation's common language,'' it declares, ''Another sign of our unity is the role of English as our common language.''  The tone, in general, is far more welcoming, reflecting Republicans' efforts to reach out to Hispanics and other immigrant groups.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Similarly, the document includes a careful appeal to women, pledging the party's commitment to women's health issues, and to the elderly, considered a critical swing vote this year. It promises to give Medicare ''a new lease on life,'' by giving each of its 39 million beneficiaries a choice of health plans, an allusion to efforts to get more private insurance plans involved in Medicare. And it accuses the Clinton administration of treating ''Social Security as a slogan rather than a priority,'' while heralding Mr. Bush's proposal to allow people to invest part of their payroll taxes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The platform attacks the Supreme Court's recent decision overturning state laws that barred what opponents call ''partial-birth'' abortion, asserting that the decision ''shocks the conscience of the nation.'' And while Mr. Bush says he would allow abortions in the case of rape, incest and to save the life of the woman, the platform remains unswervingly opposed. Mr. Bush and other Republican leaders had promised the anti-abortion movement early on that the abortion plank would not change.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Republican aides said the document was intended to sound a far less combative tone than the 1996 platform, which is in keeping with the Bush campaign's effort to present its candidate as ''a uniter, not a divider.'' At times, the references are opaque: In a section titled, ''Government for the People,'' the draft is apparently referring to the impeachment of Mr. Clinton when it declares: ''At a time when the nation felt betrayed by misconduct in high office, the Republican Congress responded with gravity and high purpose. We applaud those members who did their duty to conscience and the Constitution.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The platform goes to great lengths, though, to try to build a case against giving the Democrats any credit for the current economic boom. It argues that the economy was a ''shambles'' under President Jimmy Carter, was saved by the Reagan and Bush administrations, and was jeopardized anew by the election of the Clinton administration in 1992, although that election occurred in a recession. Only the ''honesty and guts'' of a Republican Congress managed to erase the budget deficit and steady the economy for this  boom, the platform draft declares.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Thompson said the draft was written by the staff of the Republican National Committee, the Bush campaign and his own operation, under the guidance of him and his two co-chairs, Representative Sue Myrick of North Carolina and Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee.

  I agree that George W.

Governor Bush is indeed more concerned with governing than with politics, a quality of a true leader. He chose ability over flash. He is looking to develop a strong team to successfully lead the country rather than simply creating a political machine to garner votes.

  ''The Gore and Bush soft money ads are clearly campaign ads designed and intended to promote the presidential candidates, are created by members of the presidential campaigns, are targeted to run in key presidential battleground states, are indistinguishable from other presidential campaign ads and are without question 'for the purpose of influencing' the presidential campaigns,'' the letter stated.

  As the state capital, Nashville remains a cockpit of political drama. Closely divided between the two parties, Tennessee has produced prominent Democrats like Cordell Hull, Franklin D. Roosevelt's secretary of state; Estes Kefauver, the 1956 vice presidential nominee; and Albert Gore Sr. It has produced powerful Republicans like Howard H. Baker Jr. and Lamar Alexander. They play the game for keeps here, and they don't forget; in casual conversation six years after he lost his seat, former Senator Jim Sasser bitterly condemned the Republican politicians who had denied him a fourth term as ''reactionary know-nothings.''

  But the two groups have a few things in common. The whole town assuages its sweet tooth with a locally produced candy called Goo-Goo Clusters, a highly caloric confection of peanuts, chocolate, caramel and marshmallow. Ronald Reagan took jelly beans to the White House; if Al Gore wins the presidency this year, look for him to stock the Oval Office with Goo-Goo Clusters.

  Among the aircraft to be displayed is the V-22 Osprey, which has crashed three times in the past decade. It is a hybrid with rotors that swivel so it can take off like a helicopter but cruise like a turboprop commuter plane. The Osprey has been beset by controversy over cost and mission as well as safety, and Mr. Cheney waged a long and unsuccessful battle against it when he was in the Bush administration.

  That could be forestalled by the presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, which has been structuring the convention to make it free of controversy. But the spectacle of politicians' arguing about political calendars, rather than something so emotional as abortion, might not seem harmful, especially if it took place on Monday morning, when only a couple of cable networks were covering the convention.

  TUNING OUT THE NEWS  Journalists' coverage of the characters of the presidential contenders has had little effect on voters' perception of the characters of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, according to a study released yesterday. The study's authors at the Project for Excellence in Journalism, in Washington, said that journalists' statements about a candidate's character -- that Mr. Bush was inexperienced, for example, or that Mr. Gore was prone to stretch the truth -- were usually accompanied with supporting evidence but that denials of such assertions were given short shrift. The study examined a sampling of five months of election coverage in 17 news outlets, including network news broadcasts, Sunday morning talk shows, cable news talk shows, national and regional newspapers and online publications. The study compared the themes the journalists emphasized with voters' perceptions of the candidates, as measured in a separate survey of 1,204 potential voters conducted by the Pew Research Center. The comparison indicated that voters gave issues like Mr. Bush's family connections or Mr. Gore's fund-raising tactics substantially different weight than journalists did. The journalists' ''lens on what's being said by one candidate or others doesn't affect the public,'' said Amy Mitchell, one of the study's authors. But, the study noted, journalists offered no evidence for their statements or cited the work of other journalists about one-quarter of the time that they made assertions about the candidates' characters. The researchers found that coverage of Mr. Bush tended to rely on his conduct of this campaign for evidence about his character, while coverage of Mr. Gore tended to rely on his record in Congress, the Senate and the Clinton administration.

  GORE 'MULLING' OVER NO. 2  Speculation may be swirling around Vice President Al Gore's decision on a running mate, but Mr. Gore was the picture of tranquillity yesterday as he sought to begin a vacation with his family on a private island off North Carolina. Mr. Gore told reporters that he had pretty much finished his interview process for a running mate and was entering the ''mulling'' phase of his decision, but he gave no clue as to where that  might take him and would not offer up any names. ''I've got the luxury of time to kind of sit and let things settle for a while,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I have not even preliminarily picked someone.'' He said there were fewer than 10 people on his list of candidates. And he said that none of them would visit him while he was on vacation. He did say he would probably talk with Warren Christopher, who is heading his search for a running mate.

  And a loose coalition of gun-control groups has pledged to spend several million dollars helping to elect their friends, most of them Democrats.

  Over the last few months Al Gore has been campaigning like crazy, unfazed by your inattention. His current message is that George W. Bush would turn the country into another Texas, a place Mr. Gore has been depicting as a sort of Burkina Faso with oil rigs. This pitch might work slightly better if Mr. Gore himself had not spent so many years as Number Two to the former governor of Arkansas. But the Democratic National Committee lent a hand the other day, somberly issuing a traveler's warning that urged visitors to the Lone Star State to update their immunization shots. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush has been proceeding at a more leisurely pace -- being inclusive, bonding with Dick Cheney and building his dream ranch house. This is going to be the only presidential candidate in history who spends the campaign working on his retirement home.

  Mr. Bush spoke as Mr. Cheney, for a second straight day, was called on to explain positions he took as a congressman from Wyoming, including votes against the equal rights amendment, gun control and sanctions on South Africa's apartheid government.
 </textdata>

  Democrats have highlighted those stands to undercut Mr. Bush's efforts to define himself as a ''different kind of Republican.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Several hours later Mr. Bush made a brief appearance before reporters, taking time out from practicing his acceptance speech for his nomination next week, and maintained that he had not been blindsided by Mr. Cheney's record.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Of course I knew his votes,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But I also know his record. What do you expect? I'm running against people who all they do is spend time tearing people down.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000

  The Democrats kept up their efforts to use Mr. Cheney's record as a way of tying Mr. Bush to a Republican establishment of the past.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''What Cheney's selection has done is given us a rather vivid picture of old guard Republicanism,'' said Mark Fabiani, a deputy Gore campaign manager. And, Mr. Fabiani said, ''some of his past votes are hard to explain away in any era.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The difficulty for Mr. Bush is that some of the stands of his running mate cut right to the heart of the way he has been seeking to define himself as a ''compassionate conservative.'' Mr. Bush has put a heavy premium on education, for example, and Mr. Cheney voted against the Head Start program.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush regularly surrounds himself with members of minorities and recently spoke at the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

  And on ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' he tried to turn the scrutiny to Mr. Gore, whose position on gun issues has changed since his first years in Congress. ''At the same time that I was doing that, casting those votes, Al Gore was receiving an A rating from the National Rifle Association,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''He was pro-gun and anti-gun-control.''

  ''We don't need Dad in this race,'' George W.

  Indeed, one of the few traits that Governor Bush and Vice President Al Gore seem to have in common is the dilemma of being the son of a famous politician. Mr. Bush probably has the harder task in containing the offstage presence of a very lively 76-year-old  former president. But Mr. Gore's candidacy is haunted, in a way, by the golden-throated ghost of Senator Albert Gore Sr., who died in 1998.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even today, the father's reputation competes with the son's reality. Albert Gore Sr. was a famous orator. The son turns to stone at the teleprompter. Vice President Gore is accused of pandering. Senior lost his Senate seat rather than alter his opposition to the Vietnam War. The father had the advantage of an impoverished Tennessee boyhood. Albert Gore Jr. used their Tennessee farm as a summer camp.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For all that, Governor Bush faces the tougher, day-to-day threat of being miniaturized by a living ex-president. The elder Mr. Bush inflicted unintended collateral damage at a rally before the New Hampshire primary by referring to his son as ''this boy.'' In a subsequent interview with The New York Times, President Bush and his wife, Barbara, took what appeared to be a pledge of non-interference.

  But family discipline seemed to break down during the process of putting Dick Cheney on the ticket. Governor Bush acknowledged ''kibitzing'' by his father, apparently code for days of lobbying by the former president for his secretary of defense. A fatherly call to the elderly Texas heart surgeon Denton Cooley about Mr. Cheney's health was also made public.

  President Bush, in damage-control mode, said yesterday that it was ''absolutely inaccurate'' to say he had driven the choice of Mr. Cheney. But in fact the whole process took on a very retro, Texas-elite, Bush-senior look. The psychological signal was even more damaging, as if by pushing Mr. Cheney President Bush was saying, Don't worry: when my son makes decisions, adults will be in the room.

  Neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gore is quite there yet. True, Mr. Gore now outranks his father, but he is not yet perceived as having made the step from scion to paterfamilias. That could argue for picking a junior figure for a running mate. Mr. Bush has gone in the other direction, putting a de facto father on the ticket at the urging of his real father in Houston. Governor Bush cites this as proof of his inner security, and it may be. But he still has to worry that voters will read it as a sign of a son not yet risen to full autonomy.

  SANDY HOOK: CRITICISM OF GORE -- Three days after Vice President Al Gore was endorsed for president by the Sierra Club, a New Jersey environmental group criticized him on ocean dumping. The group, Clean Ocean Action, sent Mr. Gore a letter on Wednesday, the fourth anniversary of an agreement he brokered in 1996 to limit dumping at the mud dump six miles off Sandy Hook. Clean Ocean Action signed onto the agreement, but now says the United States Environmental Protection Agency's standards undermine the agreement by allowing some dumping to continue. Mr. Gore supports the federal agency.

  Al Butkus, the president of an engineering firm who said he would vote for George W.

  Ms. Wilson, with two children and a husband who is also a lawyer, said she was fairly certain that Mr. Gore agreed with her on education, the environment, affirmative action and other issues, but she had reservations about ''him as a person.'' She said she believed, for example, that he was ''pandering'' when he said that Elian Gonzalez and his father should be given permanent residency status, and she called his ethics on campaign financing ''a little loose.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. Butkus, 48, who typically backs Republicans for president, said of Governor Bush: ''He doesn't have a lot of political experience. There's just not a big book on him to let you now how he'd act in situations.'' He said he was ''not happy'' with Mr. Bush's vague response about whether he had used cocaine, but added, ''There's abuses on the other side.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-28-2000

  ''The one thing I'm impressed with Bush about is that he has been picking good people and they're sticking by him,'' Mr. Butkus said.

  ''I want someone who's going to have a balance in being generally businesslike in the management of government,'' said Don Colleton, a 58-year-old lawyer leaning toward Mr. Bush.

I want folks to behave in a way that is just resolute in acknowledging the intrinsic equal dignity of members of the human race, whatever color or size they come in.''

  Most of those interviewed said their view of President Clinton would not affect their vote.

  One exception was Lorraine Morton, the Democratic mayor of Evanston, who said she did not have ''great enthusiasm'' for Mr. Gore, but ''Clinton did a fantastic job,'' and if elected, ''Gore can pick up the telephone and say, 'Bill. what do you think about so and so.' ''

  These days a world-class zoological achievement is just one more item on a list of new downtown attractions that are helping Indianapolis shine. Public and private investment downtown totaled $3 billion in the 1990's, and an additional $1.5 billion worth of projects will open over the next two years. Much of the construction, including a minor league baseball park, a new arena for the Pacers basketball team, a $14.5 million botanical garden next to the zoo and a new 165,000-square-foot headquarters for the Indiana Historical Society, came during the tenure of Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, who is now a top domestic-policy adviser in the presidential campaign of Gov. George Bush of Texas. Mr. Goldsmith's successor is Bart Peterson, the first Democratic mayor here in decades. Mr. Peterson called Amali's birth ''a great success story for our zoo and a great international attraction.''

  This year, the streak may be in jeopardy, and in many respects, the challenge facing Representative Mark Udall, who is seeking a second term, mirrors a problem that Vice President Al Gore has encountered in his quest for the presidency: both could lose the election because of a Green Party candidate siphoning Democratic votes.

  The idea is to try to take advantage of the momentum that presidential candidates traditionally gain after their conventions. The formula was a huge success for Bill Clinton and Mr. Gore after the 1992 convention, when they rode a bus with their wives across small-town America -- and secondary media markets -- where presidential candidates seldom visit in the heat of a campaign.

  This year's Democratic convention runs from Aug. 14 through 17, putting the boat trip in one of the slowest news cycles of the year. That means Mr. Gore will probably not face much competition from other news events for attention, but it also means many voters will be on vacation and tuned out of the campaign.

  The Gore camp is looking to the next several weeks as its chance to try to catch Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the polls. There is talk, officials said, of Mr. Gore's announcing his vice-presidential selection in early August to cut into the momentum that Mr. Bush is expected to receive from the Philadelphia convention, which begins on July 31.

  The Gore campaign has been looking to this period as a time for Mr. Gore to seize the attention, energize his supporters and establish himself as his own person. Because Mr. Gore has had difficulty establishing his own identity apart from President Clinton, the Gore team has scheduled the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton to speak on the convention's opening night. It intends to devote the remaining days to Mr. Gore.

  If there is anything as inevitable as death  and taxes, it is the fact that the presidential candidates will be debating tax policy. Certainly the differing proposals by both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore to cut taxes will keep the issue before the voters. Later in the campaign, we will be looking at the details of their plans. But at this early stage, we feel it would be useful to define some broad principles that ought to govern the choice of potential tax cuts. The threshold question that needs to be asked is whether tax cuts of any kind are the best way to bring about economic growth as well as progressive policy goals like expanded health care.

  If there is to be a tax cut, it should make the tax code more simple, fair and progressive. Progres-sivity is a time-honored principle often forgotten in  the political debates. But since the beginning of this century, Americans have consistently embraced the principle that calls for the wealthy to pay proportionately larger shares of their income in taxes. The tax system became less progressive after the tax cuts of President Ronald Reagan and more progressive after tax increases under Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton. The latest Treasury estimate is that the top fifth of American families accounts for 56.7 percent of American family income but 65.1 percent of total federal tax revenues. The top 1 percent accounts for 14.8 percent of total income and 20.1 percent of tax revenues. These rates do not make for an excessively progressive tax system.

  In the years since then, however, many more tax breaks have been introduced. Faced with a Republican Congress, President Clinton has been a master at expanding the role of the federal government, not by spending programs but by tax credits for child care, education and other activities. Now both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have moved in the direction of more tax breaks. The Texas governor calls for new tax credits for long-term health care, education, health insurance, charitable giving and adoptions. Mr. Gore proposes tax credits for health insurance premiums, after-school care, college tuition and retirement savings. All these proposals make the tax code more complex, adding to the billions it already costs taxpayers simply to prepare their forms. Rather than indiscriminately handing out more tax incentives, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush should consider simplifying the code and achieving the lower tax rates they think the voters are demanding in an across-the-board but progressive way.

  Using an Incumbent's Strategy  Gov. George W. Bush has been taking a low-key approach to campaigning lately. The style and schedule are deliberate, reflecting the campaign's strategic confidence that he can mold his image by carefully choreographing television images in battleground states. It is almost as if he is running a modified version of an incumbent's Rose Garden strategy.

  Green Party Role in Colorado  The challenge facing Representative Mark Udall of Colorado mirrors a problem that Vice President Al Gore has encountered in his quest for the presidency: Both could lose the election because of a Green Party candidate siphoning off Democratic votes. In Mr. Gore's case, a strong showing by Ralph Nader could swing an otherwise close election to Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Udall faces Ron Forthofer, in a district where many Democratic voters feel the party has abandoned them.

  Neither candidate revealed anything about his vice-presidential selection process. Mr. Bush said that while Gen. Colin Powell was not interested in the vice presidency, he might accept another post. Speculation has centered on secretary of state.
 </textdata>

  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The interviews also underscored the political needs of each candidate as the campaign headed toward the  conventions. Mr. Bush, who leads in the polls, seemed content to keep the conversation vague, a posture that could allow voters to read what they want to into him. Mr. Gore, on the other hand, has been eager for direct debates with Mr. Bush. His advisers contend that once voters can compare Mr. Gore's grasp of policy and his center-left positions with what they say is Mr. Bush's right-wing bent, Mr. Gore will win the election.
 </textdata>

  At the same time, the third party candidates, Ralph Nader and Patrick J. Buchanan, also appeared on talk programs. Mr. Nader said on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' that he was not worried about siphoning votes from Mr. Gore, even if it could cost Mr. Gore the presidency.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000

  ''I wouldn't be running if I were worried about taking votes away from Al Gore or George W. Bush,'' Mr. Nader said. ''Nobody is entitled to votes. They have to earn them.''
 </textdata>

  On the same program, Mr. Buchanan was asked whether Mr. Bush might choose a running mate who favored abortion rights. ''Mr. Bush is blowing smoke,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ''He would have an explosion at his convention.''

  Mr. Gore underwent scrutiny of his Social Security plan. Mr. Russert said repeatedly that Mr. Gore's proposal was based on a rosy assumption that anticipated budget surpluses for the next 40 years. Mr. Gore said his plan would keep the Social Security trust fund sacrosanct and, by eliminating the national debt by 2012, would help extend the life of the entitlement program.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Russert noted that the Clinton-Gore budget for 2000 had proposed increasing the money for Social Security by investing some of the budget surplus set aside for Social Security ''in corporate equities or other private financial instruments.'' Mr. Russert described the difference between the two candidates' approaches this way, ''You want the government to invest in the market; George Bush wants individuals to invest.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said he did not support that proposal, even though it was in the administration's budget, and he called it a trial balloon. The vice president said Mr. Bush's plan for privatizing part of Social Security would be a ''catastrophe.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''What he wants to do is to divert 16 percent of the money that's going into the trust fund and put it into the stock market now,'' Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000

  Mr. Bush refused to answer whether, under his plan, the government would protect individuals against any losses.
 </textdata>

  ''A safe return -- the safest of all investment vehicles -- yields about twice what the Social Security Trust is getting today,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There's going to be a lot of discussions about the particulars of the plan,'' Mr. Bush said.

  Asked whether he agreed with the details of one of the proposals on Capitol Hill to overhaul Medicare, Mr. Bush said, ''I believe the next president must put Republicans and Democrats in a room and say, 'Let's reform Medicare.' ''

 </date>
 <textdata>
  When asked if the Republican Congress should accept a deal with President Clinton to cut the marriage penalty in exchange for funding Medicare to cover prescription drugs, Mr. Bush said: ''That's up to this current Congress and this current president.

  Mr. Russert highlighted some of the changes that Mr. Gore has made on various issues over the years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore, who favors abortion rights, was asked if he believed that life began at conception. ''No,'' he said. Asked when life did begin, Mr. Gore said, ''There is a developmental process during which the burden kind of shifts over time,'' citing the first trimester of a pregnancy as being different from the third, but not pinpointing a time when he thought life began.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Russert pointed out that, in 1987, Mr. Gore had opposed federal funding for abortions for poor women and had called abortion ''arguably the taking of a human life.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore acknowledged that he had changed his position, saying he did so about 15 years ago. ''I talked to a lot of women who taught me about the kinds of circumstances that can come up and the kinds of dilemmas that women can face,'' he said. ''I've come to the very deep conviction that a woman's right to choose must be protected regardless of the woman's income.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Of a vote that he had cast that would define the term ''person'' to include the unborn, Mr. Gore said, ''That was a very odd procedural vote.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the death penalty, Mr. Gore said he did not support a national moratorium on executions for the 21 federal prisoners who are on death row. But he said he did support the moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois ''based on the extraordinary number of errors'' found in those cases.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore had been quoted as saying that with the death penalty, ''there are always going to be some small numbers of errors.'' Today Mr. Gore said he wanted zero errors but sometimes because of human imperfection, even jury verdicts ''sometimes produce a mistake.'' But he said he was unaware of any involving the trials of the 21 federal death-row inmates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He also hinted that any state with questionable executions would do well to consider a moratorium. He did not mention Texas, however, a state that has the highest number of executions. Because of Mr. Gore's position on the death penalty, he has refrained from criticizing Mr. Bush's record on executions. Since Mr. Bush took office in 1995, Texas has executed 137 people, more than twice as many as the next highest state, Virginia.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has said that he was certain that every execution in Texas had been warranted, that the inmates had been guilty and had had full access to the appeals process. Today, Cokie Roberts directed him to the case of Odell Barnes, who was executed in March even though several questions had been raised about his case. He was convicted of raping and murdering Helen Bass, a 42-year-old nurse who was his mother's best friend. Mr. Barnes went to his death insisting that he had had a sexual relationship with Ms. Bass but that he had not killed her.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Well, I don't remember the specifics of Odell Barnes,'' Mr. Bush said. ''You know, and I'm not castigating it. I wish you would have given me a chance to bring the full dossier so that I could have discussed it in detail with you.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush concluded: ''If you ask me whether or not I think we've ever executed an innocent person, my answer to you is no, I don't believe so. And I've reviewed every single case. And I spend a lot of time on them, as do a lot of courts and lawyers and a board of pardons and paroles.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Gore was asked about a recent Supreme Court decision that said the Boy Scouts could exclude gay members. Mr. Gore said he had not read the opinion and offered none of his own.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Russert posed a series of questions on the investigations into Mr. Gore's financial activities in the 1996 campaign. Mr. Gore said Mr. Russert was ''beating a dead horse.'' Asked if his visit to a Buddhist temple in 1996 was a fund-raising event, Mr. Gore said, ''I believe it was not,'' adding, ''There was no request for funds, no money changed hands.''

  Mr. Bush's signature campaign events are small panel discussions that more resemble seminars on social services. Ostensibly, the sessions are about new policy proposals. But Mr. Bush's aides say they are just as much about mood, emotion and image. As the once troubled teenagers and single mothers who make up the panels tell Mr. Bush how they have overcome hardship, he responds with emotive language, words and phrases like ''love'' or  ''loving family'' or ''willing heart.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000

 <textdata>
  The style and schedule that Mr. Bush is keeping is deliberate, reflecting the campaign's strategic confidence that he can mold his image by carefully choreographing television images in battleground states.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That is not to say that Mr. Bush is not working hard. His days are filled with fund-raisers, policy meetings and interviews with reporters. He is putting the last touches on his convention speech, and is in the final phase of choosing a running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, Mr. Bush's style could not be more different from that of his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, who is generally running behind in the polls and has longer, more event-packed campaign days. Mr. Gore takes question after question from larger audiences, showing off a detailed knowledge of subjects like immigration law and the history of Medicare.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000

 <textdata>
  But while the presidential race is only now moving into the critical convention period, Mr. Bush and his aides say his method of campaigning has produced good results. It has put him ahead in many crucial states and made him competitive in ones the Democrats had counted on.

  At Bush headquarters in Austin, Tex., the staff keeps a blue and red color-coded electoral map that shows which way each state is leaning. Bush aides right now have a panorama showing Mr. Bush leading in states that are worth a combined 345 electoral votes and Mr. Gore leading in states worth a combined 92 electoral votes. The map shows states representing 101 electoral votes up for grabs. A candidate needs 270 to win the presidency.
 </textdata>

  ''The good news is I'm leading some of the polls,'' Mr. Bush told state Republican officials gathered in Austin last week. ''The bad news is the election isn't tomorrow.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So confident are the Republicans that after running about $5 million in advertisements promoting Mr. Bush's Social Security proposals, they let the Democrats spend about $14 million in key states on commercials promoting Mr. Gore and Democratic issues without responding.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The race stayed the same,'' one Bush adviser said. The Republican Party is readying a new advertising campaign to lead into the Republican National Convention in two weeks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides attribute the state of the presidential race partly to a series of missteps by Mr. Gore over a rocky spring. But they also point to Mr. Bush's turn to a policy-oriented campaign style after the primaries ended. That was when he needed to erase the bitterness of his fight with Senator McCain and soften the hard conservative edges he had created for himself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Candidates tend to repeat the successes of the past,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I found that ideas do drive campaigns.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is using the same phrases he did more than a year ago, that he is a ''compassionate conservative,'' that he wants to fight the ''soft bigotry of low expectations'' for minority students in public schools, that he wants to rally ''the armies of compassion.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The groundwork for the policy offensive was set more than a year ago. Mr. Bush named three senior advisers for policy: Lawrence B. Lindsey for the economy, Stephen Goldsmith for domestic affairs and Condoleezza Rice for national security. He also assembled a large think tank under the leadership of Josh Bolten, who had worked in the administration of Mr. Bush's father.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The first speeches on education and health care and the environment put Mr. Bush squarely on Democratic turf with reading programs for poor areas and tax credits to help people who lack health insurance.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Then came broad proposals to reshape Social Security and rethink nuclear policy. They skipped all of the devilish details. But Mr. Bush's aides say they showed voters that Mr. Bush was willing to take risks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  These latest proposals may seem small, but aides say Mr. Bush is using the ideas to shape his image. In a year in which no issue is dominating, a Bush adviser said, ''issues are important but they are important as reflections of broader values and keys into a candidate's leadership.'' He said independent swing voters ''are not taking their stands on individual issues, but their feelings about what values the candidate reflects.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Normally, a result is that in swing state after swing state, evening news programs show Mr. Bush surrounded by winsome minority children or troubled teenagers or poor-but-determined single mothers talking of hopes for building a better life. Only rarely is the script interrupted the way it was on Friday in New Jersey when a minister challenged Mr. Bush about the death penalty.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000

 <textdata>
  The dynamics of the presidential race could well change by the fall. Mr. Gore's aides say that a vice president traditionally does not come out from under the shadow of the president until the party convention. And they argue that the public still favors Democratic positions on issues, that Mr. Gore is better under pressure and that he will shine when the candidates meet in debates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-17-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The governor promised today that he would not lie back and let Mr. Gore criticize his positions and his Texas record. ''I'm a good counterpuncher,'' he said on the ABC program ''This Week.'' ''I am.''

  Mr. Archer said Medicare would not be affected because the budget surplus would allow additional general tax revenues to go to Medicare in place of the revenue lost from repeal of the tax. He suggested that Republicans were ready to make the debate an issue in the election, noting that it was Vice President Al Gore who had cast the deciding vote, in his role as tiebreaker in the Senate, to implement Mr. Clinton's 1993 budget plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  A common assumption was that it would not be clear until Tuesday, the eve of Mr. Clinton's scheduled departure for Japan, whether the talks are ''going in the right direction or not,'' the official added. Only then would the White House decide whether the talks were ripe enough to warrant keeping Mr. Clinton at Camp David and sending Vice President Al Gore to the meeting in Okinawa of the leaders of the world's major industrial nations. Mr. Clinton is scheduled to leave on Wednesday to join other leaders there and meet the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.

  The group has been lining up support for eliminating the moratorium from senators like Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, and John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, who was a chief proponent of the ban when it was imposed in 1996, has signaled a softening in his stance. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the probable Republican presidential nominee, also favors individual quotas.

  ''This tool vests fishermen with an incentive to conserve the fishery, eliminates such bureaucratic restrictions as minimum size limits and season closings and reduces dangerous operating conditions,'' Mr. Bush wrote in an April 28 letter to Ms. Hutchison.

  Indeed, in Dr. Postol's view, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and Lt. Gen. Ronald T. Kadish, the head of the Pentagon's ballistic missile office, are ''technically illiterate'' about missile defense. Condoleezza Rice, the chief foreign policy adviser for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is ''not interested in the truth.'' Leon S. Fuerth, the national security adviser for Vice President Al Gore, is ''uninformed and shows no interest in becoming informed.''

  Did the Democratic governors, by predicting a post-convention collapse of the Bush campaign, see a parallel with the 1988 campaign of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts? Mr. Dukakis, a Democrat, led Governor Bush's father by a substantial margin for months but faltered after the conventions.

  The Republican candidate for Senate, Rick A. Lazio, represents Suffolk County, on the state's eastern stretch of suburban life, Long Island. The Democrat, Hillary Rodham Clinton, moved from the White House to Chappaqua, in suburban Westchester. And the Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush, is running as a social moderate and fiscal conservative -- in other words, he's positioned himself as the candidate of suburbia.

  FOR instance, the city vote remains solidly Democratic, but now that it accounts for as little as 29 percent of the statewide vote (down from 41 percent in 1960), Mrs. Clinton and Al Gore will need to do well upstate and in the suburbs even if they get overwhelming support in the city.

  Vice President Al Gore doubled his proposed tax-cutting package a few weeks ago, to $500 billion over 10 years, moving him closer to the $1.3 trillion plan offered by his Republican rival for the presidency, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.

  ACCURACY -- Raising educational standards was one of the first issues the governor staked out during the primaries, and he has augmented his advocacy with a series of proposals to increase federal education spending, including a $2.3 billion plan to strengthen math and science education and $2.9 billion to upgrade teacher training. The reference to improvements in standards and pupil performance in Texas is based partly on the results of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test. The campaign says that average scores have improved in each of the last four years and that the percentage of minority students who have passed the test rose to 69 percent in 1999 from 38 percent in 1994. The Gore campaign, however, challenged Mr. Bush's record, contending that Texas's average SAT scores remain among the lowest in the country and that some children's rights groups rank the state near the bottom as a place to raise a family.

  SCORECARD -- This issue advertisement, paid for in part with the soft money donated to the parties in unrestricted amounts, is supposed to refrain from electioneering. But like all of the spots that the Democratic and Republican parties are running this year, it does not try to disguise its intention to convince people to vote for Mr. Bush. Like many of the advertisements produced by the Bush campaign, the party's commercial spotlights the affable candidate, espousing the values he has labeled compassionate conservatism. The script is filled with words like ''courage,'' ''discipline'' and ''standards,'' all meant to convey a highly moral core to a benevolent policy.

  The conventional wisdom that the Republican ticket can never include a pro-choice vice-presidential candidate seems to be eroding. That is a good sign for the party's long-ignored moderate wing and for those who would like to see the Northeast play a stronger role in the G.O.P. The party's expected nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, ought to look closely at this chance to show that he has the spine to stand up to the intimidators from the religious right, a faction that exerted an outsized influence during his father's administration. By selecting a pro-choice running mate, Mr. Bush would also be pulling the party more into alignment with suburban moderates who in numerical terms are more important to the G.O.P. than the anti-abortion movement.

Such is General Powell's popularity that his selection would silence all but the most militant pro-lifers.

  No doubt Mr. Bush will hear warnings that anti-abortion forces could desert the party and even disrupt the convention if he defies them. Bolder advisers might argue that in his recent appearances, including his visit to the N.A.A.C.P. convention, Mr. Bush has attempted to reach beyond normal Republican territory. His political statements on education and Social Security also show Mr. Bush attempting to label himself as a more flexible and independent-minded kind of Republican. A pro-choice running mate would reassure swing voters who worry that Governor Bush is a pleasant man with a secret hard-line agenda. Such voters would surely be impressed if Mr. Bush could get Pat Robertson and others in the Christian right to hold still for a running mate with some pro-choice credentials.

 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  The videotape is sensitive because it shows both President Clinton and Mr. Gore and contains two apparent references to James T.

  The videotape is sensitive because it shows both President Clinton and Mr. Gore and contains two apparent references to James T.

 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the tape of the event, which took place on Dec. 15, 1995, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Mr. Gore addresses Arief Wiriadinata, an Indonesian gardener who illegally contributed $455,000 to the Democratic Party earlier that year, Mr. Burton's investigators said. The vice president apparently mentions Mr. Riady, the investigators said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore is heard telling Mr. Wiriadinata that political issue television advertisements, paid for by large contributors to the Democratic Party, should be shown to Mr. Riady, Mr. Burton's investigators said. Mr. Riady did not contribute any money to the Democrats in either 1995 or 1996.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore is not seen on the tape saying those words, but Mr. Burton and committee staff's lawyers have concluded that it is the vice president's voice.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Given the vice president's apparent location in the room, and the apparent location of Mr. Wiriadinata, it is a reasonable assumption that Vice President Gore was making this suggestion to Mr. Wiriadinata,'' Mr. Burton wrote today in a five-page letter on the subject to Attorney General Janet Reno. ''It would indeed be extraordinary for the vice president to suggest showing political issue advertisements to an Indonesian billionaire who lives in Jakarta, Indonesia.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The committee referred the videotape to the Justice Department last December, but Mr. Gore was not asked about it during his interview with federal investigators last April 19 or in four previous interviews.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A White House official said that, after listening to the tape, aides to Mr. Gore were not convinced that Mr. Riady's name was used by the vice president. ''People say the V.P. is using a two-syllable name, like Dotty or Godfrey, and not a five-syllable phrase like Mr. Riady,'' the official said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Earlier, the official suggested more definitively that Mr. Gore had used the name ''Godfrey'' during the remark. A Houston lawyer, Lee Godfrey, had attended the same coffee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In April, Mr. Gore told investigators that he had seen Mr. Riady only ''twice in my life.'' The first time was during a trip to Malaysia, and the second time was ''when he was in Betty Currie's office preparing to go in to see the president with a couple of other people.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Burton suggests seven questions for Ms. Reno's investigators to ask Mr. Gore about the incident. One of them is: ''If the vice president made a suggestion about showing tapes to Mr. Riady, what did he know about Mr. Riady that would lead him to make this suggestion in the presence of Mr. Wiriadinata?''

  Why Mr. Torricelli chose this time to enter the race is also up for debate, although he has been interested in the office for years. Those who have spoken to Mr. Torricelli say he is looking ahead to November and calculating that Vice President Al Gore will lose the presidential race.  That would make him eager to leave Washington and run for governor, they say. And, better to signal his interest now than to spring it on Mr. McGreevey and the rest of the party after the election results are in.

  Critics of Mr. Buchanan say his vision of the Reform Party would, in effect, pick up where the Christian Coalition left off, but his mission could receive substantial lifts in the months ahead. His efforts, for example, would no doubt be aided if Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the all-but-named Republican nominee, chose a running mate who favored abortion rights, alienating staunchly conservative Republicans.

  In addition, the amendment Mr. Gore proposes would give victims the right to be heard at sentencing, the right to be included in any public proceedings related to the crime, the right to restitution from a convicted offender and the right to a trial without unreasonable delay.
 </textdata>

  ''The accused criminals have all kinds of rights, and we all understand why that is important,'' Mr. Gore said. ''But here is the point: When those rights are enshrined in the Constitution and the rights of victims are not, whenever the two come into any kind of a conflict, it is not even a close contest. The victims are put in the back seat and sometimes even ignored.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The amendment, part of the victims' bill of rights that Mr. Gore proposed today, would allow victims to leave work to attend legal proceedings, much the way jurors are excused from work. Mr. Gore said his measure would cost $685 million over 10 years and would be paid for with money from the projected budget surplus.

  Senator Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican who, with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has sponsored such an amendment, said in a conference call with reporters today that Mr. Gore had ''been AWOL from this fight.''

 </date>
 <textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  The senator said the administration had insisted that the rights of criminals would never be ''subservient'' to the rights of victims. ''They basically said that in the case of a tie the defendant always had to win,'' Mr. Kyl said. ''It bothers me now that Al Gore is trying to use this politically and in a fraudulent way, because he's never been helpful.''

  Years ago, Mr. Gore supported another proposed constitutional amendment, the Equal Rights Amendment. He was not in Congress when that amendment was passed in 1972, but, after the states failed to ratify it, he did vote in 1983 for the amendment to be revived.

  ''I've always been very reluctant to support a constitutional amendment,'' Mr. Gore told the victims who were gathered here at Rhodes College today by the Gore campaign.

  Maybe the Republicans aren't in fact suggesting that we should forgo the chance of peace in the Middle East because it might force George W. Bush to cut taxes by only $1.26 trillion instead of $1.3 trillion. But they are, quite deliberately, encouraging American voters in the delusion that we are being excessively generous to the world. And in so doing they are indeed making a trade-off -- not the pretended trade-off of foreign aid for Social Security, but a very real trade-off of foreign lives for American votes.

  It was during this time that he first met President Bush, who was then United States delegate to the United Nations, and the encounter led to a lifelong friendship. Mr. Coverdell was a frequent visitor to Kennebunkport, Me., Mr. Bush's vacation home, despite his professed incompetence on the links and aboard a fishing boat.

  Gov. George W. Bush extolled the importance of fatherhood today, lamenting the prevalence of children growing up without the guidance of both parents and saying he would direct the federal government to spend more money to coax fathers toward responsibility.

  But part of Mr. Bush's prescription, allowing the money to go to groups that use religion in their efforts to unite fathers with their families, illustrated a philosophy that has raised questions about the separation of church and state.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush talked about this approach during a panel discussion at a private agency in Milwaukee, Faith Works, which incorporates religion into its efforts to rehabilitate fathers with drug and alcohol problems and guide them into schools and jobs.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Faith does work,'' Mr. Bush said in Milwaukee this morning, before he headed here for several campaign events. ''It's a powerful concept. It's not a government concept, by the way. It recognizes that there are powers greater than mankind.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also said that while the federal government should do its part to help finance such efforts it should recognize ''programs that exist in spite of government, that help people who may be coming out of prison, to help them find work, but also remind folks of the importance of being a dad.''
 </textdata>

  A description of Mr. Bush's proposed policy distributed by his campaign aides said that most of the money would be directed by the federal Department of Health and Human Services toward groups, including those affiliated with churches, that help low-income fathers find work and promote being responsible parents.

  Mr. Bush's proposal and the setting in which he unveiled it, an inner-city agency that serves many African-Americans, were intended to bolster his portrayal of himself as a different kind of Republican with special concern for underprivileged people.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000

 <textdata>
  The event also underscored the occasional exhortations by Mr. Bush, who considers himself a devout Christian, for Americans to rediscover the benefits of more traditional mores. So did the words of one of the other panelists.

  GORE TRAILS BUSH IN ARKANSAS  Bill Clinton and Al Gore carried Mr. Clinton's home state of Arkansas by comfortable margins in 1992 and 1996. But a new Mason-Dixon poll conducted for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette raises some doubts whether Mr. Gore can continue the streak. It has Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ahead 46 percent to 40 percent, with 11 percent undecided. ''A very disconcerting poll for Democrats,'' crowed Mr. Bush's Arkansas chairman, Senator Tim Hutchinson. Mr. Gore's chairman, state Attorney General Mark Pryor, countered: ''It's encouraging for Gore because most of the undecided voters will back him.'' The poll, conducted July 13 through 15, covered 622 likely voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

  ''I'm trying very hard not in any way to offend any of the Bush people or overshadow what is clearly Governor Bush's event,'' Mr. McCain said in an interview Monday at his Senate office, where he arrived illuminated by a CNN camera light.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Advisers to Gov. George W. Bush profess not to be offended in the slightest. They say that Mr. McCain's star power can now only benefit them, by drawing the attention of independent voters.
 </textdata>

  If there is to be any dissent at the convention, which begins on July 31, it is not likely to come from the scrappy Arizonan who used to say of Governor Bush that ''if he's a reformer, I'm an astronaut.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. McCain said that even when he appeared in Philadelphia on July 30 at a planned ''shadow convention,'' which will also feature antagonists of the right like the comedian Al Franken, he will promote Mr. Bush as devoted to ''reform of education, of the military, of our strategic posture nuclear-weapons-wise, health care, etc.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Though they have spoken a few times by telephone, Governor Bush and Senator McCain have not appeared together since May 9, when Mr. McCain endorsed his former opponent in Pittsburgh. But Mr. McCain said in the interview that he intends to campaign alongside Mr. Bush after the convention and again in September and October.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, Mr. McCain seemed at times less than thrilled with his bridesmaid's role. He looked down and spoke softly when asked to describe his level of enthusiasm for Mr. Bush's candidacy. ''My enthusiasm is very high,'' he said. In the interview, he became animated only when discussing the high points of his campaign, which he recalled with ''nostalgia and pleasure.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his subdued tones, Mr. McCain praised Mr. Bush as running ''an increasingly centrist campaign.''  From Mr. Bush's perspective, the benefits of comity are obvious. According to public polls, Mr. McCain remains more popular than Mr. Bush or Vice President Al Gore, as the senator's aides are quick to point out. He is particularly beloved by the swing groups of independent and undecided voters needed by both candidates. Representative Thomas M. Davis III, who is leading the Republican drive to retain the House, said that even party regulars clamor for  Mr. McCain. ''Now that he's no longer a threat, they've kind of embraced him,'' he said. ''He's everywhere from Florida to Mississippi to New Hampshire. He's the man.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McCain said that he wants comity because he is a loyal Republican. ''I was very concerned about, and should be concerned about, giving the appearance of being a bad loser,'' Mr. McCain said. ''I don't think that's helpful to me, to Governor Bush, or to the party. And frankly, I didn't want to be a bad loser.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000

 <textdata>
  After dropping out of the race, Mr. McCain formed a political action committee, Straight Talk America, to promote his agenda. He is creating a Center for Conservative Reform to add some intellectual heft to it. His aides acknowledge that the PAC could serve as the basis for a future presidential bid, should Mr. Bush stumble. But while Mr. McCain said, after a long pause, that he did not know if he would ever run for president again, he called the prospect unlikely. He said he did not want to be picked as vice president and did not expect to be.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McCain's aides studied how failed Republican nominees, including Ronald Reagan in 1976, approached the party's conventions. But they took more cues from the supportive role that Gen. Colin L. Powell played in 1996. After first receiving the go-ahead from the Bush camp, Andrew Card, the co-chairman of the convention, invited Mr. McCain to speak during a meeting on June 20. He said he told Mr. McCain that he was seeking ''political celebrities,'' not politicians.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McCain does not plan to deliver anything like the jeremiad at the 1992 convention by Patrick J. Buchanan, who rallied the party to religious and cultural ''war'' and helped sink the re-election bid of Mr. Bush's father. Mr. McCain's speech at 10:30 on the convention's second night, will be devoted to Mr. Bush's chosen theme, ''Strength and Security With a Purpose,'' and will probably not even mention the senator's signature issue, campaign finance reform, aides said. No one asked Mr. McCain to show his speech to the convention organizers ahead of time, according to all parties, but he plans to do so.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-19-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Card said that, while Mr. McCain's bus trip was not part of the plan for the convention, there was ''no danger'' of Mr. Bush's being upstaged. Mr. McCain will not even be in the audience when Mr. Bush accepts the nomination. He plans to leave on the convention's third day, Wednesday morning -- a sign not of pique, organizers and supporters insist, but of self-abnegation.

  BUSH PERE IN THE BACKGROUND  Gov. George W. Bush's wife, Laura, and his 24-year-old nephew, George P. Bush, will have featured roles at next week's Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. And George P.'s father, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, will be doing the rounds of television interview shows off the convention floor. But former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, the biggest Bush stars at the show other than the nominee, will remain mainly in the background, as they have throughout most of the campaign, with no speaking roles that might steal the limelight from their son. ''We want to be careful it doesn't turn into a Bush family reunion,'' one of the convention's co-chairmen, Andrew Card, said yesterday. Mr. Card said Laura Bush would speak to the convention on one of the early nights and that later in the week, George P. Bush and his Mexican-born mother, Columba, would have a featured role, mainly to underscore the work they have been doing in recent months to promote George W.'s candidacy among Hispanics and younger voters.

 </textdata>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  I have to admit something. I didn't pick Dick Cheney because of Wyoming's three electoral votes, although we're going to work hard to earn them. I picked him because he is without a doubt fully capable of being the president of the United States. And I picked him because he will be a valuable partner in a Bush administration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Well, this is obviously a very special moment for Lynne and me. Three months ago, when Governor Bush asked me to head up his search team I honestly did not expect that I would be standing here today.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When the governor first asked whether or not I would consider being a candidate, I respectfully declined. I was deeply involved in running a business, enjoying private life, and I certainly wasn't looking to return to public service. But I had an experience that changed my mind this spring. As I worked alongside Governor Bush I heard him talk about his unique vision for our party and for our nation. I saw his sincerity, I watched him make decisions, always firm and always fair. And in the end, I learned how persuasive he can be. So this morning when the governor called and asked me to join him as the vice-presidential nominee, I accepted with enthusiasm. . . .
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000

 <textdata>
  Governor Bush is seeking not only to win an election, but also to lead our nation. He's confronting the tough issues: strengthening Social Security and Medicare, reforming our public schools, cutting taxes and rebuilding America's military. He's shown an ability here in Texas to bring Republicans and Democrats together in the public interest. I've watched him put his compassionate conservative philosophy to work in this great state with tremendous results. He's proven himself a leader with consistency and conviction.

  As chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities during the Reagan and Bush administrations and later as a television, newspaper and magazine commentator, Mrs. Cheney has been a cultural warrior and darling of the right, accusing those she calls cultural relativists of taking over American art, literature and education.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, Mrs. Cheney is one of her party's most forceful figures, and some Republicans think she deserves a cabinet post in a new administration and even belonged on Mr. Bush's list of vice-presidential prospects.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Friends of Mrs. Cheney say she has made no secret about political ambitions of her own. Indeed, in introducing Mr. Cheney as his running mate today, Mr. Bush also singled her out, describing her as ''a leader in education reform in all America, developing high standards and a sound curriculum for our public schools.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After the Bush administration, she became a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, where she promoted her vision of a more wholesome, morally correct, educationally rigorous America. She also sometimes sat in the conservative chair on the CNN television program ''Crossfire,'' where she denounced what she described as declining cultural standards, especially in the schools.

  In the end, it was Gov. George W. Bush himself who did the final, most sensitive background check on the man who was supposed to be the one running the vice presidential screening process.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So just as Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary, had met with other finalists to go over questions about their personal lives and finances, Mr. Bush questioned Mr. Cheney. As Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's spokeswoman put it, ''In this case, Governor Bush served as the chair of the search committee.''

 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000

 <textdata>
  And that night he called Mr. Bush to tell him there was no reason why he could not accept the nomination.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet at the same time, he continued the search process, Ms. Hughes said, because he wanted to make sure Mr. Bush had other options.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's courtship of Mr. Cheney began in March, just after the Republican primaries had ended. Mr. Bush said he asked if Mr. Cheney would be willing to be considered as a running mate. ''At the time,'' Mr. Bush said today, ''he said no.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the interim, Mr. Bush sent out hundreds of letters to party leaders asking for their input. A list of vice-presidential finalists received detailed questionnaires asking about their health, their finances, their voting records, their military records.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The questionnaires came back to the campaign. But this month once again, Mr. Bush circled back to Mr. Cheney. It was the Fourth of July weekend, and the two men were reviewing options at Mr. Bush's ranch.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After lunch, the two men walked out to the back porch and once again Mr. Bush asked Mr. Cheney whether he would be willing to be considered.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I was impressed,'' Mr. Bush said today, ''by the thoughtful and thorough way he approached his mission. And gradually I realized that the person who was best qualified to be my vice-presidential nominee was working by my side.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, the search continued. That week Mr. Bush discussed the vice presidency with Gov. George E. Pataki of New York on a campaign trip into New Jersey and New York.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A day later, on July 15, Mr. Bush summoned his three top aides -- Ms. Hughes, Karl Rove and Joe Allbaugh -- to meet with him, his wife, Laura, and Mr. Cheney. ''We talked through the ramifications of the leader of the search becoming a potential candidate in that search,'' Ms. Hughes said. Mr. Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, declined today to spell out the considerations but said, ''Obviously, they were not grave.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides said Mr. Cheney's past was not unknown territory. Mr. Cheney, who had a long government career, had been screened by the F.B.I. three times and had undergone Senate confirmation hearings. As defense secretary under former President Bush, he had held the nation's highest security clearance.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush decided he wanted an independent review of Mr. Cheney's health. He called his father, the former President, and asked him to ask his friend the noted Houston heart surgeon, Denton A. Cooley, to speak to Mr. Cheney's doctors.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On July 18, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney met with another of the vice-presidential contenders, John C. Danforth, a former senator from Missouri, and his wife.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Hughes said Mr. Bush himself at some point talked with Mr. Cheney about his personal and financial background, but she did not provide further detail. Since leaving his defense post, Mr. Cheney has been the chief executive officer of the Halliburton Company, a worldwide oil field services company that has paid him millions of dollars in salary and stock options.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There are signs that Mr. Bush's father was taking an interest in the search, and a specific interest in Mr. Cheney. Ms. Hughes today described the former president's role as ''that of a loving father,'' ready to lend an ear to his son. Asked if the former president supported Mr. Cheney above all candidates, she said she was ''sure he spoke highly of several of them.'' She said she did not know whether he had personally called Mr. Cheney to lobby him.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000

  This morning, Mr. Bush called Mr. Cheney at his home in Dallas and asked him to be his running mate. Hours later they stood together here in Austin before a crowd waving red white and blue pompoms.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''In the end,'' Mr. Cheney said of Mr. Bush, ''I learned how persuasive he can be.''

  Bush Names Cheney As G.O.P. Running Mate  Gov. George W. Bush formally introduced Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary and a longtime family friend, as his choice for vice president, praising Mr. Cheney, 59, as a man of ''great integrity, sound judgment and experience.''

  Rather than decide on full-scale deployment, Mr. Clinton will limit his decision to whether to begin construction next spring of a radar station on Shemya island in Alaska, Mr. Cohen said. That would leave it to the next president to determine the scope of the project, he said. Vice President Gore generally supports the Clinton approach, while George W. Bush, the presumed Republican candidate, favors a more robust system.

  The Cheney choice is about the past. But then, W.'s campaign has always been less about vision than vindication. The dauphin must reclaim the throne because the Bushes must restore the halcyon days of the ruling-class court that thrived before that dissolute commoner Bill Clinton usurped it.

  I doubt either Bush would have felt comfortable running with a woman. Or with anyone who challenged their egos or made waves, like John McCain. They need a history of loyalty, and they have a preference for deference. Dick Cheney is one of their guys, in the Club. And they know best.

  Because he never served in Congress, Gov. George W. Bush does not have a voting record. But he acquired one yesterday with the selection of Richard B. Cheney as his running mate. Republicans were cheering the sound judgment and broad foreign policy experience that Mr. Cheney, a former secretary of defense and White House chief of staff, brings to the Republican ticket. But Democrats were eyeing the hard-line conservative votes that Mr. Cheney cast during a 10-year House career. From Vice President Al Gore's perspective, Mr. Cheney adds weight to the G.O.P. ticket, but he also opens up promising lanes of attack.

  Mr. Bush believes that his running mate brings a resume and a personality that will outweigh any ideological vulnerability. Indeed, Mr. Cheney's vaunted toughness comes wrapped in a genial, Nebraska-born, Wyoming-honed personal manner. His deep experience clearly allows Mr. Bush to argue that he has passed a threshold test for any presidential candidate by picking a partner who would make a plausible successor. On that score, Governor Bush did a much better job than his father did in 1988 by choosing Dan Quayle.

  Still, Mr. Cheney's competence cannot soften a stark legislative record. Several times in his Congressional career he got a 100 percent favorable rating from the American Conservative Union and zero from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action. He was consistently pro-life, and his opposition to abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, will help Mr. Gore argue that the Bush-Cheney ticket represents a threat to women's right to choose. Mr. Cheney also voted against gun control legislation that came his way, including a bill regulating cop-killer bullets that many other conservatives backed.

  Mr. Cheney's environmental views will also be a tempting target for Mr. Gore. Mr. Cheney was among the few who voted not to override President Reagan's veto of a Clean Water Act reauthorization in 1987. Then as now, he supported opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, a talismanic issue among conservationists. He is also on record as opposing the Kyoto agreement on global warming, which Mr. Gore helped to negotiate, as a potential threat to America's national security.

  While Mr. Cheney never demonstrated the mean streak associated with Newt Gingrich conservatives, his selection indisputably pulls the Republican ticket to the right. This comes after several weeks when it appeared that Mr. Bush would pick a Northeasterner like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania to put his party nearer the political center. Now it will be up to Mr. Bush himself to pull in the moderate voters he will need to carry swing states outside his Southern and Western base.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That positioning exercise may not be easy, especially with Mr. Gore sniping away. A New York Times/CBS poll yesterday suggested that the public, which in February divided equally between ''conservative'' and ''moderate'' when asked to describe Mr. Bush's ideology, now increasingly regards the Texas governor as a conservative. Mr. Cheney's selection is sure to reinforce that impression.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the days ahead, Mr. Cheney will be marketed as someone who brings sound judgment and safe hands to the executive branch. That is a reasonable depiction. By virtue of experience and temperament, he does represent a responsible choice. But the voters will also be asked to factor ideology into their selection this fall. And Mr. Gore, waving a long list of House votes, will not allow Mr. Bush's picture of Dick Cheney to go unchallenged.

  In choosing Mr. Cheney as his running mate, Gov. George W. Bush has turned to an unflappable Washington insider whose easygoing exterior masks a steely confidence, a man who, once he makes a tough decision, never looks back.

  Mr. Cheney, 59, who served 10 years in the House of Representatives and four as President George Bush's defense secretary, brings stature, decisiveness and decades of government experience to a campaign sometimes short on all three.

  He is an Ivy League dropout who  became a doctoral student in political science. He was the No. 2 House Republican on the path to possibly becoming speaker when President Bush plucked him from Congress to run the Pentagon after the Senate rejected his first choice, Senator John Tower of Texas. He was a military neophyte, avoiding the Vietnam War with student and parent deferments, who steeped himself in military tactics and doctrine and became the most pivotal defense secretary since Robert S. McNamara.

  When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, it was Mr. Cheney who flew to Saudi Arabia to present King Fahd with President Bush's offer to send up to 200,000 American troops to the kingdom. He clashed with General Powell, who recommended keeping economic sanctions in place longer, and prodded the military to plan a larger, more ambitious counterattack against Iraqi forces.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even General Powell, a close ally, was not above reproach. General Powell recalled in his memoirs that after one meeting with President Bush during the gulf crisis, Mr. Cheney pulled him aside. '' 'Colin,' he said, 'You're chairman of the Joint Chiefs. You're not secretary of state. You're not the national security adviser anymore. And you're not secretary of defense. So stick to military matters.' He made it clear that I had taken liberty for license.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, discretion is a Cheney byword. When President Bush met with his foreign policy advisers during the gulf crisis, Mr. Baker and General Powell typically briefed their senior aides afterward. Not Mr. Cheney.

  As chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities during the Reagan and Bush administrations and later as a commentator, Mrs. Cheney has been a cultural warrior and darling of the right, accusting those she calls cultural relativists of taking over American art, literature and education.

  Friends of Mrs. Cheney say she has made no secret about political ambitions of her own. Indeed, in introducing Mr. Cheney as his running mate today, Mr. Bush also singled her out, describing her as ''a leader in education reform in all America, developing high standards and a sound curriculum for our public schools.''

 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cheney had been tapped by Mr. Bush to supervise that process in late April. But over the ensuing weeks and months, Mr. Bush said, ''I benefited from his keen insight. I was impressed by the thoughtful and thorough way he approached his mission. And gradually I realized that the person who was best qualified to be my vice-presidential nominee was working by my side.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  When Mr. Cheney took Mr. Bush's place at a lectern set up in front of a row of 30 American flags, his remarks -- only half as long as the governor's -- suggested that Mr. Bush had found a No. 2 with precisely the kind of loyalty that the governor had always said he wanted.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I enthusiastically accept the challenge,'' he told Mr. Bush, ''for this reason: I believe you have the vision and the courage to be a great president. And I want to do absolutely everything I can to make certain that happens.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000

 <textdata>
  Though it had been clear for days that Mr. Cheney would almost certainly be the governor's choice, their joint appearance in a large meeting room here today marked the first formal acknowledgement by the Bush campaign that Bush-Cheney was the ticket with which the Republican Party would try to win the White House. The two men's wives, Laura Bush and Lynne Cheney, shared a modest stage with them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In turning to Mr. Cheney, Mr. Bush chose someone whose extremely conservative record from 1979 to 1989, when he represented Wyoming in Congress and reliably cast votes against abortion rights and gun control, was sure to provide Democrats and liberal interest groups with fodder for their assertions that a Bush presidency would tilt sharply toward the right.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The selection also raised questions about how Mr. Cheney, who was entrusted with the task of screening other potential vice-presidential nominees, was put through the process himself. Karen P. Hughes, the director of communications for the Bush campaign, said today that Mr. Bush had taken on at least part of that chore, subjecting Mr. Cheney to the sort of questions about finances and other personal information that Mr. Cheney had asked other contenders.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush appeared to accomplish several goals at once by picking Mr. Cheney. He supplemented his own limited career in government, confined to the five and a half years that he has presided over the nation's second-largest state, with the accumulated wisdom of a man who served as chief of staff under President Gerald R. Ford and then spent a decade in the House before his appointment as the defense secretary by President George Bush, the governor's father.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And because the selection of Mr. Cheney did not on its face represent an overtly political calculation, it enabled Mr. Bush to maintain his assertion that he is someone more interested in good government than political gamesmanship, someone more deeply wedded to principles than to polls. There was no discernible electoral strategy at work: Mr. Cheney maintains homes in Texas and Wyoming, two states that Mr. Bush should easily win in November.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some of the remarks that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney made today amounted to a preview of that pitch.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Governor Bush is seeking not only to win an election, but also to lead our nation,'' Mr. Cheney said in a voice that was softer, deeper and steadier than Mr. Bush's.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Minutes earlier, Mr. Bush had said, ''I have to admit something. I didn't pick Dick Cheney because of Wyoming's three electoral votes, although we're going to work hard to earn them. I picked him because he is without a doubt fully capable of being the president of the United States. And I picked him because he will be a valuable partner in a Bush administration.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The word ''partner'' suggested something else Mr. Bush had been looking for: someone with whom he felt a strong sense of comfort and an equally strong sense of trust. Mr. Cheney clearly fit that bill, partly because of his history with Mr. Bush's father, partly because he helped the governor assemble a team of foreign policy advisers last year, then got to know Mr. Bush even better in the last three months.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He's obviously family-tested -- loyal all the way back,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a historian who teaches courses on the presidency at the University of Texas and has closely followed Mr. Bush's career. ''He's comfortable. They've developed a relationship as a consequence of this search process.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Professor Buchanan suggested that Mr. Cheney could also help fill any deficit of substance that voters might perceive in Mr. Bush. ''It's in keeping with the great pains that he has taken all along to build a shadow government that's made up of people who quiet the fears that he's shallow and out of his depth,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many prominent Republicans sold the selection a different way: as evidence that Mr. Bush, 54, was so secure in his own abilities and confident in his own leadership that he would recruit a teammate like Mr. Cheney, 59, who looks at least 10 years older than the governor and has a much longer political resume. Alternately, Republicans said Mr. Cheney's selection was proof that Mr. Bush was earnestly filling in the gaps in his own experience.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In fact, Mr. Lott added, he told Mr. Cheney several months ago that he would be the best choice for Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Senator John McCain of Arizona, whom many House Republicans had promoted for a place on the Bush ticket, said today that Mr. Cheney's ''leadership skills are proven in many areas.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At least a few other Republicans were left scratching their heads. They questioned why Mr. Bush, who has voted to expand the party's appeal and bring a fresh perspective to Washington, would pick a running mate with such conservative bearings and such strong ties to the Republican establishment of the past.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And they questioned why Mr. Bush, long eager to emerge from his father's shadow, would summon it anew with the choice of someone from his father's cabinet.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another Republican strategist said: ''For all the running away he's done from his father, now he's Velcroed himself to the old man. It's the old Bush. It's just unfortunate. The Democrats are gloating.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Hughes said today that the only active role former President Bush had played in the process, other than as a sounding board for his son, was to call Dr. Denton Cooley, a prominent cardiac surgeon who is a family friend, and ask him for his opinion on Mr. Cheney's health. Mr. Cheney suffered three mild heart attacks more than a decade ago and had bypass surgery in 1988.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's advisers moved quickly today to dispel any doubts about Mr. Cheney's physical fitness for the long road to November, and possibly beyond. The Bush campaign released letters from Mr. Cheney's doctors at George Washington University that provided a detailed synopsis of his medical history.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At a news conference after Mr. Bush's introduction of Mr. Cheney, Ms. Hughes was even able to answer a question about the specific food allergy mentioned in one of these reports. The allergy was to pomegranates, she said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Hughes also made a point of mentioning that when Mr. Bush, at home in the governor's mansion this morning, called Mr. Cheney's house in Dallas to offer him a place on the Republican ticket, Mr. Cheney was exercising on his treadmill.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney did not take questions from reporters, instead sticking to the statements they had prepared. But Mr. Cheney appeared on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' tonight to give his first interview as Mr. Bush's running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said the role he would play in a new, second Bush administration would be that of a frank but discreet adviser. ''He very much values people who level with him, who tell him exactly what they think,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''I'm most effective when I'm able to speak my piece, but also when I do it privately.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said he had found a real chemistry with Mr. Bush, and earlier in the day he, Mr. Bush and Ms. Hughes had provided some details about the evolution of the relationship between the two men.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  According to these accounts, Mr. Bush had asked Mr. Cheney in March, right after the governor effectively secured his party's presidential nomination, if he would be willing to be considered for the vice presidential nomination. Mr. Cheney said no.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But about three weeks ago, Ms. Hughes said, Mr. Bush asked Mr. Cheney again, and drew a different response.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This time,'' Mr. Bush said, ''he said he was willing to talk with his family and consider it.'' He smiled broadly, and Mr. Cheney reached over to his wife, Lynne, patted her on the shoulder, then held a pair of crossed fingers in the air. The crowd of about 200 supporters and friends of Mr. Bush laughed loudly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cheney provided an unusual physical counterpoint to Mr. Bush, whose facial expression and demeanor conveyed an almost boyish excitement. Mr. Cheney, by contrast, seemed to be trying to hide his grin. He often cast his eyes downward and could not decide what to do with his hands, which were alternately deep in his pockets or clasped modestly in front of him.

  Both Gov. George W.

  The selection of Dick Cheney was deeply revealing about Mr. Bush's approach to politics and to governing. It underscored that Mr. Bush is generally not a bold risk taker in his public life. He is so confident that he will win the election (too confident, some Republicans say) that he was looking more for a partner who could help him in the White House than on the stump. He wanted someone beside him who is utterly loyal, and with whom he is comfortable.

He wanted someone beside him who is utterly loyal, and with whom he is comfortable.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And his decision suggests that Mr. Bush would be a president who, despite his own lack of seasoning on the national stage, is not afraid to surround himself with more experienced hands.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cheney brings so few obvious  political advantages to the ticket that it is clear that Mr. Bush determined that whatever may win him the White House, it would not be whom he picked as his No. 2.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even though his decision has dribbled out over the past few days, Mr. Bush's choice had been so unexpected that as recently a week ago, virtually every prominent Republican insider was tossing out names like Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Senator John McCain of Arizona, former Senator John Danforth of Missouri and -- everyone's favorite -- Gen. Colin L. Powell.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Though Mr. Bush made no secret of his attraction to General Powell, his calculation was that a choice with more sizzle (and with potential liabilities) was not worth the gamble to his election -- or to his happiness in the Oval Office. Even as Democrats were gleefully digging out Mr. Cheney's conservative voting record in Congress, Bush advisers said they were confident he would never embarrass the ticket. Mr. Bush also passed up an opportunity to try to break the Republican Party's abortion barrier by daring to go with a supporter of abortion rights, like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania or Gov. George E. Pataki of New York.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This less ambitious objective of Mr. Bush was settling on a No. 2 who passes what Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, calls the John Rocker test.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's play-it-safe approach may well have stemmed from a determination not to repeat mistakes of the past, namely his father's selection of Dan Quayle. Again and again, his advisers said over recent months that Mr. Bush was insistent less on bringing added value to the ticket and more on not doing anything to  hurt it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Cheney stood placidly next to Mr. Bush, his hands clasped in front of him. The newly burnished ticket did not even partake in the customary overhead victory clasp. The presidential candidate who is derided by critics as being so unpresidential picked a partner whose presence practically shouts: grown-up.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It was a far cry from 1988 when Mr. Quayle, looking very much like George Bush's son, bounced around the stage in Huntington, Ind., appearing so grateful to be picked that he could not contain himself.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But while nothing went awry yesterday, it was hardly a rousing debut. It did not approach the energetic tableau eight years ago in Little Rock, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore and their families joined for one of that campaign's most memorable moments. There is no chance that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney will be dubbed the ''hunks of the heartland,'' as were Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, many Republicans were jubilant yesterday that Mr. Bush had found a running mate who would not lead delegates at next week's Republican convention to utter the dreaded ''A word'': abortion. Mr. Cheney is, safely, an abortion foe. He is also, safely, conservative, but one who gets on well with moderates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's lack of interest in a political quick fix that might play well in a particular state or satisfy certain constituencies also shows that he is mindful of history. The last vice-presidential candidate who actually made a difference in the outcome was 40 years ago, when John F. Kennedy picked Lyndon B. Johnson, who assured him that he would carry Texas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Cheney pick is not devoid of political upsides -- or risks. Mr. Cheney's vast experience in Congress, in the White House and in national security issues will help counter critiques from the Democrats that Mr. Bush is not ready for the White House. While General Powell was not available, it could be that Mr. Bush saw the next best thing in Mr. Cheney, who was also a mainstay of the Persian Gulf war, his father's greatest triumph.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In introducing Mr. Cheney, Mr. Bush, in fact, sought to score points for picking a partner for reasons that did not appear baldly political. ''I have to admit something,'' he said. ''I didn't pick Dick Cheney because of Wyoming's three electoral votes.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Safe it may seem, but not foolproof. One of Mr. Bush's prime advantages over Vice President Al Gore is that he does not have a long trail of Congressional votes to be mined by the opposition. Mr. Cheney does -- and many of his votes are decidedly conservative. For all the stature he brings, Mr. Cheney, who is close to former President George Bush, could suggest to voters that Governor Bush is a daddy's boy. Even with his doctor's stamp of approval, Mr. Cheney's history of three heart attacks is hardly reassuring to some people.

  The 240-page report, a copy of which was made available by an administration official, seems timed to help Vice President Al Gore shore up political support from steel workers and unions. Some union leaders sharply criticized Mr. Gore's support for the China trade bill this year, and many have expressed disappointment that the administration has not done more to guard against sudden increases in low-price steel imports.

  Mr. Gore met with Warren Christopher, the chairman of his search committee, at Mr. Gore's residence here last night and this morning. The vice president's every move is being examined for its implications in the selection of a running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This morning, Mr. Gore described the meeting as part of his effort to maintain a dignified process..
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore told reporters that he was down to a short list but did not want to divulge any names.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, Mr. Gore has managed to bump into several of his prospects along the campaign trail. He attended a fund-raising reception tonight at the Virginia home of Mr. Kerry. On Sunday, he met with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut at the Manhattan apartment of the singer Paul Simon. He begins a vacation on Thursday in North Carolina on an island that is home to Mr. Edwards. Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana will be vacationing nearby.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Mr. Gore had to cancel his appearance at a dinner in Nashville last week, he asked Senator Bob Graham of Florida to fill in. After Mr. Christopher met with Mr. Gore this morning, he met with Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Harkin would not say whether the 40-minute visit focused on his selection or someone else's. The senator, who has met with Mr. Christopher before, could help Mr. Gore with organized labor, farmers and the liberal wing of his party, but at 61, he could be perceived as part of the past and not the future.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Amid the names, and with Mr. Bush's selection of Mr. Cheney, talk of former Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine has died down. If Mr. Bush had picked a relative newcomer, like Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Mr. Gore might have felt the need to pick an older voice of experience, like Mr. Mitchell.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But supporters believe that Mr. Gore already has the experience that Mr. Bush had to seek in a running mate, and some say that frees him to pick someone with a young and vigorous image.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, called Mr. Cheney a ''retro'' choice, indicating that Mr. Gore wanted someone who speaks to the future. Chris Lehane, also a Gore spokesman, said the selection underscored that ''this really is your father's Republican Party.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If Mr. Bush had picked a woman, or someone who could have helped the Republicans win a critical state, Mr. Gore might have felt pressured to pick someone with the same appeal. Some in the Gore camp were worried that Mr. Bush would pick either Senator John McCain of Arizona or Gen. Colin L. Powell, both of whom might have electrified voters in a way that would have been difficult for Mr. Gore to counter.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As it is, those close to the Gore campaign said, the choice of an older white man who brings little charisma to the ticket and whose home state of Wyoming was already in the Republican column, means that Mr. Gore does not have to match a particular quality or region or find a political superstar.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Allan J. Lichtman, a specialist on presidential politics at American University, said: ''This gives Gore an absolute free shot, politically. It puts no pressure on him.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Gore campaign is retreating from its earlier consideration of trying to cut into Mr. Bush's ''bounce'' from the Republican convention by announcing the Democratic running mate shortly after the Republicans leave Philadelphia.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Instead, one possibility was to set a date the following week in which Mr. Gore would announce his choice, a process that advisers said would bring more dignity to the selection.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-26-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988, said in an interview that the choice of Mr. Cheney ''should not make one particle of difference'' for Mr. Gore. Whatever Mr. Bush's choice, Mr. Dukakis said, Mr. Gore is still under obligation to pick someone who could step into the job of president.

  ''It would be a misinterpretation of this paper to say, 'There's a genius spot in the brain,' '' said Dr. Marie T. Banich, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Dr. Robert J. Sternberg, a psychologist at Yale University who wrote a ''Perspectives'' essay to accompany the new study, said in an interview: ''This is a very narrow view of intelligence. Many psychologists are obsessed with I.Q.-type tests, but such tests don't tell you who is going to be successful in life and who isn't.'' He pointed out in his Perspectives piece that Vice President Al Gore, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and former Senator Bill Bradley all scored just middling-well on the verbal portion of the College Boards, yet all, he said, would be considered exceptionally successful Americans.

  Mr. Gore also confronted head on the common assumption, backed up in polls, that voters prefer Mr. Bush's personality, warning that the presidency was not a ''popularity contest.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  ''I understand that Governor Bush is a popular and well-liked governor here, and I want to give him some credit on that score,'' Mr. Gore told a hastily arranged forum of a dozen adults, including Democratic state legislators, three single mothers and a few squirming children.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I think he has a warm and engaging personality but, you know, the presidency is more than just a popularity contest,'' Mr. Gore went on. ''It involves whether or not you're willing to fight for what's right, whether or not you're willing to spend popularity to do difficult, hard things. And that's where you get to priorities.''

  Mr. Gore diverted his campaign to Texas today to try to take advantage of questions emerging about the state budget, which has $610 million in cost overruns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign, which called Mr. Gore's visit a gimmick, said the vice president was raising more questions about his own credibility than he was about the stewardship of Texas, accusing him of distorting the budget situation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000

 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  But in prepared remarks that were never delivered, Mr. Bush took a tougher line.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I am disappointed that the vice president of all the United States would come to one of those states and try to mislead people about its budget,'' his statement said. ''Our Texas budget is balanced and in the black. We have a surplus of $1.4 billion in the bank. For Vice President Gore to claim otherwise for his own political purposes is a travesty -- he should be ashamed.''

  Dan Bartlett a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Gore's chief distortion was painting a $1.7 billion tax cut pushed by Mr. Bush and his allies as a special break for the oil industry. Mr. Bartlett said that the oil industry's share amounted to just $20 million, and that most of the tax break had been applied to reducing school property taxes.

  Mr. Gore said the central question was one of priorities. His press secretary, Chris Lehane, said Mr. Bush's priorities ''raise questions about whether he has what it takes to be president.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This was a theme that Mr. Gore had tried out earlier this spring but dropped when advisers said it was too early to be so negative. It still seemed the major risk today for Mr. Gore, which is why he opened his remarks with a nod to Mr. Bush's congeniality, Gore supporters acknowledged. Still, his advisers said this would become a central theme as the campaign developed.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  For his setting today, Mr. Gore chose a hotel on the outskirts of town, nailing down the details about midnight the night before.

  His format was intimate: people  sat on chairs and a couch next to Mr. Gore, who was facing a bank of cameras, including those of CNN, which broadcast the event live. On the blue-curtained backdrop, aides had pinned Lone Star flags, suggesting that the vice president was staking a claim in the heart of Bush territory.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Whether Mr. Gore changes the minds of many Texans remains to be seen, but they were not really the audience today. At the moment, nearly three-fourths of the state's voters say they support Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gore aides conceded that today's event was aimed chiefly at voters beyond Texas, particularly swing voters, women and core Democrats who may find the governor an appealing figure, but who would be offended at what Mr. Gore tried to portray as Mr. Bush's disregard for health care, children and the environment.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If a state finds ways to discourage families from signing up for CHIP, the state saves money in its budget,'' Mr. Gore said, referring to the government Children's Health Insurance Program. ''If they create obstacles, and families get the idea they shouldn't participate, the state can use the money for other things, like a tax break for the oil companies.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bartlett, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said Mr. Gore was blurring the line between Medicaid and the health insurance program. He said that applications for the children's health program were simple and could be mailed in. Mr. Bartlett also said that, contrary to Mr. Gore's assertion, Texas was one of 12 states, not the only one, that required people to reapply every six months for Medicaid.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As for Mr. Gore's comments on Mr. Bush's personality, Mr. Bartlett said: ''This contest is going to be, 'Who do the American people trust with their money and their priorities?' And if we're going to base this on the fiscal stewardship of Texas compared to the lack of Al Gore's credibility, we relish the fight.''

  Mr. Gore even came to Texas today to continue the criticism, questioning Mr. Bush's handling of the state budget and his priorities as governor.

  ''Texas isn't nearly as backward and third world as the Gore campaign would make us out,'' protested Michael Levy, the publisher of Texas Monthly magazine. ''I personally am starting to get offended.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Last week Mr. Levy and four other Texans, none of them unfamiliar with politics or publicity, declared themselves the Proud of Texas Committee. They wrote to Mr. Gore, pledging to defend the honor of their state against his ''misrepresentations.'' In another era, that might have involved pistols; in modern Texas, a news release sufficed. (The release neglected to mention, however, that four of the committee's five members are campaign contributors to Governor Bush, a fact Democratic officials happily pointed out.)

  Because below-average immunization rates in Houston and elsewhere made Texas ''ripe for epidemic'' -- a playful political swipe that angered local health officials. (In reply, Bush campaign aides noted that Houston's mayor, Lee Brown, is a Democrat and a Gore supporter.)

  Campaigning across the country, Mr. Gore regularly blames Mr. Bush for statistics that show Texas leads the nation in many pollution categories, has one of the highest numbers of children lacking health insurance and still lags in many national education rankings. In recent days, with state spending overruns causing headlines here, Mr. Gore has denounced Texas' fiscal ''mess.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If Governor Bush ran America the way he has run the state of Texas, our prosperity would vanish and our progress would be blocked,'' Mr. Gore said in San Antonio today at a meeting with parents of children who have no health insurance.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and his staff have aggressively contested Mr. Gore's attacks, accusing him of misrepresenting some facts and taking others out of context. They say that pollution has declined during the five and a half years of the Bush administration and that the state is doing more to insure poor children. They point to national studies showing educational gains in the state, and fiercely rebut Mr. Gore's fiscal criticism, noting that the state today announced a budget surplus.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Gore does have some admirers in Texas, and they maintain that regardless of any bruised feelings, the criticism is unavoidable and necessary. ''It's one thing to have your own family point out that you have an ugly house, it's another to have someone else say it,'' said Jim Hightower, the liberal Democrat and former state agriculture commissioner who now writes books and is host of a radio talk show. ''But there it is. It seems to me that we're not in a very good position to whine about what Gore is saying.''

  Mr. Gore, of course, is not indulging in a radical new political tactic. In fact, his role model could well be Mr. Bush's father. In 1988, Vice President George Bush toured Boston Harbor to harangue his Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, about pollution.

  And in 1992, when Mr. Bush, as president, belittled Bill Clinton's Arkansas as a ''small state,'' Ross Perot, the Reform Party's nominee and himself a Texan, found the theme hard to resist. ''I could say that I ran a small grocery store on the corner,'' Mr. Perot offered as an analogy. ''Therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I could run Wal-Mart. That's not true.''

  BRADLEY TO CAMPAIGN IN HOMETOWN  Former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey will campaign in his hometown of Crystal City, Mo., on Saturday with Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat who is trying to unseat Senator John Ashcroft, a one-term Republican, in one of the year's hardest-fought Congressional races. The event will be part of a four-day, 22-stop train tour across Missouri by Mr. Carnahan that is intended to recreate the 1948 whistle-stop tours around America by another Missourian, President Harry S. Truman. Mr. Bradley will be campaigning for just the second time since he dropped out of the Democratic presidential primaries in March; last week, he endorsed Vice President Al Gore in Wisconsin. Although Mr. Bradley lost the Missouri primary to Mr. Gore, he remains wildly popular in Crystal City, the small town on the Mississippi River where he kicked off his presidential campaign last year.

  BUSH LEAD SLIPS IN OHIO  Gov. George W. Bush has lost some ground to Vice President Al Gore in Ohio, considered a swing state in the fall election, a new poll shows. The poll, released yesterday by the University of Cincinnati's Institute for Policy Research, has Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore by four points in a two-candidate field, 49 percent to 45 percent, and by six points, 47 percent to 41 percent, in a four-candidate field that includes Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party. In April, a poll by the institute gave Mr. Bush a nine-point lead over Mr. Gore in a two-candidate race and an eight-point lead when Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Nader were included. In both polls the third-party candidates had 4 percent or less. The new poll, which surveyed 537 likely voters from July 5 to 13 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, also found that roughly a third of Bush and Gore supporters might switch their vote to another candidate before Nov. 7.

  Last week Mr. Levy and four other Texans, none of them unfamiliar with politics or publicity, declared themselves the Proud of Texas Committee. They wrote to Mr. Gore, pledging to defend the honor of their state against his ''misrepresentations.'' In another era, that might have involved pistols; in modern Texas, a news release sufficed. (The release neglected to mention, however, that four of the committee's five members are campaign contributors to Governor Bush, a fact Democratic officials happily pointed out.)

  Campaigning across the country, Mr. Gore regularly blames Mr. Bush for statistics that show Texas leads the nation in many pollution categories, has one of the highest numbers of children lacking health insurance and still lags in many national education rankings. In recent days, with state spending overruns causing headlines here, Mr. Gore has denounced Texas' fiscal ''mess.''

  ''If Governor Bush ran America the way he has run the state of Texas, our prosperity would vanish and our progress would be blocked,'' Mr. Gore said in San Antonio today at a meeting with parents of children who have no health insurance.

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and his staff have aggressively contested Mr. Gore's attacks, accusing him of misrepresenting some facts and taking others out of context. They say that pollution has declined during the five and a half years of the Bush administration and that the state is doing more to insure poor children. They point to national studies showing educational gains in the state, and fiercely rebut Mr. Gore's fiscal criticism, noting that the state today announced a budget surplus.

  At a first glance of the electoral map, opinion polls show Mr. Bush is leading in enough states to assure him an electoral college victory. But in many of those states, the governor's margin is quite slim. Moreover, Election Day is more than three months off, and the contest is entering a crucial phase where the choice of running mates and the message the conventions deliver could define the race.

  An analysis of opinion polls state by state, along with interviews with Republican and Democratic strategists in the campaigns and around the country, found enough crucial states that are so competitive that those midsummer events, and the fall debates to follow, could overturn the current standings in state after state. Or they could solidify Mr. Bush's position.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For all the emphasis in the news media on national polls, where Mr. Bush has maintained long-standing but narrowing leads, both campaigns are paying closer attention to the outlook in individual states, because the goal for each side is to plot a path to collect the 270 electoral votes needed for victory.

  On Wednesday, Mr. Gore's top lieutenants held a conference call to make important decisions about which states they should pump more resources into -- or not. Gore campaign officials said they had decided, for instance, not to spend as much in Illinois as they had planned because they felt confident in Mr. Gore's prospects there.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Just the same, one Bush campaign official said that Mr. Bush was doing better than he expected in Arizona, Colorado and Montana and, as a result, the campaign could scale back its spending in those states.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The state-by-state analysis shows that Mr. Gore is most potent along the coasts, while Mr. Bush has an inland foundation in the South and mountain states. That leaves the race to turn on several states in the industrial Midwest.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For now, Mr. Bush appears safe in 18 states with 140 electoral votes, from Texas to Alaska to Virginia. Another 11 states, including Florida, Michigan and Oregon -- with a combined 138 electoral votes -- seem to be leaning his way, though many of them could easily change quickly. If all these states went for Mr. Bush, it would give him 278 electoral votes, 8  more than needed for election.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the face of it, if Mr. Bush won all the states that are safe or lean his way, with a total of 278 electoral votes, he could win without taking any of the tossups. But while many more states are leaning toward Mr. Bush, polls and politicians agree that in several important states, the governor is barely ahead. It would not take a shift of too many voters to deny him Ohio, Missouri and Florida, and then his total would drop precipitously, to 221 electors.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Neither campaign agrees with this analysis. The Bush camp still insists that the Governor is comfortably ahead. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said in an interview that Mr. Gore had made some progress in drawing support from Democrats who had been reluctant to support him. But he said there was no sign that he was pulling any support from Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Republicans have also been encouraged that Mr. Nader has siphoned some support from Mr. Gore in several states, and by Mr. Bush's strength in some historical Democratic pockets, like Minnesota. The race there is a tossup.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  William M. Daley, chairman of the Gore campaign, disputed the idea of even a tentative Bush advantage. ''I think it's basically a dead heat, basically where it's been for months,'' Mr. Daley said. ''People aren't into it. There's a whole slew of states out there because people aren't focused. Nothing has grabbed them yet.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000

 <textdata>
  Richard Graber, the chairman of the Republican Party in Wisconsin, marveled at polls in his state showing Mr. Bush slightly ahead. ''There is a different energy and a different feel from what we had four years ago,'' Mr. Graber said. ''We were written off very early in the process. There was no money in this state. There was no TV. It was really free ride for Clinton. That's not the case'' this year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The competitiveness of Wisconsin helped explain why that is one of 26 states Mr. Bush has campaigned in since May. Candidates spend very little time in states they expect to lose. Mr. Gore has popped up in Indiana, for example, not once since May, or about as often as Mr. Bush has traveled to Massachusetts (once).
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Sometimes candidates take an occasional tactical foray designed to befuddle the opposition. Mr. Gore traveled to Mr. Bush's state of Texas today not because he thinks he has a chance there but to draw free national publicity as he condemned the governor's record.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And unless there is money to be collected, candidates do not venture into states that they consider sure to win. They campaign, in person and on television, in the states where they think they lead or trail narrowly. For example, starting last month, Mr. Gore began spending heavily on television commercials aimed at 18 states: Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Kentucky, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Republicans were on the air for two weeks, went off, and then resumed the battle of the airwaves this week. Mr. Rove said the Gore commercials had no impact. ''There are now seven states where we have polling that took place before their advertising and polling that took place after,'' he said. ''And in all seven of the states, we've held ground or moved up. The only way it may have helped is to keep us from moving ahead.'' He said the advertisements were ''based on a flawed assumption that people are going to pay a lot of attention to advertising during the summer.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Tad Devine, a top strategist for Mr. Gore, countered that the polls cited by the Bush camp were unreliable. ''That's a little three-card monte on their side,'' he said, arguing that Bush operatives made a ''terrible error in strategic judgment'' by not keep the campaign's commercials running -- and forfeited an opportunity to build bigger leads in several states.

  Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, disagrees with the Bush camp as well. She is conducting the largest polling operation of the year, 100,000 interviews this year in key states night after night.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dean Jamieson studied the eight states where Mr. Gore (through the financial fig leaf of the Democratic National Committee) spent at least $300,000 more than Mr. Bush (through the Republican National Committee). Those states were Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. Over all, Dean Jamieson found that Mr. Gore had gained 10 percentage points on average in those states. ''He was closing substantially,'' she said. ''It is reasonable to say the ads worked.''

  After months in which Mr. Bush seemed to have the advantage, national polls made public this week showed the race closer than previous surveys by the same organizations. Those national polls, with their consistent methodology, provide a rough guidelines to the contours of any presidential race.

  MICHIGAN -- Leans Bush. He has campaigned hard in the state, and almost all of Mr. Nader's support, eight percent in one recent poll, is coming out of Mr. Gore's base. Hostility from the auto workers and teamsters are making it harder for him to capitalize on economic issues.

''I'm certainly not going to be embarrassed and have the state go the other way,'' Mr. Bush said. Nevertheless, Al Cardenas, the state Republican chairman, said he feared that Mr. Gore could pick Bob Graham, the popular Senator from the state, as his running mate, which would force a competition there. ''If Graham gives him a couple of points in Florida, in a tight race we obviously would have to work a little harder,'' Mr. Cardenas said.

  But the choice of television markets was an instant subject for dissection by Gore campaign officials, who pointed to the inclusion of Florida as a sign that some crucial states which might normally be safely in the Republican column were viewed by the Bush campaign as in need of some media triage.

  Aides to Vice President Al Gore would not say whether the campaign would respond rapidly with commercials of its own. Up to now, spots featuring the presumptive nominees have been run exclusively by the Democratic and Republican national committees; the Democrats alone are expected to have spent about $25 million by the time they open their convention in Los Angeles next month.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Fleischer said that the 30-second spots were designed to reinforce presidential qualities of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ''The theme running through the ads is leadership. Now is the time in American history we can exercise bold leadership willing to unite America.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Indeed, the commercials concede a point that Mr. Gore has made a cornerstone of his campaign this summer, that the country is enjoying an unparalleled era of prosperity. The Bush campaign argues in the advertisements that the national economic upswing should be the foundation for a shift to Republican leadership committed to solving complicated problems like how to shore up Social Security and raise standards in schools.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  In one spot, titled ''Hard Things,'' Mr. Bush looks into the camera and says, ''This is a moment in history when we have a chance to focus on tough problems. It's not always popular to say, 'Our children can't read, or Social Security needs improving, or we have a budget surplus and a deficit of values.' But those are the right things to say.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  While political spots are sometimes tested with focus groups before being put on the air, these were not, said a Bush adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. But in market surveys of voters, the adviser said, ''consistently, for some reason, Bush scores overwhelmingly higher than Gore on the question of strong leadership.''
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Greg Stevens, who made the commercials for Senator John McCain of Arizona during the primaries, said the Bush campaign's selection of states for the media buy was ''probably smart,'' in that ''if they can block him in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, Gore can't win.''

  Has there ever been a presidential campaign headquarters more boring than George W. Bush's? The Bush people don't have staff shake-ups. They haven't had to move the offices so the candidate could find himself. They don't even spend their days gossiping on the phone or backbiting their superiors.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The fact is they are grinds. The atmosphere in Austin is dull and professional, according to people who spend a lot of time there. The offices look like they belong to a corporate law firm, and the Bushies squirrel away in their cubicles from dawn till dark. They operate like a White House in waiting, with sophisticated paper routing, West Wing-style briefings, and multilayered speech vetting. One gets the impression that if they ever did have a late night pizza bash, they'd use knives, forks and cloth napkins.

  But this season there are no outsiders. The Bush campaign is about as insurgent as General Electric or I.B.M. If the Bushies win, they can cancel the White House orientation because everybody will have already worked there. The foreign policy team is like a Desert Storm reunion tour: Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Paul Wolfowitz and Robert Zoellick all worked for President George Bush. One exception is Richard Perle, and he worked in the Reagan administration. On the domestic side are prominent Bush administration alumni like Lawrence Lindsey, Josh Bolton and Michael Boskin. The Bush campaign looks as much like an incumbent campaign as the Gore one. Measured by governing experience, the edge actually goes to the G.O.P.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  It was not long ago that the Republicans were neck-deep in populism. In the Gingrich era, this was the party of term limits. But now the G.O.P. is enthusiastic about a campaign of seasoned veterans. This really does represent a Risorgimento of the establishment. From the 1970's to the 1990's, the New Right adopted some of the mindset of the New Left. It was better to be an anti-establishment rebel than an insider or a member of the mainstream. It was cool to call yourself a radical and a revolutionary. But since the Gingrich revolution flamed out, the establishmentarians have reasserted themselves. They saw George W. Bush as their vehicle for retaking their party. They chose him as much as he gathered them.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So now we have a situation in which the challenger looks like a steadier hand than the sitting vice president. Even as Mr. Bush has been getting gravitas implants from the G.O.P. elder statesmen, Al Gore has adopted the pose of a protean outsider, first moving his headquarters to Nashville from Washington and then posing as a populist to counter the challenge of Ralph Nader. Worse, whereas Mr. Bush has accumulated the 1927 Yankees of foreign policy advisers, Gore  relies on one person, a semi-obscure aide named Leon Fuerth. Whereas Bush stands at the head of a phalanx of sober experts, corporate buddies and G.O.P. bigwigs, Gore keeps his own counsel.
 </textdata>

  There may not be much romance in the Bush campaign. There will be no ''bliss to be alive'' moments. But after a few decades of anti-establishment rhetoric, a little prosaic dullness may fit the national mood.

  The senator signaled his willingness to be Mr. Bush's running mate this week in a telephone conversation with Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, according to the Republican official close to Mr. McCain. The official said Mr. Ridge telephoned Mr. McCain on Tuesday to say that he believed he was no longer in the running for the No. 2 slot and to urge Mr. McCain to put his name into consideration.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Karen P. Hughes, the governor's spokeswoman, said simply, ''Governor Bush has said all along that he takes Senator McCain at his word that he does not wish to be considered for the vice presidency.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. McCain has long been considered an unlikely choice for Mr. Bush because of the premium that the Texas governor places on loyalty and the sometimes strained relations between the two men.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-21-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The attention that focused on Mr. McCain today may have been nothing more than the wishful thinking of his loyalists. It also reflected the frenzy of speculation among political insiders about whom Mr. Bush will pick.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Mr. McCain was among a number of politicians whose phone numbers were collected today by aides to Richard B. Cheney, the former defense secretary who is heading Mr. Bush's search team, so that the Bush campaign can let them know in the coming days of the Texas governor's decision.

  Ending months of silence, former Senator Bill Bradley plans to appear alongside Vice President Al Gore next week to voice what Democratic officials described as his ''enthusiastic support'' for the man who trounced him in the bitterly contested Democratic presidential primaries last spring, Democratic officials said last night.

  The appearance comes just as Mr. Gore is working hard to unify the party in time for the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles next month, the event many Democrats are counting on to give his campaign a lift going into the home stretch this fall.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  In recent days, Mr. Gore has been trying to energize the Democratic base in his public appearances by using such tactics as attacking the oil and pharmaceutical industries.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Smoothing things over with Mr. Bradley would be an important step in energizing the party, many Democrats say. A cloud of bitterness has hung over the relationship between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley since Mr. Bradley quit the race in March without having carried a single state. Some Democrats contend that friction has hurt Mr. Gore's ability to present a united front for the party.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He also said he would not release the roughly 400 delegates he had won until the party's convention, raising the possibility that he might start policy fights with the vice president's camp. And he chided Mr. Gore for a hard-edged campaign style, a criticism the Republicans have repeatedly echoed in recent months.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I hope that he'll run a better campaign in the general election,'' Mr. Bradley said of Mr. Gore at the time.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bradley's unequivocal support could help take the edge off Republican assertions that Mr. Gore is a dirty fighter and dishonest politician who will do or say whatever it takes to win. And because Mr. Bradley received much support from Republicans and independents, he could help Mr. Gore woo swing voters who are likely to determine the outcome in closely contested states.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 </date>
 <textdata>
  Discussions about when Mr. Bradley would campaign with Mr. Gore had been going on for several months, primarily between Tony Coelho, the former head of the Gore campaign, and John Roos, a fund-raiser and confidant to Mr. Bradley. William M. Daley, who replaced Mr. Coelho and has a good relationship with Mr. Bradley, picked up the negotiations when Mr. Coelho quit last month.

  With Mr. Gore starting to draw starker contrasts between himself and his expected Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, this seemed like the right time for the two former rivals to appear together, an aide to Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We're beginning to ramp into the convention,'' he said. ''It's a good time for all Democrats to come together and focus on the task at hand. The differences between Gore and Bradley are minuscule compared to the miles of differences between them and George W. Bush.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The aide continued, ''Both Gore and Bradley were in favor of improving our health care system, and George W. Bush has not offered anything of substance.''

  But at times, the intersection of health and politics has been less than smooth: when Geri Barish, the executive director of Hewlett House, made a radio commercial for George W. Bush this year, it did not sit well with some people. Soon afterward, Democrats moved to cut her county salary, which was part of their payroll, saying she should be paid by the Health Department. Last week, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, said he would find money for her somewhere in the county budget.

  ''Goblet'' is even longer than ''Acheson: The Secretary of State Who Created the American World,'' the book George W. Bush started carrying around last year when questions arose about his intellectual firepower. (It is doubtful that Mr. Bush read any 752-page novels in his youth. When asked to name his favorite childhood book, he once mentioned ''The Willie Mays Story,'' which he later admitted was not actually a book. His other responses have included his fourth-grade history text and ''The Very Hungry Caterpillar,'' which was written the year after he graduated from Yale.)

  A CHANGE IN VACATION PLANS  While political operatives and journalists fish for information about the status of Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma in the Republican vice-presidential sweepstakes, Mr. Keating is actually set to go fishing in Alaska next week. And it turns out that he was supposed to have been accompanied by the man charged with helping Gov. George W. Bush of Texas select a running mate, former Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney. A few days ago, Mr. Keating called Mr. Cheney and offered to stay home, lest their trip set too many tongues to wagging. But Mr. Cheney had already decided he was too busy to go. Even so, the initial arrangements for the trip, made before Mr. Cheney had assumed his role in the Bush campaign, demonstrated the many connections and long friendship between Mr. Cheney and Mr. Keating. Mr. Cheney has other Oklahoma ties: he is chief executive of the Halliburton Company, a Texas-based energy company that has operations in Oklahoma; and he was the national fund-raising chairman for the memorial in Oklahoma City for the victims of the 1995 bombing there.

  DIVERSITY ON THE DAIS  In an effort to emphasize diversity, the Republican National Committee has picked three members of Congress -- a Hispanic, an African-American and a woman -- for leadership roles at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. They are Representatives Henry Bonilla of Texas, J. C. Watts of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of Washington. Each will help preside over the convention and deliver a speech. While the Bush campaign said yesterday that the appointments symbolized Mr. Bush's desire for the party to become more inclusive, the Gore campaign dismissed the appointments as being more symbolic than substantial. Others named to leadership positions are Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York.

  He said he would devote $339 billion to shoring up the program during the next decade and adding a new prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. Mr. Bush, he said, had allotted ''not one dime in his proposal for extending, strengthening, adding to Medicare. Not a penny.''

  Time and again, Mr. Gore directed pointed and detailed questions at Mr. Bush, who rarely talks about Medicare.

  ''And that's why the big pharmaceutical companies are supporting Governor Bush,'' Mr. Gore said. ''That's why the big oil companies are supporting Governor Bush.

  Today's debate about Medicare was a sign of a new stage in the Gore campaign. This spring he repeatedly denounced Mr. Bush's policy proposals as ''risky.''

 <date>

 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign also called Mr. Gore and President Clinton obstacles to keeping Medicare solvent because last year all four of Mr. Clinton's appointees to a bipartisan, 17-member group opposed its chairman's ideas for overhauling the health care program.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Al Gore's charts and graphs can't hide the fact that the Clinton-Gore administration opposed bipartisan Medicare reform and they submitted a budget to cut Medicare spending by $70 billion,'' said another Bush spokesman, Dan Bartlett, pointing to some savings Mr. Clinton had proposed for the program in his 2001 budget. Mr. Bush would not support those reductions, Mr. Bartlett said.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush has criticized the Clinton administration for opposing the Breaux plan. And Mr. Bush's broad concepts generally mirror those of the majority on the commission.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore has taken a different approach, shying away from the efforts to turn more of the program over to private insurers. He would use $40 billion of the expected budget surplus and $75 billion of savings in interest payments from paying down the national debt to extend the life of Medicare until 2030. He would also enact nearly $30 billion in savings.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000

  Mr. Gore told his audience today that he had opposed the Medicare commission's report because he felt it would raise the eligibility age, lead to higher premiums and push more people into H.M.O.'s.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bartlett, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the governor supported the concepts of the Breaux commission. But he said Mr. Bush had not said where he stood on the eligibility age, and he said the governor did not believe that the Breaux plan would lead to premium increases.

  Mr. Bush has not set out his own Medicare plan but instead named six principles for change. He has said there should be no rise in payroll taxes. And he wants Medicare to offer every recipient a ''choice of plans including the option of purchasing a plan that covers prescription drugs.'' He has said Medicare must cover expenses for low-income elderly.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000

  Think of what Mr. Clinton could do to energize the Gore campaign: He would certainly help Mr. Gore overcome his problem with women voters, and, have no doubt, Mr. Clinton, who knows every issue inside out, would destroy any Republican vice-presidential candidate in a debate. For that matter, Mr. Clinton could eat George W. Bush for breakfast in a debate and not even know he ate him. And, be honest, who does a funeral better than Bill Clinton? That's the vice president's most important task.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Clinton also solves another problem. He's already had his background -- not to mention his body parts, body fluids and DNA -- checked by everyone from Paula Jones to the F.B.I. So Mr. Gore wouldn't have to worry about any surprises coming out of his closet -- like draft-dodging, pot-smoking, philandering or land speculating -- since the Clinton closet has already been opened and emptied twice over. How many potential vice-presidential candidates can say they've survived an impeachment inquiry? We're talking vetted here, folks. Though Mr. Clinton may be disbarred in Arkansas (isn't that an oxymoron?), he has never been convicted of anything. That should count for something.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-7-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There is no question that Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton get along, so there are no worries there, and there is also no question that Mr. Clinton would love the job. First of all, he wouldn't have to move to that Potemkin house in New York but could spend four more years in government housing at the vice president's residence on Massachusetts Avenue. Second, it would give Mr. Clinton a job, now that he appears to be on the verge of losing his license to practice law. And being vice president has got to be more fun than being on the board of Disney. I mean, whom would you rather report to -- Al Gore or Michael Eisner?

  Vice President Al Gore today denounced the ''do-nothing-for-people Congress'' and challenged Gov. George W. Bush to ''make one phone call'' to instruct Republican leaders to pass major pieces of stalled legislation.

  Setting out the themes he will strike in a seven-state campaign swing next week, Mr. Gore in an interview tried to tie Mr. Bush tightly to the Republican-controlled Congress and to the legislative stalemate on an array of issues.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  ''Now is the moment when those of us who want to lead this country must stand up and be counted,'' Mr. Gore said. ''People deserve to know where we stand on the key issues now being blocked by the Republican leadership of Congress at the behest of the special interests.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore went on to name four issues that Congressional Democrats hope to ride hard to regain control of the House: an increase in the minimum wage, cleanup of toxic waste sites, a prescription drug benefit and regulation of health maintenance organizations.
 </textdata>

  ''My opponent has spoken in very general terms about the kind of candidate he will be, but he has been completely silent on these key issues,'' Mr. Gore said in a phone call from Air Force Two.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The question,'' he said, ''is whether or not George Bush will call the Republican leadership and tell them to pass a real patients' bill of rights. Many moderate Republicans want that. Independent voters want it. Democrats certainly want it. The special interests and the G.O.P. leaders in Congress do not. We are just one phone call away from giving the medical decisions back to the doctors.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. Gore plans to ride the same theme all next week -- just as Congress returns to Washington -- in an attempt to get voters to view Mr. Bush, the Republican Congress and the Republicans' large campaign contributors as one big triangle.
 </textdata>

  The Texas governor has managed to distance himself from the Congress by running as a ''compassionate conservative.'' That implicitly sets Mr. Bush apart from the conservatives former Speaker Newt Gingrich brought into the majority in 1994.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And in some cases it is easier to run against the Republicans in Congress than against Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  ''Governor Bush could call Senator Lott and fix this with one telephone conversation,'' Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's aides called Mr. Gore's demand that the Texas governor step into the legislative debate a sign of the Democrat's own weaknesses.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is an amazing display of a lack of leadership for the sitting vice president to call on the governor of Texas to pass legislation his administration has failed to get done,'' said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore's new tack builds upon the ideas he began airing several weeks ago when he started asking ''whose side are you on'' and depicting Mr. Bush and the Republicans in Congress as siding with powerful business interests over consumers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore today kept hammering away at his refrain of just one phone call. Turning to a prescription drug benefit, he said, ''If Governor Bush is willing to stand up to the big drug companies all he has to do is make one phone call and tell the leadership to pass this legislation and America's seniors will be able to get help.'' Mr. Gore said that as president he would veto the Republicans' version of a prescription drug bill.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have sharp philosophical differences on some of these issues. While Mr. Gore wants an expansive new prescription drug benefit added into Medicare, Mr. Bush generally supports the concept of the House Republicans. They recently passed a bill that would give subsidies and incentives to private insurers to offer prescription drug policies to the elderly.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore and the Democrats back a $1 increase in the minimum wage across two years. Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush favored an increase in the minimum wage but wanted states to have the right to opt out of it if they thought the wage increase would slow job creation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore backs the more wide-ranging version. Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush wants more people covered than the Senate does but differs somewhat with the House provisions on a right to sue companies.

  Some of the governor's staff members have been quietly pointing out what a valuable asset Mrs. Whitman might be to the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, George W. Bush -- either as a vice presidential running mate or, should he win the White House, as a high-ranking member of his administration.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Perhaps. But with Mr. Bush leading in the polls and the Republican Convention later this month in Philadelphia, just an hour from the governor's day job, Mrs. Whitman's name is being uttered in a lot of parlors. And most of the people talking about a George W. administration as if it were a rotisserie baseball league know that the realities of New Jersey politics mean that Mrs. Whitman's biggest accomplishments as governor are almost certainly behind her.

  Perhaps no issue touches as many lives as the cost of medication, which is why it is consuming the political landscape this year. Last week, Vice President Al Gore attacked drug manufacturers, accusing them of price gouging. The week before, the House of Representatives approved a Republican-backed plan to give subsidies to insurance companies that offer prescription coverage, a concept favored by the drug makers.

  Interestingly, the rules of the ''Big Brother'' show state that ''You must not now be a candidate for public office and must agree not to become one until after the initial broadcast of all programs in which you appear.'' Too bad. I can't think of a better way to learn what we really want to know about Al Gore and George W. Bush than by throwing them into the ''Big Brother'' house for 90 days with eight putatively ordinary folks. Perhaps voter turnout in November would be higher if, as on ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother,'' a vote for a candidate were actually a vote against him.

  After the deficit gloom of the 1980's, that number is so huge that it invites Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush to engage in a war of  promises. Up to a point, that is healthy. A surplus of more than $4 trillion ought to spark debate about options whose price tags have until now scared off all but the most intrepid of politicians. Yet the voters cannot become intoxicated by the numbers to the point of believing that it is possible to have tax relief plus hugely expensive new programs and significant debt reduction all at the same time. The important task remains choosing policy targets wisely.

  Then there is another factor squeezing down the size of the usable surplus that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have to argue over. Budget estimates assume that spending on most existing federal programs outside Social Security and Medicare -- covering everything from scientific research to law enforcement -- will remain unchanged. In fact, reasonable spending growth and Congress's reluctance to let several temporary tax credits expire will eat up $600 billion, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. The upshot is that by this reckoning the next president and Congress will have slightly less than $1 trillion of the original $4.2 trillion to pay for new programs or tax cuts.

  This information helps frame the discussion of tax and spending proposals being put forth by the presidential candidates and by many Congressional candidates, as well. On the Democratic side, Mr. Gore proposes to cut taxes by about $500 billion over 10 years, creating subsidies for college tuition, individual retirement accounts, child care, individual health coverage, nursing-home care, energy conservation, low-wage workers and married couples. He would spend about $250 billion on prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees and about $300 billion for transportation, energy projects, medical coverage for low-income families and education.

  Mr. Bush would cut taxes by more than $1 trillion over 10 years. He also proposes to increase defense, health and other domestic spending by more than $200 billion. His plan to divert part of the payroll tax to create private Social Security accounts would eventually draw on general tax revenues by an unknown amount that could run into the hundreds of billions.

  Still, how they react is their business. As Richard N. Haass, a Brookings Institution scholar and former official in the Bush Administration, noted recently, any ''effort to assert or expand U.S. hegemony will fail. Such an action would lack domestic support and stimulate international resistance, which in turn would make the costs of hegemony all the greater and its benefits all the smaller.''

  Now Vice President Al Gore has dispatched Christopher on what is, in its way, one of the most challenging assignments he has ever taken on: to sort through the weakest Democratic field in modern memory and find the few men or women who could be a next vice president of the United States -- in short, to create the List. Because there is a lack of obvious candidates, Christopher's task is a far more formidable one than he faced eight years ago, when he oversaw Clinton's search for those who might make a vice president. Of course, that means Gore's ultimate choice is harder than Clinton's was. And yet there may be no more consequential decision for Gore: after what seem like interminable reinventions and remakes, the vice president is still struggling to ignite his campaign. It may be that the only way Gore can win in November is if he successfully reintroduces himself at the party's convention in Los Angeles next month. That can only happen if he picks the right running mate.

  It is a long way from identifying prospects to finding the right match. Gore's presence on the ticket eight years ago did not, by itself, win Clinton the White House. But it helped resurrect a presidential nominee who, before the Gore announcement, was stuck in the polls behind President Bush -- and in some surveys, was even trailing Ross Perot. The tableau of Clinton and Gore and their families standing side by side outside the governor's mansion in Little Rock signaled to the country that this ticket was young and vibrant -- and not wedded to the timeworn tradition that a running mate's sole value is someone who can balance the ticket geographically.

  Gore could use that kind of magic. But even were he to dare go for a spine-tingling choice, the problem he faces is that there is a dearth of spine-tingling choices. Republicans eagerly reel off a host of governors and up-and-comers in Congress with compelling biographies, from Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma to Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to Representative John Kasich of Ohio to Elizabeth Dole. Ask Democrats their favorites, and there is, almost always, a moment of silence. Then they end up resurrecting the names of people who have been passed over before. One close friend of Gore's, a figure in Democratic politics for decades, is downright unsettled. ''Names come up that may be sound but there are no home runs in the crowd. Who is out there who would lead people to say, 'Al Gore strikes a home run'? For the life of me, I can't imagine who it is.''

  Al Gore disputes that there is no future Al Gore. ''There are quite a number of people out there who are at least as ready for the job as I was eight years ago,'' he told me recently. But then, conceding that the next vice president might take some molding, he went on to say, ''The question is how you grow into the job.''

  Eight years ago, when Christopher began his talent search for Clinton, job-ready talent abounded: Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. And there was a centrist, international-minded Southern senator named Gore. His name first made Christopher's V.P. list in April 1992. Clinton was in Tallahassee for a campaign event at Florida A&amp;M (students there questioned his explanations for his experimentation with marijuana and his Vietnam draft status), and at his hotel there one morning he met secretly with Christopher and Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman, for a vice-presidential brainstorming session. Clinton's closest aide, Bruce Lindsey, wandered in and out as Clinton and company tossed out names and came up with a list of 38, including 15 that were designated high priority. (Gore was on the prime list from the start.) It was at that meeting that Clinton first emphasized the importance of not being locked in to traditional concerns about ticket balancing, as Michael Dukakis had in picking Senator Lloyd Bentsen four years earlier, when the campaign boasted about a Boston-Austin axis. (A lot of good it did: Dukakis lost Texas.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Christopher first interviewed Gore in late May 1992 at the United Methodist Building in Washington, across the street from the Supreme Court, Gore, then a senator, was putting the final touches on his book ''Earth in the Balance.'' Discussing that meeting with Gore, Christopher says he was ''impressed by his intellectual equipment and his high personal standards.'' Others probably would not have been intrigued if Gore showed them corrections he'd made on the galleys, but Christopher was. And he says he appreciated, too, that Gore did not immediately jump at the possibility of being vice president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At that session, Gore, responding to Christopher's usual query, suggested others who might be tapped as Clinton's running mate. Gore says some of those same names are on his list today. He would not name names, however, explaining, ''It's too radioactive right now.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gore expressed no such qualms when Christopher tracked him down in Rio, where he was attending an environmental conference. There was one proviso: Gore asked for 24 hours to think over whether he wanted to be a finalist. Some Clinton advisers wondered whether Gore -- who long nursed presidential ambitions of his own -- was playing too hard-to-get. Christopher, having seen people make wrongheaded decisions when they were abroad, approved of his prudence.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gore, of course, did not change his mind. He allowed his name to be put forth, as did the four others on the list: Senator Bob Graham of Florida, Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Clinton met secretly with each of these contenders, mostly at the Capital Hilton, a few blocks from the White House. On June 30, Gore was spirited through a back door for what had been planned as an hourlong session, the length allotted for all the finalists. Clinton and Gore started talking at 10 p.m. and were still chatting well past 1 a.m. They got so comfortable that eventually they both stretched out on the floor, their backs against two couches as they faced one another.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The next morning, Clinton kept his counsel, leaving even Christopher sniffing for clues. But judging by the length of the meeting, he figured Gore had shot to the top of Clinton's mental list, or close to it. Gore had no doubt. Asked last month when he knew the job was his, he replied, ''That night -- if I wanted it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A little more than a week later, the Clintons and Gores introduced themselves to the nation in Little Rock, the most enduring scene of the 1992 campaign. And one that Gore desperately wants to recreate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ask Gore how he will pick a suitable partner, and he provides a response that makes the process sound so utterly logical -- and so easy. ''There is one criterion that overshadows all the others by far,'' he says, ''and that is, Who has the clear ability to become president on a moment's notice should that need ever arise?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There is a great deal beyond that one criterion, as Gore well knows -- there is the whole equation of pluses and minuses that is any politician's life, and another equation of costs and benefits that a choice might bring to a presidential ticket. Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois is probably the favorite of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate, and he is a skilled politician who could help Gore carry his must-win state. But Gore has a decent shot at Illinois anyway. Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, is a time-tested politician who is popular with labor and could help carry a vitally important state. But he is the ultimate Washington insider -- and what he really wants is to win back the House so he can be speaker. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts may be closest to the Gore model: he has an impressive biography and he is agile on the stump. But the last place Gore needs help is the Northeast.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Few of those most widely discussed would bring to Gore something Gore brought to Clinton in 1992: a sense of flair and the future. Voters back then could instantly envision Gore running for president in eight years. Many of the current prospects will be well into their 60's and may seem too old to run in 2008. Gore is now 52. But eight years hence, Graham will be 72; Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina, 71; Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, 75; and Gephardt, 67. There are appealing prospects in their late 40's, but they are virtually unknown nationally: Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin.
 </textdata>

  A close Gore aide was mulling the choices -- or lack thereof -- one recent night when he came up with the only combination that sounded imaginative, and familiar. ''Could we pick Clinton?'' he asks. (The answer: the Constitution does not prevent a president from being elected vice president.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Part of the quandary is that there is no one who solves all of Gore's needs. He wants someone to zip up his persona. But after eight years in Clinton's shadow, he does not want someone with so much zip that the person will overshadow him. He wants a combative partisan who can fearlessly run down Bush in the campaign. But he wants someone who, as vice president, would not make waves or be a threat. He wants someone who can help him carry a battleground state. But he does not want to be accused of picking someone for purely political reasons. He wants someone no one is thinking of to provide some electricity at the convention. But he does not want someone who is so untested that he or she falls flat off the political stage.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000

 <textdata>
  That leaves Gore searching for, well, another Gore. Bill Daley, in an interview just before he was named Gore's campaign chairman, said two of his choices would be Clinton appointees: Robert Rubin, the former treasury secretary, and Bill Richardson, the energy secretary. (That was before anyone knew Richardson would have to answer for sky-high gas prices as well as for the disappearance of nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos weapons lab.) Daley also mentioned the former Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell, and his successor, Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The only relatively young, attractive prospect that Daley or anyone talks about is Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, who is 44. But he has the misfortune of seeming like a young Gore clone. They are both sons of senators; they both attended the same Washington prep school. Moreover, Bayh falls into the uninspired category of ''safe choice.''

  There just are not that many young Democrats ready for the national stage. The Republicans don't have that problem, thanks in large part to Ronald Reagan. His presidency spurred Republicans to enter politics; it was something of a cause. Many of those Republicans have moved up the ladder to become governors and people on Bush's prospect list. But a Democratic farm team never materialized during the Reagan years -- or the Clinton years. Clinton has so dominated the national stage that there has been little room for anyone to emerge, especially with Congress under Republican rule.

  ''I was inspired to get into this business because of the role models there were,'' says Leon Panetta, the former California congressman who was a chief of staff for Clinton. ''They're missing now. That's one of the problems Al Gore is having in looking for someone.''

  Another consideration is that when it comes time for Gore to announce his choice -- probably just before the Democratic convention in mid-August -- Bush will have already made his pick at the Republican convention. So if Bush picks a woman, for example, Gore may feel compelled to as well. The nightmare scenario in the vice president's camp is that Bush, with more choices, will pick such an attention-grabber as his No. 2 that Gore will be especially hard pressed to come up with someone dynamic.

  Gore insists that he's not interested in springing a splashy surprise. That may be because he really doesn't think it matters -- or because there are no splashy candidates and he is trying to lower expectations. ''I don't think the drama has more than transitory value,'' he says. ''It needs to feel right.''

  Others, too, it appears, have shelved self-effacement. Gore campaign aides say they have been struck by the overt efforts by Senator Kerry and Secretary of Energy Richardson to win Gore over. Even prospects who insist that they are not interested happily make a case for their candidacies. Gov. Gray Davis of California says he promised his state's voters that he would stay put. But the famously ''gray'' governor, whose favorite joke is that he has given charisma lessons to the vice president, sounds suspiciously as if he is putting his name forward when he counsels: ''America is not looking for a rock star or a Hollywood figure. They want a solid, tested leader.''

  So what is Gore to do? he needs someone with whom, most of all, he is comfortable, or as Christopher put it, ''Chemistry weighs very heavily.'' The last thing voters want to see is an awkward Al Gore standing beside an awkward running mate. He should take a lesson from Clinton and not worry so much about geographic balance. John Kennedy's pick of Lyndon Johnson in 1960 was the last time a running mate delivered a big state (Texas) -- and a victory in November.

  Gore was not ready to talk in any kind of detail about his choices or his way of arriving at them. What he did seem eager to do was convey that he was relaxed about the process. At the conclusion of our interview, Gore had a question for me. ''How old are you?'' he asked. ''Older than 35?''

  It was, after all, appointees of Gov. George W. Bush who took the lead on the issue. And it was the governor himself who had pushed into law the Texas Parental Notification Act, which required minors to inform their parents before seeking an abortion.

  In recent weeks, particularly after the United States Supreme Court's 5-to-4 ruling that rejected a Nebraska law prohibiting doctors from performing a procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion, the issue of judicial appointments has percolated into the presidential race. Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, seized on the close vote to warn that Mr. Bush, if elected, would appoint conservative Supreme Court justices hostile to abortion rights.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-9-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But a look at Mr. Bush's record in Texas shows that he has appointed justices who have had a moderating influence on the Texas Supreme Court, often regarded as among the most conservative and pro-business in the country. He has appointed four of the court's nine justices and has been a political patron for a fifth, Harriet O'Neill, who wrote the majority opinion in the parental notification case.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Even those who do not support Mr. Bush say that while his appointees are regarded as conservative and business-oriented, they are not fiercely ideological.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  What insight, if any, Mr. Bush's appointments in Texas offer into what he might do in Washington is debatable. The scrutiny and pressure surrounding a nomination to the United States Supreme Court far exceed those accompanying an appointment to the Texas court. Mr. Bush, who opposes abortion, has offered only vague descriptions of his model justices, though, tellingly, he has cited two of the leading conservatives on the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas,  for praise.
 </textdata>

  On the campaign trail, Mr. Bush has said he wants justices who strictly interpret the Constitution. He also has promised not to apply any ideological litmus tests, including one on abortion, even though many of the social conservatives who support him are eager to overturn Roe v. Wade.

  Clay Johnson, a top aide to Mr.  Bush, said he believed the selection process for justices would undoubtedly be different in a Bush presidential administration than it has been in Texas. ''But I think he would be looking as he did at the state level for people who are interpreters of the law as opposed to makers of the law,'' Mr. Johnson said.

  In Texas, Supreme Court justices are elected statewide to six-year terms, but early retirements allowed Mr. Bush to reshape the court. And if anything, the Bush appointees seem in keeping with his campaign theme of ''Big Tent Republicanism.''

  Mr. Bush's first appointee, James A. Baker, was a state appellate judge and a longtime political ally of the Bush family. (He is no relation to the former United States secretary of state.) His second, Greg Abbott, was a highly regarded state judge in Houston who has been paralyzed since an accident 16 years ago. His third, Deborah G. Hankinson, was a teacher-turned-defense lawyer. And his fourth, Alberto R. Gonzales, is one of Mr. Bush's most visible Hispanic allies, having served as the governor's general counsel and as Texas secretary of state.

  The governor appointed Justice O'Neill to a lower court in 1995 and in 1998 she won a seat on the high court with his blessing. All of Mr. Bush's appointees are Republicans and all have since been elected except Mr. Gonzales, who is expected to be elected easily in November.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  In separate interviews this week, Justice Hankinson, Justice Gonzales and Justice Abbott all described a similar interview process with Mr. Bush, who is not a lawyer, and a few aides. None were asked about specific issues like abortion. (In fact, until the parental notification opinion, the court had never had to directly address abortion.) Instead, they said, the governor asked open-ended questions about judicial philosophy to determine how they might view their roles as justices.

  ''I told him I thought it was very, very critical that judges not bring an agenda to the bench,'' said Justice Hankinson, whom Mr. Bush appointed as an appellate judge in 1996, then to the State Supreme Court a year later.

  Debbie D. Branson, president of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, a group that has been critical of the court and Mr. Bush over the years, said the court is ''still not where we'd like them to be'' on consumer issues and other damage claims. But Ms. Branson agreed that the Bush appointees had started the process of moving the court back to the center.

  Mr. Bush took office in January 1995, and his first opportunity to influence the court came that summer when Justice Bob Gammage, a Democrat, announced he would retire. Mr. Gammage had attacked the state's system of electing judges as corrupt and blamed the court for favoring big business, particularly insurance companies. But in an interview this week he called Mr. Bush's appointees fair and nonideological even as he pointed out that the law is not the governor's expertise.

  By the Supreme Court's 1998-99 term, the liberal judicial watchdog group Court Watch found that Mr. Bush's appointees were ''eliminating the excesses of the G.O.P. old guard.'' A Court Watch study determined that the court was showing  more sympathy for plaintiffs.

  Chief Justice Thomas R. Phillips, a leading conservative who took office in 1988, acknowledged that in recent years ''there's been sort of a middle course,'' but he said it was in keeping with national trends.

  ''We have put aside our personal viewpoints and endeavored to do our job as judges -- that is, to interpret and apply the Legislature's will as it has been expressed in the statute,'' Justice O'Neill wrote for the majority, which included Justice Baker, Justice Hankinson, Justice Gonzales and Justice Craig Enoch, a Republican elected in 1992. Chief Justice Philips voted with the majority but did not concur with all the points in the opinion. Of Mr. Bush's appointees, only Justice Abbott dissented.

  Yet Mr. Pojman and Mr. Kral agree that the court's opinion has not shaken their support of Mr. Bush. ''If Bush does what he says and picks justices who stick to the original intent of the Constitution, we'll be in great shape,'' Mr. Pojman said.

  The catalyst was, apparently, a decision by the Philadelphia branch of Act Up, the gay advocacy group, to take up South Africa's cause and start heckling Vice President Al Gore, who was in the midst of his primary campaign for the presidency. The banners saying that Mr. Gore was letting Africans die to please American pharmaceutical companies left his campaign chagrined.

He now has a first-look deal with Alliance Atlantis, an independent distribution and production company and one of the principal backers of ''The Five Senses,'' and he is set to adapt and direct Anne Michaels's acclaimed novel, ''Fugitive Pieces,'' about the legacy of the Holocaust, for the Toronto-based Serendipity Point Films.

  Ever since the war in the Persian Gulf, Colin L. Powell has been the most eagerly courted yet most reluctant member of the Republican Party. Four years ago, he was mentioned as a presidential candidate, and even as recently as last week, rumors were flying about the possibility of him being the running mate of Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Powell, 63, was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1989 to 1993 and served under the man who was chosen as Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, the former secretary of defense.

  Elaine L. Chao, who was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and came to the United States at age 8, has taken part in several forums on race. Ms. Chao, who will speak about immigration, has emphasized the importance of looking at dialogues about race not as a debate between blacks and whites but as a discussion that should include a cross section of races. She was a deputy transportation secretary in the Bush administration and the head of the Federal Maritime Administration in the Reagan administration. She served as director of the Peace Corps from September 1991 to August 1992. In August 1992 she replaced William V. Aramony, who was convicted in 1995 of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy, as president of the United Way of America. She resigned the position in May 1996. She is married to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is the head of his party's campaign committee in the Senate.

In 1988 she was honored for a program she helped start that focused on teaching scholastic and family skills to parents who had not graduated from high school.

  THE SCRIPT -- A narrator reads: ''George W. Bush chose Dick Cheney to help lead the Republican Party. What does Cheney's record say about their plans? Cheney was one of only eight members of Congress to oppose the Clean Water Act. One of the few to vote against Head Start. He even voted against the school lunch program; against health insurance for people who lost their jobs. Cheney, an oil company C.E.O., said it was good for OPEC to cut production so oil and gasoline prices could rise. What are their plans for working families?''

  SCORECARD -- Democrats believe that Mr. Cheney's voting record and his background as an oil industry executive offer rich targets for attack. This hastily produced spot is an effort to define Mr. Cheney as a rock-hard Republican conservative before Republican image-makers at the convention that opens tonight can soften the edges. It intensifies a week of attacks on Mr. Cheney's record, which began the day Mr. Bush announced that Mr. Cheney would be his running mate. But polls taken since the announcement have shown Mr. Bush increasing his lead over Mr. Gore.

  It was the first day of Ms. Huffington's five-day pep rally billed as the Shadow Convention, which opened its doors yesterday at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Center. First on the agenda was Mr. McCain, Ms. Huffington's buddy with the biggest marquee draw -- that is, if you do not include Chuck D of the rap group Public Enemy, who is scheduled to speak later in the week. (Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Jack Kemp both bowed out over a week ago.) But the senator did not stay to make small talk with the talk-show guest; he rushed grumpily through the stage door after the audience booed him for endorsing George W. Bush.

  Ethan A.

  In 1996 Mrs. Whitman was on Bob Dole's short list of potential running mates. This year, as Mrs. Whitman has had to acknowledge in one interview after another, she wasn't even asked to submit personal background material to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush.

  In 1996 she was thought of as an eventual presidential candidate in her own right. Now, if Mr. Bush wins, Mrs. Whitman's prospects are widely seen as limited to a cabinet post, at best, or maybe an ambassadorship -- the political equivalent of being put out to pasture.

  If experience counts for anything -- and it ought to -- the Bush-Cheney slate is one of the most abundantly qualified in memory. As the youngest ever White House chief of staff, Mr. Cheney displayed the qualities instinctively recognized by Governor Bush and most fair-minded voters: a towering intelligence and probity, razor-sharp judgment, and a seriousness of purpose that is the antithesis of modern political spin. Yet there is much more to Dick Cheney than his resume. We know him as a man of conviction, whose principles include respecting others with whom he differs. He has adversaries but no enemies.

  Mr. Cheney also represents an unconventional choice, if only because of the transparent merit which motivated his selection. This alone makes him a refreshing alternative to the usual electoral calculations. He was selected less because he could help Governor Bush get elected than because he could help a president Bush govern. And to do so in a way that will help restore popular respect for tarnished institutions.
 </textdata>

  In another sense, largely unnoticed by the media to date, Mr. Bush's choice deserved high marks for boldness. Implicit in the Bush-Cheney pairing is an appeal not frequently heard at some recent G.O.P. conventions. Quite simply, the governor and the secretary are presenting themselves as leaders who are best equipped by outlook, training and temperament to govern America in a time of exhilarating change and daunting challenges.

  Gov. George W. Bush knows that he cannot be elected president unless he gets votes from many people who do not agree with him or the Republican Party platform on issues such as abortion, gun control, capital punishment and the privatization of Social Security. That is why today is gear-shifting day in Philadelphia. The selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate and the deliberations of the platform committee all emphasized the conservative part of Mr. Bush's background and core vote.

  Somewhat paradoxically, Governor Bush has imposed what he calls an ''iron-fist rule'' to make sure that ideology does not trump his preferred themes of tolerance and inclusion. That means most of the party's hard-line orators will be kept away from the microphones inside First Union Center, site of a convention that is, in essence, a $65 million exercise in recruiting the moderate swing voter. Governor Bush's plan for this convention reflects the lessons of 1992, when his father's lax campaign team gave Pat Buchanan and other polarizing speakers prime-time roles. By way of contrast, Bill Clinton used his party's 1992 convention to play down the Democrats' liberal tradition and to emulate the Republicans' emphasis on fiscal responsibility and welfare reform. In Philadelphia, Mr. Bush will attempt to borrow the positive imagery long associated with such Democratic issues as education and the saving of Social Security and Medicare.

By way of contrast, Bill Clinton used his party's 1992 convention to play down the Democrats' liberal tradition and to emulate the Republicans' emphasis on fiscal responsibility and welfare reform. In Philadelphia, Mr. Bush will attempt to borrow the positive imagery long associated with such Democratic issues as education and the saving of Social Security and Medicare.

  Given the blunt, contrary language of much of the Republican platform, this will require some serious spinning and deft television imagery. The effort began yesterday with such figures as Governors Tommy Thompson and George Pataki giving the platform a decent burial by declaring it basically irrelevant to the Bush campaign. Never mind the restrictive language on abortion. According to Mr. Pataki, what matters more is Mr. Bush's vision. In fact, whereas former President George Bush stumbled over the vision thing, his son is determined to make it a central theme. His emphasis will be on positive evocative language about character, principles, leadership, faith, hope, love, rather than on the Republican policy positions that could make him appear authoritarian, elitist or hostile to the interests of women and minorities. To offset the sparse minority representation, convention planners have given starring roles to Mr. Bush's most prominent black advisers, Gen. Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and included a large number of Hispanic Republicans. The prominence of entertainment figures and musical numbers also bespeaks an effort to steer this convention away from wedge issues.

  President Clinton, in his role of the Democrats' uber-strategist, tried to blow the whistle Friday on what he sees as Mr. Bush's desire to make this a campaign about good feelings rather than hard issues. ''That's the message, isn't it? Blur, blur, blur,'' the president complained. Such critiques are not likely to dent the faith that Mr. Bush and his advisers have in polls showing that voters prefer lofty, positive generalities to bitter partisan wrangling. Another ''iron-fist rule'' imposed by Mr. Bush is that there should be no prolonged attacks on Mr. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore or Hillary Rodham Clinton. The campaign will try to be more deft in invoking Clinton fatigue. Mr. Cheney has taken to depicting the president as a tragic figure. In a television commercial, Mr. Bush speaks of the Clinton years as bringing a budget surplus, but a deficit in values.

  Not all Republicans agree with these soft tactics and the gauzy approach summed up in Mr. Bush's slogan of compassionate conservatism. But suppose he succeeds this week in having undecided voters focus on his soothing, positive statements about education, health care, Social Security and taxes, rather than on the harsh and often unfair policy positions espoused by the platform and the Republican Congressional majority. Then Mr. Bush will be able to count this convention a success, and Mr. Gore can count on having his hands full this fall.

  Reporters repeatedly tested his appetite for his own words, asking, item by item, if he still believed all those nasty things he had said about his former opponent for the Republican presidential nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Over and over, he endorsed the man he had once derided as a phony reformer unprepared for the Oval Office.

  Today, one youthful audience here responded with boos, derisive laughter and cries of ''Drag him off!'' to what he insisted was his ''sincere conviction'' that ''all Americans'' should support Governor Bush. On the eve of Mr. Bush's national convention, Mr. McCain was beginning to seem downright conventional, a quality he despises in politics.
 </textdata>

  7-31-2000

 <textdata>
  This afternoon, as the senator gathered at a reception with senior officials of the Bush campaign to formally release his delegates to the governor, the moment and the message proved too much. Mr. McCain praised Mr. Bush for running a ''centrist, inclusive campaign.'' He urged his supporters to give the Bush campaign ''the same kind of enthusiasm and participation'' they had given him, that had made him believe, for a time, he might be president. Then he tried to say thanks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When he regained control of himself and the room and at last expressed his gratitude, Mr. McCain declared ''This is a time for celebration.'' Then, to groans and cries, he released his remaining delegates -- roughly 150 -- to Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Coming before the four days of processed emotion that is a modern political convention, Mr. McCain's raw moment left some delegates shaken, even as rock music blared and confetti cannons blasted the room. ''People really believed in him,'' said Ric Barros, a lawyer from Massachusetts. ''It's like a death in the family.'' Asked if he would support Mr. Bush, Mr. Barros said: ''In time. Today, I just want to think about John McCain.''
 </textdata>

  Appearing before Mr. McCain, Don Evans, the chairman of Mr. Bush's campaign, praised the senator as ''my American hero'' -- though at least one McCain aide rolled his eyes. Joe Allbaugh, the Bush campaign manager, was also present, though he did not address the crowd.

  The Bush camp can afford to be gracious. Trailing Senator McCain around the margins of the convention here is like watching an episode of ''Survivor'' while knowing who has been voted off the island. The only sense of suspense surrounding his appearances hangs over the question of how far he will go in endorsing Mr. Bush -- and the only surprise registered by his audiences has been over how far he has gone.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000

  It seemed more like a rolling test of his humility. Asked on his bus if he still believed Mr. Bush was a ''Pat Robertson Republican,'' Mr. McCain said quietly, ''No, no, I don't believe that.'' To another oft-repeated question, he insisted that his relationship with Mr. Bush was ''cordial'' or even ''very good.'' Repeatedly, he said that he expected to be supporting Mr. Bush's re-election in 2004 and not running himself.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  But the Arizona senator's self-sacrifice had its limits. He bristled when asked, for perhaps the hundredth time, whether he had checked with the Bush campaign before putting his bus back on the road. ''No,'' he shot back, ''because the last time I checked, I'm a United States senator.'' He repeatedly reminded questioners that he always promised to support his party's nominee -- a caveat that made his endorsement sound more dutiful than heartfelt. But his sense of humor stayed intact. When asked if he would accept a position in a Bush cabinet, he said, as he contended with an enormous soft-serve vanilla waffle cone, that the only job he wanted was emperor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. McCain still admits to differences with Mr. Bush, including over campaign finance reform. But he no longer declares that Mr. Bush should adopt his position, instead noting, as he did at the shadow convention, that ''we agree on many more issues than we disagree on.'' Mr. McCain has repeatedly acknowledged that he is walking a tightrope, trying to retain an insurgent appeal while playing by the rules of party politics. He remains extremely popular, which is why Mr. Bush and scores of congressmen are clamoring for public shows of his support.

  I would vote today to leave the Department of Education in place. I opposed it originally when we first got into that. I think my general view on education is that it's primarily a local and state concern -- that's where the bulk of the funding lies -- but, as Governor Bush has made clear, we've got a fair amount of money we are spending at the federal level today, Title I funds, and that there ought to be accountability with those funds. There hasn't been in the past.

  I'm a strong believer in the Second Amendment and support it. I think the key question, again if we come back to the trivial aspect of the debates that rage in Washington now, it's what we're going to do in the future. And the fact of the matter is I'm perfectly happy to support Governor Bush's proposals with respect to trigger locks for handguns, for example, with respect to prosecuting people guilty of gun crimes. This administration's allowed prosecutions to fall 46 percent. Those are important kinds of questions. . . .

  Mr. Bush has made attacks on trial lawyers a centerpiece of his campaign and has vowed that if elected, he would push a program similar to the one he helped enact in Texas. He has pointed with pride to his record in Texas of curbing civil litigation, capping legal fees and limiting jury awards.

  Mr. Harshbarger said that corporations have been successful in their effort to ''paint lawyers as the bad guys.'' He said it was not surprising that Mr. Gore had tried to keep some distance between himself and the lawyers.

  Mr. Clinton's appearance at the convention is, in a sense, as a surrogate for Mr. Gore and, to a lesser extent, for other Democrats, notably Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the United States Senate from New York.

  Ralph Nader, the longtime consumer advocate who has been closely allied with trial lawyers on the issue of civil litigation rules, said Mr. Gore was allowing the president to take the heat of associating with the lawyers while he was reaping the benefits.
 </textdata>

  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He cited as an example, that Mr. Gore did not respond to a speech in  February in which Mr. Bush told a South Carolina audience of business people that Mr. Bush would immediately seek changes in litigation rules if elected.

  For his part, Mr. Bush continued his slow march toward Philadelphia, campaigning at the replica of the historic Crosley Field in the suburbs of Cincinnati. Several thousand people withstood a driving rain to see him as he drove up in a campaign bus emblazoned with the slogan ''Renewing America's Purpose,'' the theme of his five-day tour through battleground states. He told the Republican members of Congress sharing the stage with him: ''Be patient. Help is on the way.''

  Mr. Cheney, who has made only a few campaign stops since being selected as Mr. Bush's running mate, made a brief appearance here this afternoon, promising ''most of all to make America proud again by giving them a president they can respect.'' He spoke for four minutes at the hotel where he will be joined by Mr. Bush on Wednesday, and he seemed overwhelmed by his reception from a crowd organized by the campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney also sought to generate support, Mr. Bush's primary-season nemesis, Senator John McCain of Arizona, also made a pitch for the ticket. Appearing before the ''shadow convention,'' an event ranging from reformist to radical, he gamely asked the audience to vote for Mr. Bush and was soundly booed for his troubles. Then he went before his own delegates and formally released them from commitments to vote for him. Many groaned.

  Meanwhile, the Bush camp's plans for a conflict-free convention chugged along without serious difficulty. Abortion-rights advocates insisted they were working to find the required six states to support new language in the platform acknowledging diverse views on the subject, but they had yet to find them. One minor rules squabble was shaping up -- over an effort to make all 165 members of the Republican National Committee automatic delegates at the next national convention.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000

 <textdata>
  There was no formal convention business beyond the arrival of 2,066 delegates -- mostly middle-aged white men and generally more conservative than the voters who gave Mr. Bush the nomination -- assembled in the city where Republicans have nominated five previous candidates, from John C. Fremont in 1856 through Thomas E. Dewey in 1948.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But it became increasingly clear that despite the shadow convention and occasional minor demonstrations like today's peaceful march of 7,000 for a variety of causes, the four-day show beginning Monday is all about Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Davis said: ''This convention is about electing George W. Bush. It's not about the House and Senate.'' He said Republican hopes of retaining the House, where they now hold only a 13-seat majority, would be aided by Mr. Bush's ''creating an updraft that our candidates can take advantage of.''
 </textdata>

  On CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' he said: ''The campaign that Governor Bush and I will run is very much oriented towards the future.

  Of the various stories about their relationship that Laura and George W. Bush like to tell, not one gets a more frequent and thorough workout than this: she married him only after they had reached an agreement that she would never, ever have to make a political speech on his behalf.

 <date>
  7-31-2000

 <textdata>
  She must have been skeptical. It was the end of 1977, and Mr. Bush was gearing up for what would turn out to be an ill-fated campaign for a Congressional seat from West Texas, and his father was laying the groundwork for his own ill-fated presidential bid in 1980. These were the Bushes -- politics was in their plasma. Her vow of silence was doomed from the start.

  Laura Bush's appearance at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia on Monday night will be the latest -- and by far the most nerve-frazzling -- illustration of that. She is scheduled to deliver the first major address of the event, with thousands of people spread out before her, the invisible eyes of a national television audience on her and the responsibility for properly jump-starting a four-day jubilee in her hands.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000

 <textdata>
  The couple's remarks point to one of the most intriguing aspects of Laura Welch Bush, a trait that sets her apart from many of her predecessors on this path: she never aspired to it, never planned on it, never looked out across the broad expanse of the future and saw herself in a wash of light, with a microphone under her chin. Even now, several of her friends and acquaintances say, she could trade it all for long afternoons of reading or mornings of gardening and be utterly happy -- perhaps even happier.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And yet, friends and relatives say, she has adapted to her role in the limelight and her part as a political spouse with relative ease and remarkable vigor, drawing on a serious (albeit quiet) intellect to become an active first lady in Texas and to develop a public voice and style more mellifluous than her husband's, and maybe even more assured. Many of the voters who take note of Mrs. Bush for the first time on Monday night will undoubtedly be surprised and impressed by that, and will get little sense of the reluctance she openly expressed before Gov. George W. Bush began his campaign for the White House last year.
 </textdata>

  Barbara Bush, the former first lady, said in a recent interview that her daughter-in-law adhered to ''a great philosophy in life -- you can either like it or not, so you might as well like it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Laura Bush said that her convention speech was, in fact, a harbinger of more activity and a higher profile for her. With the couple's twin 18-year-old daughters, Jenna and Barbara, heading off to college around Labor Day and leaving the Bushes with an empty nest, Mrs. Bush plans to hit the campaign trail full time, at her husband's side and on her own.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mrs. Bush made it clear that her interest was in helping him, not promoting herself, and that she was not offering voters two for the price of one.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'm not running for office,'' said Mrs. Bush, 53. ''George is running for office. I don't really even want to talk about issues that much. I'm not that knowledgeable about most issues.''

  But their counterparts this time around, Tipper Gore and Laura Bush, seem to be more ambivalent recruits, as content in the background as in the foreground, yanked by their husbands' desires into races and places they might never have chosen for themselves.

  Mrs. Bush, an intensely private woman, shares none of her husband's showmanship or garrulousness; toward the end of an interview with her aboard his campaign plane, when the governor exuberantly jumped in to compete for the attention of the reporter seated beside her, she promptly turned away, pulled out several pieces of stationery and began writing thank-you notes to acquaintances.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  Mrs. Bush says that contrast is one reason that their union, both personally and politically, works well.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But both she and her husband's advisers seem unsure at times of how exactly to cast Mrs. Bush's degree of reserve.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On one hand, they clearly see her detachment from the messier, more vainglorious dimensions of politics as an advantage: evidence to support her husband's assertion that he, too, is a grounded, down-to-earth person not driven by an insatiable ego or a partisan blood lust. The way Mr. Bush praised her in a recent interview was telling.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''She cuts right through, through the posturing and positioning,'' Mr. Bush said proudly. ''America's starved for something. I'm telling you: they're starved for something real. And that's what she brings. She's a real person.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On the other hand, the Bush campaign also does not want to present her as a bashful throwback or blandly dutiful helpmate -- an inaccurate portrait that might not play well with female swing voters and that decidedly sells Mrs. Bush short.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In interviews with other journalists in the past, Mrs. Bush readily called herself shy, but she now emphatically rejects that label. Some of her friends go out of their way to do likewise. It is as if they all received the same memo.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And an expression of distaste swept over her face recently when a New York Times reporter brought up a story, which had appeared elsewhere in print, that she had once answered a question from Mr. Bush's paternal grandmother about what she did with her life by saying, ''I read, I smoke and I admire.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''That's totally made up,'' Laura Bush said. ''I'm sure I said 'I read.' But I certainly didn't say 'I admire.' '' (As for smoking, Mrs. Bush eventually quit.)
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000

  But Barbara Bush said in a recent interview that she remembered both her daughter-in-law's three-part answer and her mother-in-law's reaction.
 </textdata>

  ''Mrs. Bush darn near collapsed,'' Barbara Bush said, recalling the response of the former president's mother.

  In truth, Laura Bush had a busy professional life as an elementary school teacher and librarian for a decade before she began dating George W. Bush, and she remained single, without pangs of worry, longer than any of her close female friends. She was 31 when she and Mr. Bush married in November 1977, three months after they met.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Her avidity for reading is really an abiding love of literature, and when she and Mr. Bush were living in Dallas in the 1980's and raising their two daughters, Mrs. Bush, who had given up her career around the time of her wedding, used her spare hours to take classes on William Faulkner, Greek tragedy and other literary topics.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  During the Republican primaries earlier this year, she was on a Truman Capote binge, but had to interrupt it because she found herself in the middle of ''In Cold Blood'' just as Mr. Bush lost the New Hampshire contest to Senator John McCain of Arizona.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It's so foreboding,'' Mrs. Bush said of Mr. Capote's masterwork, ''and I was reading it during the most anxiety-provoking time and I had to quit.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Bush also has a sassy streak that gets scant attention.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Years ago, Mr. Bush occasionally joked in public speeches that his wife had a librarian's narrow concept of oratory, and it amounted to a single syllable: ''Shhhh!'' Mrs. Bush was not amused.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And she has an adventurous impulse: for both her 40th and 50th birthdays, she went river rafting with four or her closest female friends, including a Democratic state senator in Kansas and a midwife in San Francisco who recently visited Indonesia to teach classes on childbirth. Around Austin, Mrs. Bush maintains a similarly eclectic mix of social acquaintances.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Relatives and friends say that Mr. Bush often solicits her advice, asking for her gut read on people and situations, and she serves as his filter for much of what is written about him in newspapers and magazines, which she seems to monitor more closely than he does. He often tells reporters not what he thought of their articles, but what she did.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I would never say to George, for something that he really wanted to do, that he couldn't do that,'' Mrs. Bush said, adding that he, too, would never deny her something that she deemed important. People who know the couple well have said that his decision to quit drinking 14 years ago was partly a response to her entreaties and to a growing worry that he was endangering his marriage and family life, which he cherished.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Bush said that her own family life had been a stable and deeply loving one. She grew up as an only child in Midland, where her father, Harold B. Welch, was a successful home builder and her mother, Jenna Welch, kept his books. Although neither of her parents had finished college, they let Laura know early on that they expected her to go, and she was a conscientious, excellent student who never got into trouble.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  She and Mr. Bush, who also grew up in Midland, went to different elementary schools but were in the seventh grade together at the same middle school, although neither of them remembers knowing the other very well. She stayed in Midland while he went to Philips Academy in Andover, Mass., and she and her friends described her high school years as happy and generally uneventful.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000

 <textdata>
  But one day in 1963, when she was 17, she drove through a stop sign and hit another car. Its occupant, a boy who happened to be a close friend, was killed in the collision, which was deemed an accident; no charges were filed against her. Mrs. Bush said that she was steeled for the incident to come up during her husband's presidential campaign, as it did earlier this year, but she nonetheless tensed at the mention of it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After getting a master's degree in library science from the University of Texas in 1973, she settled in Austin, where she worked as an elementary school librarian. She said that she never wanted for dates but had not found the right man until, in the summer of 1977, she paid a fateful visit to Midland, where Mr. Bush was making his way in the oil business. A couple who knew them both invited them over for a backyard barbecue.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush talked and talked. Laura Welch listened and listened. The next night, he took her out for a game of miniature golf. And soon after that they said ''I do.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Adjustments were necessary. She was persuaded to make her first political speech the next year, when he waged his unsuccessful campaign for Congress. He learned to conform to her standards for tidiness and order, which were so high that one of her friends, Jan O'Neill, recalled that Mrs. Bush organized the books in the couple's bedroom in accordance with the Dewey decimal system.

  At Bush family gatherings, she made an unusual addition to the sometimes rambunctious clan. Her husband recalled his parents and siblings sitting around the table in Kennebunkport, Me., their plates clean, while they watched and waited patiently for his wife to pick her way through her meal.

  The couple wanted a large family of their own, tried for several years without success, and had already begun the adoption process when Mrs. Bush learned that she was finally pregnant with fraternal twins. Even then, the outlook was uncertain; she developed toxemia, and her doctor told her that she would be lucky to deliver one healthy child. Mrs. Bush said that whenever she went to the grocery store, she avoided the aisle with diapers and baby-related items, because she did not want to stoke her hopes.

  She says she has not given extensive thought to what kind of first lady she might make, but her mother-in-law has some ideas. Barbara Bush said her daughter-in-law would be different from Hillary Clinton because she would ''not get into foreign affairs or controversial subjects.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I think she would rather make a positive impact on the country,'' Barbara Bush said. ''And I'm not criticizing Mrs. Clinton. But it's like oil and water. We're talking about two different subjects. They're two different people. I think Laura thinks of others.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  She also said her daughter-in-law would be ''better, much better'' in the role than she was. ''She won't be a fat, white-haired old lady,'' Barbara Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  She would also be less voluble, and in many ways less accessible, because there are tight boundaries around what Laura Bush is willing to offer for public consumption.
 </textdata>

  The gesture was easy to miss, as she clearly intended it to be. Campaign or no campaign, Laura Bush was not about to share her tears.

  The majority of delegates assembling here today to nominate Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for president are notably conservative in thought and spirit, even at a time when Mr. Bush has sought to portray the Republican Party as increasingly moderate, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates.

  The majority of delegates assembling here today to nominate Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for president are notably conservative in thought and spirit, even at a time when Mr. Bush has sought to portray the Republican Party as increasingly moderate, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  While Mr. Bush has sought for much of this year to distinguish himself from his party's conservative wing and history, most delegates interviewed today considered him conservative, if not necessarily as conservative as they considered themselves.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They are also, overwhelmingly, enthusiastic about the qualifications and political skills of the man they will nominate for president on Thursday night, and confident about his chances against Vice President Al Gore in November.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The party has a conservative wing and a moderate wing and both sides are comfortable with him,'' Eric Melgren, a delegate from Kansas, said of Mr. Bush. ''Republicans are hungry enough that there is, to at least some degree, things that are all willing to overlook.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The finding in The Times/CBS poll, as well as in follow-up interviews conducted today with delegates, suggested one of the tasks Mr. Bush faces this week: Convincing independents and moderate Democrats, in particular, that his is the face of the Republican Party, rather than of the delegates who will be celebrating his nomination.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For much of this campaign, Mr. Bush has sought to draw some distance between himself and conservatives in the party -- and, it seems, he has paid little price for that among the Republicans here.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In contrast to surveys of rank-and-file Republican voters, the poll of the delegates found that they were more apt to describe Mr. Bush as conservative. In a tribute to his political skills, delegates who described themselves as moderates viewed him as one, too, while self-described conservatives called him conservative.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Georgia Buxton, a delegate from Maine who described herself as moderate, offered this description of Mr. Bush: ''I see him as a moderate with some conservative areas.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, this year's poll suggested a wide disparity between voters and delegates at a time when Mr. Bush has been trying to pull the party to the center as Republicans seek to win the White House for the first time since 1988.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although the delegates were overwhelmingly opposed to abortion rights, only 2 in 10 said that Mr. Bush would consider the issue when choosing judges for nomination to the Supreme Court.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Jan Howard, 48, a delegate from California, said that Mr. Bush's views of government closely hewed to her own.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Finally, reflecting the spirit of the occasion, the delegates viewed Mr.  Bush's candidacy with enthusiasm -- indeed, with more enthusiasm than had been voiced by registered Republicans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Forty-two percent of Mr. Bush's supporters across the nation said they supported him with reservations. Only four percent of the delegates said they felt the same way.

  As he rides toward his moment of triumph, George W. Bush speaks with extra punch. He belts out his speeches now, his face flushing, arms waving. Yet once off the stage, he is unusually introspective, talking of family. History. Legacy.

 <textdata>
  So confident is he that he jokes fondly about his new running mate's flat campaign style, calling it with notable understatement ''a little more laid-back than mine.'' And though usually allergic to pyschobabble, Mr. Bush does not brush off questions about his relationship with his father, former President George H. W. Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It wasn't all that long ago that he himself was the president of the United States, which will make the story unique and different,'' Mr. Bush mused.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There is poignancy to this conversation on the plane. At his rallies, Mr. Bush speaks of his popular mother. He revels in telling the tale of his courtship of his wife, Laura. But the only acknowledgment of his father is oblique.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Now the Bush clan is gathering once again, just as it did to watch the father's triumphant nomination by two Republican National Conventions. This time it is the eldest son who will take his moment on the stage, capping a remarkable 17-month transformation from a governor with less than two full terms in office to his party's great hope to reclaim the White House.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''They'll be there, sure, I think all of my brothers and sister,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I can't think of any boycotters.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Day after day as Mr. Bush gets closer to Philadelphia, the pyrotechnics become more elaborate. Today he stole a technique from his primary rival John McCain and showed up on a campaign bus for a rally here at the replica of the historic Crosley Field. Fireworks shot into the sky to dazzle the crowd of 2,000, who had waited for hours on the open field despite several pelting rainstorms.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a blue shirt and no jacket, dancing on his heels, Mr. Bush spoke of himself in the third person. ''You got to understand about George W.,'' he said. ''I don't take polls to tell me what to think. I do what I think is right.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush seems serene, though at times emotional too. At the governor's mansion in Austin late last week, he almost choked up when he said he would recognize his wife, his daughters and his parents in his convention speech.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Bush is at his side at rally after rally, beaming, as he weaves her into his stump speech by promoting her own convention speech, planned for Monday night. ''The first speaker will be the first lady of the state of Texas,'' he tells his audiences.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So the Republican convention will be about Mr. Bush and the Bush family and the Bush platform, beginning in prime time on Monday with Laura and ending Thursday night with Mr. Bush's acceptance speech. ''That puts the Bush family arms around the convention,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Not that the edge is gone completely. Revving up the drenched crowd before Mr. Bush's arrival today, Bill Cunningham, the host of a local radio talk show, asked, ''Are we going to permit an eighth of an inch of rain to keep us from scouring out the White House from the filth and degradation of Clinton-Gore?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's speeches by contrast have few hard edges, except for his promise to restore ''honor and dignity'' to the presidency and the dig at President Clinton that is implicit when he says Dick Cheney ''understands what the definition of 'is' is.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Sometimes he sounds more like a revivalist preacher than a politician. Before 5,000 people in Joplin, Mo., on Friday night, Mr. Bush thundered: ''My administration will rally what I call the armies of compassion, the decent, kindhearted souls that act not because of government, that act because they hear our call to people all across America.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And under the confetti and the balloons, and on outdoor stages, Mr. Bush throws out his arms maniacally to give oomph to the old familiar stump speech. He gets help in looking animated by way of the contrast with his new running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On his one day of campaigning with Mr. Bush last Friday, Mr. Cheney shook hands fast along the receiving line waiting to greet the Bush plane. Then he stood all alone at the waiting car. Mr. Bush was still working the line, grabbing a hand here, a shoulder there.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''We have a different campaigning style,'' Mr. Bush said the next day. ''That's the way it is. He's going to be a great partner. He's warming up.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And if these are glory days, well, Mr. Bush says he learned something else from his father, who watched his sky-high approval ratings after the gulf war collapse, leaving him unable to stave off defeat in 1992 by a young, untested governor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Gov. George W. Bush's vice-presidential choice, Mr. Cheney, was on  ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, ''Face the Nation'' on CBS, ''This Week'' on ABC, ''Fox News Sunday'' and ''Late Edition With Wolf Blitzer'' on CNN (which bills itself as ''the last word in Sunday talk,'' would that it were true).
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Displaying none of the puppy-dog enthusiasm that former Vice President Dan Quayle exhibited when chosen by Governor Bush's father in 1988, Mr. Cheney was an ostentatiously subdued presence in his marathon of interviews.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''This is exactly the sort of thing we've seen in the Gore campaign,'' Mr. Cheney told the host of ''Meet the Press,'' Tim Russert. ''Attack, attack.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Face the Nation'' had what it called an ''exclusive'' talk with Senator John McCain, Governor Bush's chief opponent in the primaries (although Mr. McCain had already been heard from on Sunday morning's edition of ''Today'').
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Some had wondered, somewhat optimistically, whether Mr. McCain would enliven the otherwise cut-and-dried convention by saying something intemperate, but he made it clear he would be a good boy. ''Governor Bush has been running exactly the sort of campaign I would be running,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Laura Bush will discuss the importance of literacy issues.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You want people to come away with the feeling that Governor Bush is going to do things a little bit differently,'' said Russell Schriefer, a Bush media consultant who has been working on the convention videos and programs for months.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The convention's program is another reflection of the lock-step approach to message management. On Monday night, for instance, when the focus on the stage turns to education issues, so will the satellite feed to three jumbo Liquid Crystal Display screens. The image of Gov. George W. Bush, speaking live at a school event in Ohio, will be beamed into the First Union Center. On Tuesday,  when the program calls for talk of defense policy -- and a speech by a war hero, Senator John McCain of Arizona -- Mr. Bush is again to appear by satellite, from a site brimming with military symbolism: Gettysburg, Pa.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The thrust is not universally appreciated. Among others, Richard Lowry, the editor of the National Review, a conservative journal, appeared on CNN the other night to express disappointment that the issues of the day are being shoved out of the television picture. And Democrats are clearly trying to cloud the upbeat focus on Mr. Bush with a 17-state advertising campaign criticizing the Congressional voting record of his running mate, Dick Cheney.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Republicans who have been pushing for a mainstream appeal seem buoyant. ''An inclusive message is a winning message,'' said Mark Miller, executive director of the Republican Leadership Council, a centrist group based in Washington. Even a former adversary, Greg Stevens, who was Mr. McCain's media consultant during the primaries, said that he was impressed by how faithfully the Bush camp had tried to marry Mr. Bush's personal style to the convention's themes.
 </textdata>

  Conservative Delegates Test Bush's Moderation  The majority of Republican delegates assembling in Philadelphia to nominate Gov. George W. Bush for president are notably conservative in thought and spirit, even at a time when Mr. Bush has sought to portray his party as increasingly moderate, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates. On issues from affirmative action to environmental concerns to abortion, the poll found that delegates stand significantly to the right of much of the nation, and even to the right of rank-and-file Republican voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-31-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Senator John McCain was booed in Philadelphia by the sort of audience he usually enraptures, an uneasy assortment of the disgruntled -- critics of the campaign finance system, politics-as-usual and much else -- gathered for a ''shadow convention.'' The booing came after the senator endorsed Mr. Bush, the man he had once derided as a phony reformer unprepared for the Oval Office.

  The ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney is generating even greater enthusiasm in the business world and corporate donors have helped put the Republican Party in the best financial shape it has ever enjoyed going into a general election.
 </textdata>

  To capitalize on the popularity of Mr. Bush, the second-term Texas governor, the party has created a new level of top givers -- the Regents, individuals and companies who have given the party at least $250,000 since January 1999. As of July 1, the Republican Party had more than 100 such donors, who will be rewarded at the convention with skybox seats, private dinners with party leaders, Champagne receptions and deluxe hotel accommodations (most of the Regents are staying at the Four Seasons). A few will be going on a fishing trip with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
 </textdata>

  During the four-day convention, television cameras will focus on the stage where Mr. Bush will accept his party's presidential nomination and other party figures will speak. But much of the convention's real business will take place off-camera in hotel suites, hospitality tents, restaurants and country clubs where donors will be rewarded for past generosity and asked to give again.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  For the party's top underwriters, there will be an array of gold-plated events in Philadelphia, including  cocktails with Gen. Colin L. Powell and an evening cruise on the Delaware River aboard the ''Enterprise,'' the yacht owned by Richard M. DeVos, the Amway founder, who is a Bush supporter.

  Mr. Bush has excited the corporate world more than any recent Republican presidential nominee,  party leaders say. His running mate, Mr. Cheney, the former defense secretary who until his selection was the chairman and chief executive officer of the Halliburton Company, the world's largest oil field services company, also generates enthusiasm in corporate boardrooms.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Already, Mr. Bush's campaign has collected a record $90 million in federally restricted, individual donations of $1,000 or less; nearly one-quarter of that amount was raised by a national network of 212 business executives and wealthy individuals who call themselves the Pioneers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's proposal for a deep tax cut and his record of passing legislation to limit civil lawsuits in Texas are extremely appealing to the Republican Party's major underwriters. Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore's environmental views, among other issues, make some donors in the business community nervous.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Democrats, of course, will be giving royal treatment to their largest donors at their convention in Los Angeles, too, with labor unions, trial lawyers and Hollywood executives among the biggest underwriters of the Democratic ticket. But the Democratic Party is struggling to compete with Mr. Bush and the Republican Party in America's corporate suites.

  ''Our fund-raising success is a measure of the broad and deep support that our party, its principles and our nominee -- Gov. George W. Bush -- have across this great land,'' Mr. Pascoe said.

  The companies and the individuals who make up the list of top contributors to the Republican National Committee say they are delighted by Mr.  Bush's rhetoric and his record.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Perhaps most important, Mr. Bush supports limits on damages in product liability lawsuits and on fees for trial lawyers and opposes federal anti-tobacco litigation. In Texas, he was also responsible for a $1.7 billion property tax break and environmental waivers for the oil and energy industries and has opposed most gun control legislation and government lawsuits against gun manufacturers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I am not sympathetic to lawsuits,'' Mr. Bush said at a campaign stop in Washington State in February. ''Write that down. I worry about lawsuits on job creation. If you are looking for the kind of president I will be, I will be slow to litigate.''

  A spokesman for Philip Morris, the Republican committee's largest single donor at $619,000 as of June 30, said that the company supports Republicans because they are ''people who share similar views on issues that are important,'' including the regulation of tobacco. Another industry official said he expected that Mr. Bush would treat cigarette companies fairly, while President Clinton has used the industry as a whipping boy.

  Few companies have as much at stake in November's election as Enron, the giant Houston energy and trading concern that, over the years, has been Governor Bush's largest corporate sponsor as well as a generous soft-money donor to the Republican Party. Enron and its chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay,  have been the top patrons of Mr. Bush's political career since his first campaign for Congress in 1978. Since January 1999, Enron and its executives have donated $615,550 to the Republican National Committee, the second-highest amount of any individual or corporation in that period.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush's tenure in Texas has been beneficial to Enron: he backed several of the company's most important legislative initiatives, including electric utility deregulation and  limits on civil lawsuits.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Enron is even more explicit about why it wants to see Mr. Bush and other Republicans elected in November. A June 15 internal memorandum to executives soliciting contributions to the company's political action committee lays out the reasons: Enron faces numerous legal and regulatory challenges, the memorandum says, including taxation of electronic commerce, restructuring of the electric industry, international trade legislation, regulation of power plants and oil pipelines and a variety of environmental and tax issues.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  A Democratic Enron employee who received the letter said some employees found the solicitation objectionable. The employee also said that some employees have begun to complain that too many corporate resources are being spent to support Mr. Bush's campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''The wholehearted endorsement of Governor Bush, and the brazen use of the corporate machinery to ensure his election, seems distasteful,'' said the employee, who insisted on anonymity.

  Mr. Bush opposed state and federal lawsuits against gun makers  and supported the N.R.A.'s version of a bill to require background checks at gun shows. In the House, Mr. Cheney was a staunch ally of gun owners.

  Sam Wyly and his brother, Charles J. Wyly Jr., longtime friends of Mr.  Bush, are among the most generous individual underwriters of the Republican Party. They have supported Mr. Bush not only with $500,000 in donations to the party but also with a $2.5 million television advertising campaign against his rival in the Republican primaries Senator John McCain of Arizona last winter.
 </textdata>

  7-30-2000

  Sam Wyly's businesses have fared well during Mr. Bush's tenure as Texas governor. Two years ago, one of the Wyly firms, Maverick Capital, won a state contract to manage $96 million of the University of Texas endowment fund.

  Gov. George W. Bush swung through another battleground state today, proclaiming that the days of Republican losses were over. ''We haven't won Kentucky lately,'' he thundered, ''but that's going to change come November.''

  Mr. Bush promised to bring a new tone to Washington as he crisscrossed Kentucky on the second day of his march to the Republican National Convention. He drew large crowds, despite downpours and drizzle, with people lined up under umbrellas to shake his hand.

  ''If you're sick of the politics of personal destruction, there's a place for you in this campaign,'' Mr. Bush shouted to an audience that crammed into an airport hangar in Owensboro and spilled out into the rain-drenched tarmac. ''If you want somebody to unite the nation, there's a place for you in this campaign.''

  As Mr. Bush made his way to the convention, gone were his usual small-panel discussions. All across Kentucky, he revved up the kinds of rally crowds not seen since the height of the Republican primaries. Balloons fell. American flags unfurled. Confetti dropped. Rock music blared. And streamers were shot to the rafters. The only thing that went wrong was the breakdown of a backup press plane.

  ''I'm pleased by the energy level,'' Mr. Bush told reporters on his campaign plane. He said the audiences were ''like the crowd you'd expect on the last days of the campaign.''

  The perils of that approach were on display today when Chris Payne, an employee of a grain company, dressed in his work clothes, kept forgetting his lines as he was introducing Mr. Bush. Several times he stopped midsentence and had to pull a written speech from his pocket.

 <textdata>
  ''I'm sorry. I'm not a public speaker,'' Mr. Payne said. He then said of Mr. Bush, ''He trusts you and me to make the best decisions,'' which was supposed to be an endorsement for Mr. Bush's plan to divert some of the Social Security payroll tax to individual investment accounts.

  Mr. Bush took pains to assure older people that his Social Security plan would not affect them but only affect younger workers. ''I want the elderly here in this audience to hear me loud and clear,'' he said. ''Don't be fooled by that kind of politics where they're going to get on your TV screen and try to scare you.''

  ''George W. Bush,'' he said, ''will keep the promise to the elderly in America.''

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush also fired up audiences with talk of tax cuts, though he did not explicitly mention his plan to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion over a decade. ''You see, I happen to think the surplus means government has more money than it needs,'' he said to cheers. ''I happen to know that one of the reasons we have a surplus is that the taxes on the people that are working hard are the highest they've been since World War II.

  A small crowd of protesters opposed to the death penalty read aloud the names of people executed in Texas and chanted, ''Killed by Bush.'' But they were far outnumbered by Bush supporters. Mr. Bush shouted louder into the microphones, and the sound system mostly drowned out the demonstrators.

  By the time he arrives at the convention on Wednesday morning, Mr. Bush will have passed through three other states that voted for President Clinton in the last two elections -- Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

  The Democrats also say they expect to use the issue to underscore sharp ideological differences between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, supports an array of tougher gun laws, while Mr. Bush, the likely Republican candidate, opposes most new gun restrictions and has been a strong ally of the N.R.A.

  Consider this summer's national party conventions, starting tomorrow when the Republicans meet in Philadelphia. The only woman presidential hopeful crashed long ago (Elizabeth Dole), and no woman has been on either George W. Bush's or Al Gore's short list of likely running mates for months. It's revealing that 16 years after Geraldine A. Ferraro became the first woman to run for vice president on a major party ticket, she has had no successor. Her troubled race hardly inspired imitation. But there are more fundamental reasons for the paucity of female heavy hitters in politics. It's because of who we are.

  Women are forced to prove themselves in ways men are not. ''Everybody assumes that George Bush is going to be tough on criminals. I have to prove that I'm going to be tough,'' Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas, observes. ''You see the difference? And being tough doesn't ring any bell with women voters.'' A no-win. Same for politics and families. It's quite the irony that the average male politician parades his wife and children, while ''women always campaign alone,'' Senator Dianne Feinstein of California notes; most political husbands have independent careers and avoid the campaign trail. The book shows how rough women are on one another -- the first to complain (usually to a man) when another woman falters, and rarely willing to put sisterhood ahead of politics.

  You have to wonder too whether all the anxiety about lost skills and summer slumps -- Learning Takes No Vacation: How Parents Can Help Kids Overcome What Educators Call the Summer Slide'' warns a headline in a recent parenting magazine -- isn't a little overwrought, and when it comes to middle-class families, a little misplaced. (A 1996 study showed the loss of reading skills over the summer months varied with socioeconomic status; children of poor families lost the most while those of middle-class families held steady or improved.) Perhaps affluent older parents imagine their children's brains are like theirs, finite spaces out of which 70's song lyrics must be moved to make room for new Web browsing skills, say, or George W. Bush's campaign promises. I hear my husband and me telling our 4-year-old what a good memory he has, and hear not just our positive reinforcement, but slightly jealous admiration. If we took the summer off, sure, we would forget a lot. But we are not 4, or 8, or 14.

  Mr. Bush is trying hard to reach out to Hispanics and other immigrants, recognizing that the Republican Party has an anti-immigrant image among many voters. Over all, the passages on immigration are more welcoming and inclusive than in the platform from four years ago.

  Lazio's air of perpetual youth is not only a matter of looks. He is one of those people who goes through life with the brightness knob turned all the way up; he has George W. Bush's high spirits, but without his sardonic smirk or ironic wit. Lazio has a way of booming ''Good morning!'' -- even to a pack of reporters waiting to jump down his throat -- that puts you in mind of a visitor to an elementary school class. During a farm breakfast he attended late last month, he was given some milk from one of those little cartons that kids get at school. ''Where's Pat?'' he cried, looking around for his wife. ''This is great! She should try some of this.''

 <textdata>
  Still, the bill that finally emerged from this agonizing and dilatory process was widely welcomed. The administration took credit for the bill, and so did Lazio. Indeed, Lazio held a news conference that revealed how very high the stakes had been for the Republican leadership. Standing with Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, Lazio declared, ''Who says the Republicans don't have an urban policy?''Rick Lazio's distinguishing feature may well be audacity. He's not audacious in the way of, say, Peter King, who openly criticizes his own party and ensures himself thereby an almost unlimited supply of press attention. Lazio is not, God knows, gadfly material. He is, rather, audacious in a way that is perfectly in keeping with his genial, unobtrusive nature, his modest gifts and his single-minded focus on the goal before him. Though his temperament in many ways resembles that of George W. Bush, it is well to keep in mind that Lazio's father supplied him with far fewer advantages in life than did Bush's. Lazio has had to succeed on his own, and because his native talents are scarcely outsize, it is his ambition that has seen him through. Lazio has always been something of an upstart; it took an upstart's moxie to run against Tom Downey, to slug it out with Speaker Foley, to hold up the legislative process while he quarreled with the upper house. And if Lazio weren't audacious, he wouldn't be running right now.

  Indeed, Lazio may succeed in parrying Hillary Clinton's ideological thrusts and still be left with questions about his character. This seems odd, since character would appear to be precisely what has taken Lazio so far. But that's not quite right; Lazio's great gift -- and George W.'s, too -- is not character but personality. Lazio, like Bush, is an ingratiating fellow, modest and friendly, universally welcoming. He seems genuinely to live inside his sugary aphorisms. But voters tend to reserve the word ''character'' to describe how a candidate behaves at moments of difficulty. It's not enough, and perhaps not even necessary, for the people we elect to be good children to their parents and good parents to their children. They have to make hard choices; and Lazio, the man who admires Dick Armey and Robert Wagner, may still have something to prove in that regard.

  This summer, as we approach the Republican and Democratic conventions, both major presidential candidates have conducted highly structured searches for their running mates. Richard Cheney, the former secretary of defense, has spent months vetting candidates for George W. Bush. Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher has been doing the same for Al Gore.

  Though it was only 20 years ago, the process in 1980 could not have been more different from the one today. It is hard to imagine an unexpected vice-presidential pick at the last minute, like John Kennedy's selection of Lyndon Johnson in 1960, Richard Nixon's choice of Spiro Agnew in 1968 or even George Bush Sr.'s elevation of Dan Quayle in 1988 -- all of which caught the candidates' advisers by surprise.

  But it was Ronald Reagan's nomination of Governor Bush's father that bears special telling. Reagan's selection of Bush in Detroit represented a turnabout within six hours; it came only when the negotiations with Ford, having taken on a life of their own, appeared to have reached an impasse. Had the talks succeeded and had Ford been selected, the Reagan campaign, crippled by infighting, might well have lost to the Carter-Mondale ticket in the fall. Had Reagan and Ford managed to win the election, it's very likely that their administration would have been hobbled by an unworkable power-sharing arrangement. It's also possible that the Republicans might have a different candidate today.
 </textdata>

  There are many plausible versions of how and why Reagan chose George Bush as his running mate, but most are wide of the mark. One conventional view is that Reagan, about to be nominated, recognized that he ''needed a moderate'' like Bush to balance the ticket; another version has it that Reagan, supposedly unschooled in foreign affairs, saw the wisdom of naming someone with extensive experience in the field to offset his own shortcomings. Yet another explanation holds that Reagan, a Californian, needed ''geographic balance'' and got that in Bush, with his Connecticut and Texas lineage.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  These explanations are wrong. George Bush was picked at the very last moment and largely by a combination of chance and some behind-the-scenes maneuvering. Many Reagan advisers have claimed a deal was never close. The post-convention media commentary has largely reflected this view. In fact, Meese and Deaver have gone so far as to declare that Bush was their first choice all along. I take exception to their account. I saw a very different story unfold, and saw it from a privileged vantage point. From the moment I walked into that suite until the moment Bush was finally selected, I was the only person to remain in Reagan's presence throughout the adventure. With detailed notes to back up my memory, this is what I saw at the dawn of the Reagan Revolution on that long night in Detroit.

  Ronald Reagan's search for a vice president started as soon as he clinched the nomination with a string of primary victories in the spring of 1980. Before long, a short list of prospective running mates had been put together, including Howard Baker, William Simon, Jack Kemp, Richard Lugar, Paul Laxalt and George Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This was serious. And so I did something rash: I decided to try to contact George Bush. Until that moment, the campaign inner circle had treated important issues in a collegial manner; there had been no secrets among us. But on this issue, Casey, Meese, Wirthlin and Deaver were keeping the lid on. If my colleagues could play it close to the vest on such a crucial issue, it was a game that could be played by others as well.
 </textdata>

  Although nominally still on a list of frequently mentioned running mates, George Bush was not really on Reagan's radar screen. Since the primaries, the two men had barely spoken, and they certainly hadn't discussed the vice presidency. Apart from serious policy differences, Bush had refused to admit defeat in the primary battles despite being vanquished by Reagan in 29 of 33 primaries and did not withdraw from the race until just before the California primary in June. Reagan considered the belated departure willful and unnecessary and was offended by it. Still, I thought Bush a viable alternative to Ford; he had the best credentials of the possible running mates mentioned. If not for the unsettled relations between the two, Bush could bring more to the ticket to help Reagan than anyone on the list of choices.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There was no question that a Bush candidacy would be a hard sell. Among Reagan's advisers, Nofziger and Casey viewed Bush as a liberal, and others were almost unanimously against him, some even contemptuous. I considered Bush a capable man whose positions were actually much closer to Reagan's than were Ford's, especially on foreign policy and defense matters. In 1978, Bush had requested my assistance on his campaign, but my commitment to Reagan was firm. Of the Reagan inner circle, I had the clearest channel to Bush and knew him the best.

  Shortly before 7:30, I reached Stefan Halper, a Bush aide. Talking to him from the nearly empty suite, I asked him, in as circumspect a manner as possible, to seek Bush's assurance that he could support the platform ''with no exceptions.'' Halper knew what I meant: Was Bush interested in the job? Would he implicitly abandon his support for abortion and his opposition to supply-side economics by embracing the platform? I then called an old friend, Richard Fairbanks, to ask him to approach Bush with the same question. I wanted two sources of independent confirmation and knew Fairbanks was close to Bush.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There's Bush,'' I suggested, half expecting him to close off the discussion. Instead, he paused and then said, ''I can't take him; that 'voodoo economic policy' charge and his stand on abortion are wrong.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Sensing an opportunity, I reached for a copy of the platform lying on the coffee table, passed it to him and said, ''Governor, this is your platform, every word of it.'' I added that Martin Anderson, Reagan's chief domestic policy adviser, Peter Hannaford and I had scrutinized it carefully. ''If you could be assured that George Bush would support this platform in every detail,'' I asked, ''would you reconsider Bush?''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At 7:50 Fairbanks called to say that Bush could indeed embrace the platform; soon thereafter, Halper phoned with the same message. Meanwhile, negotiations with Ford continued upstairs on the 70th floor, with Casey, Meese, Deaver and Wirthlin representing Reagan, and Greenspan, Kissinger and the Ford advisers John O. Marsh, Robert Barrett representing the former president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Seeing another opening, I then informed Reagan that Bush had given unequivocal assurances that he could embrace and defend the entire platform, emphasizing ''with no exceptions.'' He listened carefully, but did not respond. I simply could not read his reaction, and the thought crossed my mind that he was angry that I had opened a channel to Bush.

  Just before 11, Nancy Reagan and the Reagan children came in to watch the convention roll call. At 11:13, Montana put Reagan over the top, and there was jubilation. At the moment of triumph, though, the negotiators were not present; they remained upstairs, locked in discussions. Meanwhile, the convention was drawing to a close -- if the Ford talks went on much longer, and failed, there would be no way to heal the disappointment. Over the course of the preceding hour, I had told Hannaford, Anderson and Nofziger that a channel had been opened to Bush and that Bush was on board with the platform. Hannaford then began to argue that the logjam had to be broken. He collected Deaver and Nofziger at the entrance to the suite and mounted the stairs to tell the negotiators that a decision was needed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Reagan glanced around and asked those assembled -- a group that included Casey, Meese, Wirthlin, Hannaford, Deaver and me -- Well, what do we do now?'' There was no immediate response. No one offered an alternate plan. No one tossed out a name. Expecting instant opposition, I ventured, ''We call Bush.'' Once more, silence. Reagan again looked at each of us; hearing no objection, he said, ''Well, let's get Bush on the phone.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At precisely 11:38, the phone was in Reagan's hand; though they barely knew each other, Reagan dove right in. ''George,'' he said warmly, ''I would like to go over there and tell them that I am recommending you for vice president. Could I ask you one thing -- do I have your permission to make an announcement that you support the platform across the board?'' We could hear Bush agreeing at the other end. Reagan then left for the convention center where, shortly after midnight, he took the podium to praise Ford and then to announce his running mate, George Bush.

  Ten photographs in Richard L. Berke's article (July 9) were worth one million words. They're all white men! Al Gore cannot hope to be the first president elected in the 21st century if he's still practicing the politics of the 18th. It is preposterous to suggest that not one woman or person of color merits consideration to be the nominee for vice president. If his campaign continues to demonstrate this lack of imagination, Gore is guaranteed a trip home in January.

  It is somewhat unusual for a presidential candidate to announce in advance when he is going to announce his choice of a running mate. But the Gore campaign hopes to set up a stark contrast with what it perceives as the haphazard atmosphere of Gov. George W. Bush's selection of Dick Cheney. Mr. Gore's campaign spokesman, Chris Lehane, described that atmosphere as ''carnival-like.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By setting a date for the announcement, Gore aides said they hoped that voters would perceive Mr. Gore as making this  decision in a mature, methodical manner -- and, by extension, that they would perceive Mr. Bush as not ready to occupy the Oval Office.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Karen P. Hughes, chief spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, criticized the announcement. ''Once again, everything is a political calculation,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''They are more concerned about the political timing of the announcement instead of who the person will be.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The announcement is scheduled for Nashville, where Mr. Gore's headquarters are. The new ticket will then almost certainly head to the running mate's home state. From there the two will travel through the battleground states, separating at some point. Mr. Gore is not scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles until Wednesday, Aug. 16, two days after the convention opens. Just before then, he will conduct a ''passing of the torch'' ceremony with President Clinton so that Mr. Gore can enter Los Angeles as his own man.

  For his part, Mr. Gore said today during a walk on the beach with his family that he had still not settled on a running mate, although he has given strong indications that he is close to a decision. He told reporters earlier that there were fewer than 10 people on his list; the list is believed to be much smaller than that.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000

  Asked if he had made his choice, Mr. Gore said today, ''Not yet, we're just having a good time.'' Aides said he had been swimming and working on a jigsaw puzzle as he and his family began a weeklong vacation at the five-bedroom seaside home of Parker and Becky Overton, the Greenville couple who own a sporting goods business and have been longtime friends of the Gores.

  Mr. Gore told reporters as he flew here  that he was actively ''mulling'' his choice but would probably not reach a final decision until after he returned to Washington on Thursday. The ''mulling'' process itself is meant to contrast with what Gore aides characterize as a frantic scramble for Mr. Bush and an incomplete vetting of Mr. Cheney that left him unprepared for an immediate assault from Democrats on his voting record.

  As they critique the Cheney choice, they focus on two things. They say that Mr. Cheney is a ''retro'' candidate from the past and that ''the visuals'' -- of an older white man with a history of heart trouble -- hurt Mr. Bush. The suggestion is that Mr. Gore will pick someone young and fresh and that the pictures of the two together will immediately convey a positive sense of vigor and energy. Mr. Gore is almost certainly guided by the instant lift his own selection gave Bill Clinton in 1992.

  ''You want the first thing people say to be positive and be something you can build on,'' one Gore strategist said. ''That's the problem Bush has been having -- they've been on the defensive the whole week. You want the kickoff to be something powerful that carries you for the first 48 to 72 hours. This issue stuff is hurting Cheney. What's left is the picture.''

  Rather than go for a niche candidate who would help with a specific state or a specific group, Mr. Gore is believed to be seeking someone who would reinforce his own strengths in much the way that he reinforced Mr. Clinton's. Both came from the South, the ideological center of the party and the same age group, and they proved that reinforcement rather than balance could be a winning formula.

  The 107-member platform committee voted against a call to abolish the Department of Education, and in favor of Mr. Bush's education principles, which conservatives had resisted in early subcommittee action. Bush allies termed both votes a major victory, emblematic of their candidate's efforts to create a new Republican Party with more appeal to the voters in the center. The platform will be considered by the full convention on Monday.

  Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, chairman of the committee, declared the document ''very visionary, very exciting,'' and a platform that Mr. Bush and other Republican candidates can run on comfortably.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, the tension between Mr. Bush's reach for the center on education, and the ideological pull of his party's base was apparent throughout debate during the morning. ''When you say the abolishment of the Department of Education,'' said Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, a Bush ally, what many people hear is ''that we don't care about education -- and if there's one thing Republicans care about, it's kids.''

  After the votes, a Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer, declared it a ''marked departure from the '96 platform,'' adding, ''We did make it clear to delegates that this was a crucial issue to Governor Bush.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  With only brief debate, the platform committee reasserted that ''homosexuality is incompatible with military service,'' overwhelmingly rejecting efforts to remove that plank. Mr. Fleischer noted that this was not Mr. Bush's position, adding, ''The governor believes 'don't ask, don't tell' is the appropriate policy and he supports that.''

  The power of conservatives was perhaps most clear on the issue of abortion. Long before the committee met, Mr. Bush and Republican leaders had announced that they wanted the abortion plank, which calls for a ban on abortion, left alone. Abortion rights supporters tried on several occasions to remove the plank or add a provision recognizing and expressing respect for Republicans who hold different views on the issue, but they were decisively beaten each time. They were struggling tonight to build support for a minority report on abortion, or to get a majority of six state delegations, the first step to bringing the issue to the floor.

  The committee's final action was the approval of a preamble that sounds the themes for the Bush campaign -- ''bold reforms in education,'' ''saving and strengthening Social Security,'' ''tax reforms that will sustain our nation's prosperity and reflect its decency.'' It also talks about a vision of ''a welcoming society,'' and then tries to strike the balance between reaching out and reaffirming core principles.

  The building at 255-265 McKibbin Street, home to Ms. Bick and Quality Knits, is in the midst of a transformation. For decades artists have been moving eastward along the L train, out of the East Village and into Williamsburg, in search of bigger spaces, lower rents and hipper neighborhoods. Now the artists have reached farther still, renting former manufacturing spaces around the fifth, sixth and seventh stops from Manhattan on the L train. Most of the new arrivals call the area East Williamsburg, but to longtime residents it is Bushwick.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  The artists colonizing the old industrial buildings on the western end of Bushwick say they believe that they are playing the role of pioneers. Crime is down in the area, as it is citywide, but many new residents have stories of break-ins and car thefts and have held meetings recently to discuss a series of muggings.
 </textdata>

  Unlike Williamsburg or the East Village, the fifth subway stop has  no cafes in which residents can gather, but the new arrivals have organized a summer film festival and studio tours. And the bodega at the corner of McKibbin Street and Bushwick Avenue has become the place to pick up food, meet friends and practice Spanish with the clerks.
 </textdata>

  Deeper into Bushwick, however, the prospects for peace between the new arrivals and longtime residents may not be so good.

  As Democrats pick apart the voting record of Richard Cheney, many pundits have wondered why George W. Bush picked a real conservative as his running mate. After all, they say, doesn't this selection belie his carefully honed image as the son and heir of the ''kinder, gentler'' president?

  First, let it be said that the senior Bush was not elected president because he offered the nation a ''kinder, gentler'' version of Reagan conservatism. He was elected because voters were, in effect, electing Ronald Reagan to a third term through his surrogate and because Mr. Bush wasn't Michael Dukakis.

  Mr. Bush was defeated in 1992 for several reasons, but one, most assuredly, was that he had spent close to four years proving that he was not Ronald Reagan and didn't want to be Ronald Reagan.

  The second George Bush has a serious opportunity to be elected president only eight years after his father left office. But can he be swept into the White House on the wings of ''compassionate conservatism''? The slogan's meaning seems like a euphemism for moderate Republicanism. Certainly, for the mostly unhyphenated conservatives who make up the large Reagan wing of the party, the slogan has a vaguely negative connotation.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Just as President Bush's ''kinder, gentler'' conservatism was a slap, intended or not, at Mr. Reagan and his policies, so is ''compassionate conservatism'' a slap, intended or not, at those Reagan conservatives who have kept the G.O.P. alive for the last 20 years.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush seemed to think the slogan would resonate among voters in much the same way the ''New Deal'' and ''Great Society'' did. Instead, its appeal appears to be limited to moderate Republicans already firmly in his camp and to a select group of disaffected Democrats fed up with the Clinton-Gore years and not willing to waste a vote on either Pat Buchanan or Ralph Nader.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush may sense this. A man who has twice won the Texas statehouse can be expected to have good political instincts. At any rate, Mr. Bush may have selected Mr. Cheney as his vice presidential running mate precisely because Mr. Cheney is not a compassionate conservative. He is a conservative plain and simple.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  His congressional record wins a 91 percent approval rating from the conservative American Constitutional Union, and the group says the rating  would be higher if Mr. Cheney had not voted for a few Reagan initiatives that it deemed too liberal. His tenure as defense secretary shows no hint of the social liberalism and experimentation that has dominated the Pentagon in the last eight years, nor is there any sign of moderation since he entered the business world. And even though he worked for both President Gerald Ford and President George Bush, he is viewed by Reaganites as one of theirs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Governor Bush and his allies are  playing down Mr. Cheney's conservative credentials and emphasizing his broad experience as an executive in government and in business.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That doesn't quite wash. After all, other equally qualified, if moderate, candidates were available, and they might have brought more to the ticket. (One thinks of the oft-mentioned Tom Ridge, governor of Pennsylvania.) But selecting one of them would have validated the conservatives' fear that Mr. Bush's ''compassionate conservatism'' reveals, in truth, a moderate heart.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So, it is with good reason that Mr. Bush picked a conservative as his running mate. Why in the world won't he admit that?

  ''There's not a sentence in the speech that looks in the camera and says, 'I want you!' '' said Mr. Bush, speaking from Joplin, Mo., before crisscrossing Kentucky as he made his way through states that voted for President Clinton four years ago. [Page 23.] ''But the speech itself should do that. The speech, if it's done right, and I think it will be, will send a broadened message.''

  As Republicans in red, white and blue boaters and embroidered ''Bush for President'' shirts jammed into this city today for the convention's opening on Monday, Mr. Bush said he realized that the usual suspense may be gone because he has already announced his running mate, Dick Cheney.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He also said the American people should not expect political fisticuffs because he has followed an ''iron-fist rule'' to make sure there is a harmonious show. As part of that effort, Mr. Bush defended his decision to keep some hard-edged conservatives off stage, saying there were ''no slights intended.'' He was determined, he explained, to avert a repetition of the scene at the Houston convention in 1992, which is remembered not for his father's re-election drive but for scathing speeches.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''A lot of people said the '92 convention set a negative tone, and that it set a divisive message for the country,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I didn't see it that way at the time. People felt it was part of a dismal political year. This is a different time, a different approach, in the sense that we are trying to limit the amount of time that elected officials are speaking relative to the amount of time that we spell out policy.'' He added: ''This is not a divisive moment. This is a uniting moment.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet Mr. Bush acknowledged that all the happy talk could limit the drama, as well as the public's interest in the convention. Asked whether he was worried about the possible lack of excitement, he laughed and said: ''That's a pretty legitimate question. I hope, I think, if there is any suspense it will be in the roll-out of ideas. Hopefully, people will be interested in what I have to say. I hope we can get enough people to pay attention to it.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Bush made clear that he intended to go further than Republicans have in the past, especially in appealing to Democrats. To drive that message home, Mr. Bush will be introduced at the convention by Mr. Bullock's widow, Jan. And all week long, the stage will showcase women and people from minority groups, faces that are not usually highlighted at Republican conventions.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Mr. Bush's effort is reminiscent of what Bill Clinton did in his acceptance speech in 1992. ''The choice we offer is not conservative or liberal,'' Mr. Clinton said then. ''In many ways it's not even Republican or Democratic. It is different. It is new. And it will work.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the interview today, Mr. Bush said he would emphasize how he had worked with Democrats. ''One of the things that people don't really know about me is that I've been good about bringing people together to get things accomplished in Texas,'' he said.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush would not speak directly about how crucial it was in his address on Thursday night, which he said he was ''still massaging,'' to allay concerns that he might not be ready to be president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush scoffed at criticism from some moderates that his choice of Mr. Cheney underscores that he is more concerned with burnishing his credentials on the right. ''To the extent that there's people out there carping,'' he said, ''that's just normal.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Refusing to say how serious he had been about turning to a running mate who backed abortion rights, like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania or Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, Mr. Bush would only say, ''I considered a lot of people.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush said he was not worried about advisers who have warned that the campaign is squandering a prime opportunity by not sharply repudiating Democrats on stage. ''I will needle my opponent, but we don't have a let's-tear-down night or a slash-and-burn night, or a night that subjects the other side to public ridicule,'' he said. ''And I'm not going to talk about Mrs. Clinton. She is running for the United States Senate and has her hands full in the great state of New York.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, even as he himself intends to stay above the partisan fray, Mr. Bush acknowledged that not every speaker will give the Democrats a pass. ''I'm sure people are going to get up there and say some things about the pitfalls of our opponent's record.'' Aware, no doubt, that President Clinton remains popular among many voters, he said, ''By the way, the opponent is not President Clinton. The opponent is Vice President Gore.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush sounded defiant about the criticisms that he has relied on his father, the former president, for guidance in picking Mr. Cheney and in making other decisions. Governor Bush is clearly taking the offensive on that count, and said that in his acceptance speech he planned ''to say how much I love my family -- how much I respect my father.''

  The Bush campaign and the convention planners took great care to make sure that when viewers tune in they will see only harmony on stage, and a message of moderation and inclusion. People familiar with the discussions said that while there was no choice but to let Senator John McCain speak on Tuesday evening, given that he emerged from his losing primary fight with quite a following, the Bush campaign did not want its message delivered by more conservative, and perhaps, outspoken party members who opposed him, like Alan Keyes and Steve Forbes.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Forbes, in an interview, insisted that he was not offended. ''In terms of speaking, realistically, how many people are going to listen unless you're William Jennings Bryan?'' He said Mr. Bush's acceptance speech ''towers over everything else'' and any other speech delivered this week. Moreover, Mr. Forbes said he was reassured by Mr. Bush's decision to pick a conservative as his running mate. ''His choosing Cheney speaks volumes,'' he said.

  Michael K. Deaver, who was President Reagan's image consultant, said Mr. Bush has much the same challenge that his boss had in 1980 at the convention in Detroit, when he used his speech to reassure the public that he had the breadth and command to be president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Reagan was a likable guy, people genuinely had a positive impression of him through Hollywood and through his governor's days,'' Mr. Deaver said. ''But they really weren't sure this guy had any depth or any original thoughts. That impression began to change with the speech he gave. Bush is in a similar position.''

  Mr. Bush and his advisers have sought to play down how much of a political lift they will draw from the convention. They note that polls show that Republican voters are already much more enthusiastic about their candidate than Democrats are about Al Gore -- so they have less room to gain.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In an interview, Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said of Mr. Gore: ''I think he'll get a bigger bounce out of the convention than we will. There's very little more we can gain by consolidating our base. Our view is that he's going to essentially get twice the bounce out of the convention than we're going to. We're going to find ourselves in a very tight race after Labor Day.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000

  Asked how much Mr. Bush might gain in the opinion polls after the convention, he said, ''You can pick up four or five points.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He said he was not worried about Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative who is expected to run as the Reform Party nominee, siphoning votes from Mr. Bush. ''He's something always to watch but he is diminished,'' Mr. Rove said. ''He's not grown in stature or grown in impact as the years have gone on. Why? Because he's Pat Buchanan.''
 </textdata>

  ''If he looks like he's a spoiler in some fashion against George Bush,'' said Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition and a foe of Mr. McCain, ''it will destroy him.''

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush is clearly delighting in this opportunity for him to be glorified all week. Asked what will be the convention's best moment, he referred to his speech, saying, ''It's when, from my selfish perspective, it's walking out on that stage.''

  The accepted wisdom nowadays is that the national political conventions are little more than expensive relics, and it is true that the major events of the Republican jamboree that begins tomorrow in Philadelphia are largely foreordained. Gov. George W. Bush's nomination is secure, his vice president chosen. Yet this is a supremely important and surprisingly suspenseful time for Mr. Bush. The image of the man who promised a future based on ''compassionate conservatism'' is murkier than it was a few weeks ago, as is the very meaning of his trademark term. The Philadelphia convention will be an exercise in political packaging whose decisive moments will be Mr. Bush's acceptance speech, the final drafting of the G.O.P. platform, and Richard  Cheney's reintroduction to the national audience. All these, in turn, will determine whether Mr. Bush puts his stamp on the Republican Party or the party's right wing draws a hard-edged, highly ideological template for his candidacy.

  In short, the political world will be watching to see if Mr. Bush can pull his campaign back to the moderate middle from which he governed in Texas. Clearly, Mr. Cheney's selection did more to muddle Mr. Bush's message than he ever expected, even though he insists he was not ''blindsided'' by the auto-pilot conservatism of Mr. Cheney's voting record in Congress. ''I'm a conservative, too,'' Mr. Bush said, but it is hard to believe that the governor's conservatism would have encompassed Mr. Cheney's votes against Head Start and the equal rights amendment, his hard-line stance on every gun control measure that came his way, or his opposition to a resolution in 1986 that called on South Africa to release Nelson Mandela from prison.

''I'm a conservative, too,'' Mr. Bush said, but it is hard to believe that the governor's conservatism would have encompassed Mr. Cheney's votes against Head Start and the equal rights amendment, his hard-line stance on every gun control measure that came his way, or his opposition to a resolution in 1986 that called on South Africa to release Nelson Mandela from prison.

  If Mr. Bush wishes to persuade voters that his G.O.P. will not resurrect the inflexible attitudes and stark policies of the Gingrich era, he must dominate the convention stage. That is still a big stage, despite the decision by the main broadcast networks to limit their coverage to one hour in prime time. There will be a huge audience in those peak periods and a continuing audience of great sophistication for the other media to which the networks are passing the torch of political communications -- cable, C-Span, the 24-hour news shows and the Internet.

  Mr. Bush must use his acceptance speech to reassert his control of his candidacy and establish his primacy within the party. Nobody knows this better than he does. His father used his brilliantly conceived ''kinder, gentler nation'' speech in New Orleans in 1988 to establish his independence and to distance himself from the social callousness of Reaganism. Not coincidentally, the speech helped give him a lead over Michael Dukakis that he never relinquished. Four years later, the same George Bush damaged himself badly with a pallid speech that left him looking like a helpless bystander as Pat Buchanan hijacked the party's philosophical bank account with his scary rant about cultural warfare.

  Governor Bush cannot afford to look like a bystander at his convention. He needs a speech proving that his vision rather than Mr. Cheney's crabbed ideology will define Republican ideals. Another place where Mr. Bush can put his brand on the party is the platform. A draft released last week showed some movement away from the sheer venom of the 1996 platform. But the new document offered no evidence of any sustained effort or desire by Mr. Bush to move his party to more sensible ground on two key issues. He left in place a harsh abortion plank, even though he uses a more conciliatory tone in speeches. On gun control, the platform repeats the proven formula for failure through stronger enforcement of existing laws.

  At a time when conventions no longer decide nominations, they still provide a testing place where candidacies can either soar or flop. In the primaries, Mr. Bush showed that he could take a punch from a strong opponent. In Philadelphia, he will have his chance to show that he can stand up to his party's fiercest factions and sketch a picture of America that will attract, rather than frighten, middle-of-the-road voters.

  THERE are three things you will have to look hard for as you tune in to the Republican National Convention here this week: A true-blue conservative icon on center stage. (There may be a few, but they will be sprinkled in a line-up that resembles a Benetton commercial.) Any utterance of the word ''abortion.'' (You're more likely to hear the words, ''poor'' or ''underclass.'') The traditional savaging of the opposition. (Instead, look for subtle denigrations of the Clinton-Gore years and bipartisan overtures.)

  Eight years after Mr. Clinton captured the White House by venturing toward the middle and running against some of the orthodoxies of his party -- including those on welfare, teacher unions and racial quotas -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is trying a similar approach. While Mr. Bush is not moving as far as Mr. Clinton in forsaking the principles of his party, he sounds a lot like a Democrat when he holds forth about protecting Social Security, reaching out to the dispossessed and lavishing more money on public education.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush last week startled Democrats and Republicans alike when he spoke out about prescription drug benefits for the elderly. Mr. Bush has even appropriated Mr. Clinton's mantra from 1992, ''a different kind of Democrat.'' He would be ''a different kind of Republican,'' he reassures audiences.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But to win the White House, Mr. Bush must prove that he is doing more than muffling the vitriol by yanking the Patrick Buchanans and Marilyn Quayles and Phil Gramms offstage. His challenge is to assemble a new Republican majority with the help of constituencies that voted Democratic four years ago.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  To do that, he has to convince voters that he is not beholden to the right wing. With some success, polls show, Mr. Bush is making a play for the blue-collar Democrats and suburban women who backed Mr. Clinton overwhelmingly four years ago. He is reaching out aggressively to Latino voters. He even dared to speak before the N.A.A.C.P., not because he thought he could convert African American voters -- among the Democratic Party's most loyal backers --- but because of the signal it would send to moderates that he is inclusive.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush can afford to reach out to moderates this year because the base of his own party, ravenous to reclaim the White House, is willing to make compromises. Not since the love fest for Ronald Reagan in 1984 have Republicans appeared so harmonious on the eve of their convention.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  As the campaign intensifies, though, Mr. Gore and the Democrats will increasingly portray Mr. Bush as Newt Gingrich without the scowl. To this end, they were handed some potent ammunition last week, when Mr. Bush picked Dick Cheney as his running mate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Cheney pairing suggested that Mr. Bush was harkening to his party's conservative past rather than seeking a partner who could broaden the ticket's ideological appeal. Mr. Clinton, in contrast, won credibility as a reconfigured Democrat by picking Al Gore -- assembling a southern moderate ticket.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush did not have to settle on a conservative. He has the latitude denied Bob Dole when, four years ago, he picked Jack Kemp as his running mate. Mr. Dole, however, needed someone to rouse the party's conservative faithful, who had not rallied around him, as they have around Mr. Bush.
 </textdata>

  Will he be as successful at co-opting -- or at least taming -- the opposition as Mr. Clinton? Or will he fail, as did Michael Dukakis in 1988? In that year's campaign, Vice President George Bush effectively branded him a Massachusetts liberal and card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union.

  Thus far, Mr. Bush and the Republicans have had it both ways. It happened this weekend in Philadelphia. The Bush-controlled Republican Party drafted a platform that cast off several hard-edged party positions of the past, like abolishing the Education Department and the National Endowment for the Arts. The hostile language toward immigration four years ago was substituted with a tribute to the role of new Americans. But conservatives were not neglected. The platform contained a reaffirmation of its ban on abortion -- with no exceptions -- despite a drive on Friday by some party members to soften the langauge.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It happened in Austin last week. There Mr. Bush was, introducing to the world a running mate who had one of the most conservative voting records in Congress. But in their oratory, they sounded as Democratic as Al Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush declared that he called upon Mr. Cheney to help him ''accomplish some great goals'' for the nation: ''To save and strengthen Social Security. To improve Medicare and provide prescription drugs for the elderly. To reform our public schools.'' All but the last point -- ''To rebuild our military to keep the peace'' -- sounded like they would be more likely to issue from Al Gore's mouth.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Democrats, of course, are already  working hard not to let Mr. Bush get away with this balancing act. They argue that many of his proposals for new spending on social projects are modest and symbolic. And most of these proposals, they note, offer traditionally Republican solutions that rely heavily on the power of the private sector, as in his plan to privatize Social Security or his endorsement of vouchers to allow public money to go to private schools.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Voters may recognize that there are some real ideological divides between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. A New York Times/CBS News Poll last week showed that the public sees stark differences in how they would handle taxes, health care, abortion and the environment.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, Mr. Bush's right-down-the-middle tactics may succeed. Both parties have a history of remaking themselves. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower refused to tear down elements of the New Deal and spoke loftily about retooling the Republican Party. While Mr. Bush calls himself a ''compassionate conservative,'' Mr. Eisenhower favored the term ''dynamic conservatism.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet while prominent conservatives are staying silent as their bread-and-butter issues -- prayer in school, and opposing abortion and homosexual rights -- get short shrift (or no shrift at all), Mr. Bush could be risking his relations with others on the right, who worry that the party is losing its soul.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, warned that Mr. Bush had better be careful that his overtures to moderates do not become more substantive. ''The feel-good stuff and atmospherics is all fine,'' he said. ''But when push comes to shove, Republicans win elections in which there is a clear distinction between their position and the Democratic position on the issues. If you spend all your time reaching out, you're putting your base in danger.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000

  For now, Mr. Bush seems to be having more luck reassuring conservatives than his father, former President George Bush, whose was never fully trusted on the right.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Robertson, for one, is haunted by the elder Bush's speech, written by Peggy Noonan, at the 1988 Republican convention at which the nominee uttered his famous anti-tax pledge. ''I just hope and pray he doesn't have Peggy Noonan write, 'Read My Lips,' '' Mr. Robertson said. ''We don't need any tax pledge redux!''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000

  So the right is watching. But if the younger Bush has learned anything from his father, it is that if you try to tack right and then dance to the center, you can end up falling off the political stage.

  Mr. O'Hara, who savored the self-destructive streak among the pampered, would have enjoyed Bushville as much as Gibbsville: a millennial convention rooting for the goof-off son of the fired boss to get the big job. It is the old-boy network writ large, a bunch of mostly rich, white, male, older delegates pouring into the city of underdog ''Rocky'' to see two overdog oilmen who got to go to Yale preach about a more democratic Republican Party.

  The writer who always had his nose pressed up against the glass would have understood perfectly why George Walker Bush did not scrutinize Dick Cheney's voting record before anointing him -- just as George Herbert Walker Bush never sat down with J.

  The two George Bushes are engaging and unpretentious. But deep down in their genes is that elitist sense that the important decisions should be made by those who are bred to make them. Their ideology is friendship. They equate integrity with loyalty to them. They are genuinely surprised when someone accuses them of callousness -- whether it is the Willie Horton issue with the father or the relentless Texas death-row executions with the son -- because their perspective is, ''I know I'm honorable, therefore I'm best accountable to myself.''

  The family code is rooted in the noblesse oblige air of Prescott Bush, a craggy senator and a Wall Street executive who inhabited the partners' room at Brown Brothers Harriman, a rarefied wood-paneled universe filled with Skull and Bones men and roll-top desks and a sense that the fate of the nation was best left in their hands over cigars and brandy.

  Newsweek reports today that W. was always ''somewhat oblivious to the political power of his family ties.'' Running for Congress in 1978, he went to a Republican candidates' school. ''David Dreier, now a Republican congressman from California,'' Newsweek says, ''recalls young Bush excitedly telling him, 'I've got the greatest idea of how to raise money for the campaign. Have your mother send a letter to your family's Christmas card list. I just did and I got $350,000!' It doesn't seem to have occurred to Bush that not everyone has Barbara Bush's Rolodex full of senators and statesmen and G.O.P. fat cats.''

  The 48-page document approved today was a fitting successor to the platform created for Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992, which broke sharply from the party's liberal roots.

  The liberals did not go down quietly. Talking to reporters outside the committee room, members of a group calling itself the Progressive Caucus to the Democratic National Convention complained that their views had been ignored and that the Gore campaign had pressured committee members to vote against their planks.

  Tom Hayden, a state senator from Los Angeles who is also a Gore delegate, said the platform had failed to address the challenge of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate who strongly opposes the World Trade Organization and who, polls show, has been drawing voters away from Mr. Gore in California.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-30-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Hayden said the center-straddling platform would turn off the party's liberal base, making it more difficult to find committed campaign foot-soldiers. As a result, he warned, Mr. Gore would have to rely on negative attacks against the Republican ticket of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Dick Cheney.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Liberals contended that the idea was unproven, costly and likely to ignite a new arms race. But Mr. Gore's supporters argued that remaining silent on missile defense would give the Republicans ammunition to attack Democrats as soft on defense. Mr. Bush supports a global missile defense system. The progressives' amendment was tabled.

  ''I think I was the victim of people wanting change,'' said Mr. Bush, who served as vice president under President Ronald Reagan for two terms before moving into the White House. He described voters' sentiments in 1992 as ''eight years of Reagan, four years of Bush, we want a change.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  He and Mrs. Bush also said that they thought the notion of ''Clinton fatigue'' was real, and that their son's frequent pledge to ''restore honor and integrity'' to the Oval Office was one that would resonate with voters who felt that those virtues had been compromised by Mr. Clinton.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''It isn't even debatable, in my view,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Aides said that today's joint interview was one of only three or four that the Bushes had done in the last year, and their comments were striking for several reasons, chief among them the way in which Mr. Bush interpreted both his and his son's presidential fortunes in terms of historic forces outside their control.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In assessing his son's prospects, Mr. Bush dwelled longer on the country's itch for something different than on the Texas governor's record and positions on issues, though he did offer hearty praise for both.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At the very least, the Bushes exhibited a sensitivity to President Bush's legacy. Mrs. Bush, almost as an aside, murmured that the strong economy the country was enjoying  was really her husband's doing, and Mr. Bush mentioned that he was bothered by President Clinton's assertions that Mr. Gore was perhaps the best vice president ever.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I'd like to argue that on my own behalf,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to his own years as vice president. ''We had the, you know, drug interdiction program. We had the deregulation task force. I headed up the antiterrorist task force. I took the case for American missiles to Germany, the Pershings. I mean, there was a lot of substance there.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Mr. Clinton's name had initially come up, Mrs. Bush signaled that she and her husband would take a pass on the topic, in accordance with a long-held vow not to speak ill of Mr. Bush's successor.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But minutes later, Mrs. Bush was discussing Americans' lowered expectations for public officials, and when her husband said she could not blame that entirely on Mr. Clinton, she responded, ''Oh, I can.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bushes also addressed the persistent questions about whether their son had enough knowledge of foreign affairs to lead the nation. Mr. Bush, a former U.N. ambassador and an envoy to China who campaigned for the White House on his foreign policy expertise, acknowledged that his son did not know as much as he did when he became president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''You get good people,'' he added, echoing his son's frequent refrain that a president principally assembles a team, delegates responsibilities and makes final decisions based upon good advice. ''George knows enough to do that and enough about the world to have good judgment on his own at this point,'' Mr. Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mrs. Bush then chimed in with a reference to Mr. Gore's awkward toast, during a visit to China in 1997, with Prime Minister Li Peng, who had ordered the violent crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I don't think we ought to think of Al Gore in China at the time that he was caught with the Champagne glasses,'' she said. ''I'm not going to think about that.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''What are you doing?'' Mr. Bush said, acting displeased with her acidic interruptions but never really seeming so. ''You're not going to be in this interview if you're going to start talking like that. George will call and he'll be furious.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bushes have kept a fairly low public profile throughout their son's presidential campaign, taking care not to overshadow him, not to invite criticism that he was simply riding on his family's name, or to make accidental statements that could become controversial.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000

  ''It's mind-boggling for me,'' Mr. Bush said during the interview, which began in the living room of the main house, continued over a lunch of lobster salad on a rear terrace overlooking the Atlantic, and ended when he had to rush off with his son Jeb, the Florida governor, for a 12:30 p.m. tee time at a nearby golf course.
 </textdata>

  Jeb Bush, who joined his parents for lunch, said that his brother, George, was benefiting from a Republican yearning to take back the White House -- a desire so strong that the party was managing to paper over internal divisions that had fractured it in the past.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Eight years in the wilderness brings a higher tolerance for diversity,'' Jeb Bush said, adding that 12 years in the wilderness had made the Democratic Party rally in a similar way around Mr. Clinton in 1992.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''If you looked at Bill Clinton's record as governor of Arkansas, he was given a huge break by groups that were anxious to have a Democrat in the White House,'' Jeb Bush said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  President and Mrs. Bush acknowledged that in 1992 or 1993 or even the beginning of 1994, they never expected a day like this to come. Mr. Bush left Washington as something of a pariah in the Republican Party, a man who had acquiesced to a tax increase and lost the White House.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-8-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And George W. Bush had never really demonstrated the sort of political ambition that his brother Jeb had. When he told his mother that he planned to run against the incumbent Texas governor, Ann Richards, in 1994, she told him he would lose. His mother was wrong.
 </textdata>

  Both Mr. and Mrs. Bush had generally kind words for Mr. Gore, saying that when they were in the White House and he was a senator, they had met and liked him. When asked if Mr. Gore had gone overboard, during the impeachment proceedings, by calling Mr. Clinton one of the greatest American presidents, Mr. Bush expressed sympathy for the political bind in which Mr. Gore found himself.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  ''Greatest president, though?'' Mrs. Bush asked, referring to Mr. Gore's remark. ''In history?''

  In many ways, the 41-page document tries to straddle the same ideological divide that faces Mr. Gore in his quest for the presidency. Even as he tries to reach out to moderate and independent voters this fall, Mr. Gore will need to energize core Democratic voters, who tend to be more liberal.

  Where the platform adopts Republican-sounding ideas, it usually criticizes the Republican version of those ideas. On tax cuts, for instance, the platform advocates reductions for ''working parents.'' But it harshly attacks Gov. George W. Bush's proposed across-the-board tax cut with populist language.

  ''Taken together, George W.

  NEW EVIDENCE OF NADER'S IMPACT  When Michigan voters consider a three-way presidential race among George W. Bush, Al Gore and Patrick J. Buchanan, the expected Reform Party nominee, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are statistically tied, with Mr. Buchanan coming in a very distant third, a new poll indicates. But when the name of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, is added, Mr. Gore slips well behind Mr. Bush, trailed by Mr. Nader and then Mr. Buchanan. Mr. Nader appears to draw some labor support at Mr. Gore's expense because of differences over trade issues. In a statewide telephone poll conducted for The Detroit Free Press by the research group EPIC/MRA, a research group in Lansing, Mr. Bush drew the support of 45 percent of likely voters, Mr. Gore 40 percent and Mr. Buchanan 4 percent. When Mr. Nader was added, Mr. Bush was the choice of 46 percent of the voters, Mr. Gore 34 percent, Mr. Nader 8 percent and Mr. Buchanan 3 percent. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

  GORE'S TENANTS MOVING ON  The family renting a Tennessee home from Vice President Al Gore is moving to Ohio -- with the help of seven volunteer movers and officials from the Tennessee Republican Party. The moving team arrived yesterday at the home in Carthage to load two trucks with the household goods of Charles and Tracy Mayberry and their four children. Mrs. Mayberry called Mr. Gore a ''slumlord'' last month, saying she wanted to get his attention so much-needed repairs would be made. Mr. Gore promised to get the repairs done, but Mrs. Mayberry contends that nothing has happened. A Gore spokesman, Douglas Hattaway, said that all the repairs requested had in fact been made.

  Asked how he countenanced such a proposal by Mr. Eskew, Mr. Gore said: ''You'll have to ask him that. What he did before he worked for me is something you'll have to ask him.''

  Earlier this week, Mr. Gore accused Citizens for Better Medicare, a group created by the drug industry, of running a media campaign that was ''polluting the airwaves.''

  Ms. Bennett, a political independent from Lincoln, Neb., is running for president this year in a field that is far more crowded than one might think. As of last month, 226 people had filed papers with the Federal Election Commission indicating their intention of seeking the White House. The list includes major party candidates like Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas but also candidates so far on the political fringe -- in some cases, even beyond -- that they make people like Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party, John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party seem like mainstream contenders.

  In that regard, Ms. Harder is typical of the outsiders who filed papers. At best, many say, they hope to influence Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush on an issue or two. But even better-known alternative candidates, like Ralph Nader of the Greens, Harry Browne of the Libertarians or Ross Perot, who represented the Reform Party in 1992 and 1996, do little more than draw new focus to old issues.

  GEORGE BUSH. I think he'll win. Again, it's mind-boggling for me, a former president, to think our son will be president. I think a lot of it is that after this primary, where he took such a huge pounding, the press had a massive love affair with John McCain -- nobody can question that, that's just objective, even from a nonobjective guy -- but after that, there was a distorted view of George, I think, and now . . . people are beginning to see what his heartbeat is, what he's really like, that he's a decent person, that he likes people, has done a good job in his state. I don't think in the fall that the press is going to have the same love affair with Gore that they had with John McCain.

  MR. BUSH. Oh, I don't know about that. I'm going to leave it to George's campaign to define Al Gore. He can identify with people, and I think that's coming through. And also, they're going to want change. And I believe there is a Clinton fatigue. And all of these things will inure to George's benefit just as Gore will be trying to have this good economy inure to his . . .

  MR. BUSH. We don't get into that because he beat me and then it looks like a poor sport, but I did speak out once in the depths of the Monica Lewinsky thing and said this is disgraceful. But I think it's more than that very unhappy time period of impeachment. I think it's change. I think I was the victim of people wanting change: ''Eight years of Reagan, four years of Bush, we want a change.'' And all the things that I felt strongly about never materialized as issues. And I think the same thing is true now. I think people kind of like change, like the idea of change from time to time. I think that works for George's benefit. I don't think Gore can present himself as a candidate of change. . . .

  But at the presidential level, Mr. Nader has nothing but venom for Mr. Gore and President Clinton, whom he accuses of offering ''some of the most intensive demonstrations of political cowardliness in American history.''

  If there was any good news for Mr. Gore out of the rally here, it would seem to be that Mr. Nader's crowd was, by and large, so left-leaning that many voters there were not even the vice president's to lose. Several people in the audience said they had voted for Green or Libertarian Party candidates in the past.

  Mr. Gore's speech came at the end of the organization's weeklong convention, which opened on Monday with a speech by the vice president's likely Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush.

  The competition between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush for Hispanic voters has stepped up in recent days, when some recent polls have shown Mr. Bush cutting into the Democrats' historical domination among Hispanic voters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a poll from interviews with 2,721 likely Hispanic voters released today by The San Jose Mercury News, Mr. Gore was shown winning 50 percent of the Hispanic vote, compared with 34 percent for Mr. Bush. In 1996, President Clinton won more than 70 percent of the Hispanic vote.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said polls showing Mr. Bush making inroads among Hispanic voters are meaningless so early in the campaign. ''You can't compare poll numbers this far out from an election with results of previous elections,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Hispanic voters see that Al Gore is focused on issues they care deeply about, like education and health care,'' he continued. ''And the more they learn about both candidates the wider this margin will grow.''
 </textdata>

  Mr. Gore did not mention Mr. Bush in his remarks. But he criticized Senate Republicans for holding up the nomination of Enrique Moreno to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

  The so-called missile shield is an example in another sense, even more profound. President Clinton is considering a ''thin'' system, designed to deal with the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles coming from such countries as North Korea. Republicans in general, and Gov. George W. Bush in particular, are arguing for a much bigger and more expensive system that would also cover American troops abroad and our allies.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The purpose of the thin idea is plainly political. President Clinton wants to protect himself -- and Vice President Gore -- from Republican charges that they are weak on defense.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ironically, it seems doubtful that the tactic will succeed. Despite enormous scientific doubts about the workability of antimissile devices, and extravagant cost, Americans have liked the dream of an invulnerable shield since President Reagan floated it. Governor Bush is likely to score with his call for an all-out system.

  This week, when Al Gore proposed an energy plan with a light-green tint, he no doubt pulled a few votes from the Nader camp. If Mr. Gore can keep going and co-opt the Green Party positions on campaign reform, labor issues and world trade, he just might take enough votes from Mr. Nader to win the election. And I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Nader declared such an outcome a victory, exonerating himself of charges of egotism.  GLENN CHENEY  Hanover, Conn., June 30, 2000

  Attacking the pharmaceutical industry for engaging in ''corporate chutzpah'' and for ''gouging the consumer unfairly,'' Vice President Al Gore said today that he would take on the drug manufacturers next week at campaign stops in battleground states from California to Pennsylvania.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So Mr. Gore is dusting off his Congressional record and past speeches to stake out policies at odds with the manufacturers. A review of his record, though, and a detailed talk with the vice president make clear that his views are more nuanced than his language suggests. And some of the same drug makers that Mr. Gore now criticizes have hired his friends and advisers to represent them as lobbyists.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The pharmaceutical industry, which responded icily to Mr.Gore's statements today, has in some cases embraced his positions. For instance, drug manufacturers are among the biggest beneficiaries of the government's tax credit for research and development, and Mr. Gore favors legislation that would make that credit permanent.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And while he argued for greater disclosure of the industry's pricing practices, the vice president allowed that some information probably should remain proprietary. Mr. Gore has also been a strong supporter of the biotechnology industry, which through collaborations and mergers is becoming part of the prescription-drug business.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''I don't see myself as a basher of the pharmaceutical companies,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I see myself as opposing the excesses that have accompanied their enormous market power, excesses that have come at the expense of consumers.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000

 <textdata>
  Drug executives, who have contributed far more to the campaign of Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, have mixed feelings about Mr. Gore.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His support for innovation and new technology endears him to them, and he is not nearly as vociferous a critic as the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader. But industry executives are becoming more nervous about Mr. Gore as the presidential campaign progresses. And when asked about today's escalating attack, their trade association responded in kind.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  With his heightened, anti-industry stand that consumers are ''being ripped off'' by drug makers, Mr. Gore is positioning himself as a champion of a far-reaching Medicare prescription drug benefit for senior citizens.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At the same time, his campaign's polls show that the issue resonates strongly with voters. So Mr. Gore is also trying to sharpen the distinctions between himself and Mr. Bush, who supports a benefit that would rely more heavily on private insurers, an approach the industry favors.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That concern is reflected in the contributions the two major presidential contenders have received. To date, Mr. Bush's campaign has received $221,715 from drug company executives, while Mr. Gore has received $50,700, election records show.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has not made the prescription-drug issue a cornerstone of his campaign, but one of his top health advisers said that the Texas governor is opposed to tampering with the industry's ability to develop life-saving medications.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Anything that would dampen innovation, particularly price controls, ought to be avoided,'' said Bill Roper, who was a top health official in the administration of Mr. Bush's father, and is now dean of the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The Bush campaign did not make the Texas governor available for an interview.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore said today that he, too, opposed regulating drug prices or profits. ''I don't see it as the government's role,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  For example, Mr. Gore said he supported a legislative amendment, recently passed by the House of Representatives, requiring drug makers to agree to reasonable prices for treatments invented in collaboration with government scientists.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There are more than 90 such collaborations under way with the National Cancer Institute alone. But the industry has consistently opposed a pricing clause, and its protests were a main reason why the National Institutes of Health abandoned such a provision in 1995. ''If I had been in the Congress, I certainly would have voted for it,'' Mr. Gore said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a similar vein, Mr. Gore supports requiring drug companies to pay a fee to the government for medicines developed with the help of government grants. Some of today's top-selling drugs got their start in the federally financed laboratories of university scientists, and Mr. Gore said that the public ''ought to have some right not to be gouged on the purchase of products that they themselves helped to develop.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Knight has since left the lobbying business, and Mr. Gore insisted today that he has never talked with him, or other friends who have represented drug makers, about industry issues. ''All the positions I've taken,'' he said, ''are against their clients.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was clearly well-briefed for the hourlong interview, and seemed to relish the opportunity to go on the offensive against an industry he has long taken an interest in. At one point, he recalled a meeting he had 18 years ago with Representative Richard Bolling, then the chairman of the House Rules Committee -- a meeting that led to the defeat of the patent-extension legislation the industry coveted.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-1-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  At the time, Mr. Gore said, he was particularly irked that the industry refused to make public data that would have supported its position. ''It was the most astounding example of corporate chutzpah I had ever run across,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  PEROT WILL NOT RUN -- Ross Perot, a two-time presidential candidate, decided yesterday against putting his name on the Reform Party's primary ballot, removing a big potential roadblock for Patrick J. Buchanan's candidacy. A Perot spokesman, Russell Verney, said Mr. Perot decided against running because he had no intention of actually competing for the White House against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican contender, and Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic rival. A daylong series of meetings at Mr. Perot's office in Dallas included ''intense pressure'' to put his name on the ballot in an effort to stop Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Verney said. But Mr. Perot felt it would be unethical to seek the nomination but not really run, he said. Another difficulty was that Mr. Perot would have appeared on only about half the states' ballots in November. His decision to forgo a place on the primary ballot leaves two candidates who say they have enough support to win spots there: Mr. Buchanan, a former Republican, and the Natural Law Party candidate, John Hagelin.

Bush of Texas, the Republican contender, and Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic rival. A daylong series of meetings at Mr. Perot's office in Dallas included ''intense pressure'' to put his name on the ballot in an effort to stop Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Verney said. But Mr. Perot felt it would be unethical to seek the nomination but not really run, he said. Another difficulty was that Mr. Perot would have appeared on only about half the states' ballots in November. His decision to forgo a place on the primary ballot leaves two candidates who say they have enough support to win spots there: Mr. Buchanan, a former Republican, and the Natural Law Party candidate, John Hagelin.

  PROMOTING A NEW NO. 2 -- With former Senator John Danforth of Missouri having taken himself out of the running, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma has become the speculative name-of-the-moment as a potential running mate for George W. Bush. Mr. Keating's name surfaced at midweek on the Internet as the latest favorite of the Republican presidential contender, though with caveats that everything could change. The Bush campaign took the rumor in stride. ''It's not true,'' the campaign spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said. ''The governor has made no decision.'' Mr. Bush is to meet at his Texas ranch on Monday with Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary who is heading the vice-presidential search, but only for an update, Mr. Fleischer said.

  CLINTON TWEAKS G.O.P. -- President Clinton said in Philadelphia yesterday that Republicans would talk a good game when they arrived for their convention in late July but were not eager to point out the serious differences that divide the two parties. ''You'll have the awfulest time trying to figure out what the differences are,'' Mr. Clinton told a group of union members. ''They're going to love everybody and help everybody.'' Speaking at a gathering of the American Federation of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees, Mr. Clinton recited a litany of issues on which Democrats and Republicans diverge, from the patients' bill of rights to the minimum wage to gun control. Mr. Clinton also questioned Gov. George W. Bush's commitment to Hispanics, saying he had not urged Republican senators to confirm Enrique Moreno, a Texan whom Mr. Clinton nominated to be a federal judge. ''If he had asked them to give him a hearing, they would have done it,'' Mr. Clinton said of Mr. Bush. ''He didn't say a word.''

  CONTRADICTING BUSH -- A ''Texas Truth Squad'' made up of union members from George W. Bush's home state chose the city where he will be nominated for president to begin a national speaking tour intended to besmirch the governor's record. The squad, consisting of a teacher, a prison guard, a food worker and a social worker, made its debut on Thursday at a union luncheon in Philadelphia presided over by John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has endorsed Vice President Al Gore. Squad members asserted in a series of short speeches that during Mr. Bush's two terms as governor,  Texas has consistently ranked near the bottom in providing health insurance for children, retirement pensions, environmental protection and pay for state workers. Taking special aim at Mr. Bush's claim to be an education reformer, the group said he had diverted money from public schools and tried to raid teacher retirement funds at a time when the state ranked 45th in the College Board test scores. The squad is scheduled to make at least a dozen appearances around the country before Election Day.

  Although Mr. Bush repeatedly announced his appreciation of diversity and his concern for minorities, he did not offer much detail about the specific policies he wanted to implement, or how they would help Hispanics or other minorities. He offered an only slightly altered version of his usual stump speech, framing some of his positions in terms of how they would benefit foreigners and recent immigrants.

 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush did not open the door to a similar exchange with the audience, although he did hold a brief news conference with reporters after he spoke. His speech was his only public event of the day, and it came on a week when he planned to spend every other day at home in Texas.
 </textdata>

  Mr. Bush's appearance today reflected not only his effort to demonstrate concern for members of minorities and to project a sensitive, moderate image, but also his desire to compete seriously for California's 54 electoral votes -- 21 more than any other state -- or at least make the appearance of doing so.
 </textdata>

  Even if Mr. Bush does not carry the state, his campaign would like to give Mr. Gore a scare and a good reason to spend campaign cash on advertising in California's expensive media markets.

 <textdata>
  Making inroads with Hispanic voters, who represented about 13 percent of the Californians who voted in the 1998 elections, is a key part of Mr. Bush's strategy in the state, which he has visited six times, including today, since the Republican primaries essentially ended in the spring.

  As he has done in previous appearances, Mr. Bush introduced his nephew George P.

  In calling for improvements at the immigration service, Mr. Bush was joining voices in both major political parties and staking ground that was anything but controversial.

 </textdata>
 <date>

  ''Once again, Bush is playing follow the leader,'' Mr. Hattaway said. ''Al Gore has long believed that we should streamline the I.N.S., and under the leadership of this administration, the I.N.S. has already cut the application time significantly.''

  The Camp David meetings begin next Tuesday and could run anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, with President Clinton participating on a regular basis. Any peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians produced under his auspices would enhance Mr. Clinton's place in history.

 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in 1987, when Mr. Gore was running his first campaign for president, he gave a very different answer to gun control advocates seeking his support on Senate legislation to ban plastic guns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''He wanted to do whatever it took to reduce gun violence,'' said Sarah Brady, the president of Handgun Control Inc. Ever since, Mrs. Brady has regarded Mr. Gore as one of her movement's staunchest supporters.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This year, Mr. Gore has placed gun control at the center of his campaign for president. He has attacked his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, as a pawn of the N.R.A. and proposed an array of tough laws, including licensing new handgun buyers, limiting gun purchases to one a month and banning inexpensive and easily concealed handguns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But in promoting his gun agenda, Mr. Gore's campaign has largely airbrushed away his early record in Congress of fighting gun control legislation. To his critics, his stark evolution from N.R.A. ally to enemy provides clear evidence that on contentious issues like gun control, abortion and smoking, Mr. Gore has molded his views to fit political needs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore and his supporters argue that his embrace of gun control was a heartfelt response to a rising tide of gun violence in the late 1980's. Mr. Gore himself credits Mrs. Brady -- whose husband, James, was partly paralyzed in 1981 by a bullet meant for President Ronald Reagan -- with helping to change his views.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush has been more consistent on the issue than Mr. Gore, and for years has been seen as a reliable N.R.A. ally. As Texas governor, he has signed into law several bills the rifle association supported, including one letting people with handgun licenses carry concealed weapons and another prohibiting municipalities from suing gun makers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  N.R.A. officials said it was virtually certain the group would endorse Mr. Bush this fall and throw millions of dollars behind his campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In explaining his opposition to stringent gun control, Mr. Bush often asserts that a well-armed populace is an effective deterrent to crime.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In Mr. Gore's first campaign for Congress in 1976, for instance, he indicated to The Nashville Banner, the more conservative of the city's two daily newspapers, that he would not support new gun control laws. When the paper endorsed him, Mr. Gore reprinted and distributed the editorial, which included a glowing reference to his opposition to gun restrictions.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Yet Mr. Gore also muddied his position with mixed messages. In an interview that same year with the city's more liberal newspaper, The Tennessean, where Mr. Gore had earlier worked as a reporter and editorial writer, he contended that The Banner had oversimplified his positions. Instead of opposing gun control wholesale, he told the paper, he was open to certain restrictions, including one he advocates today, a ban on the cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Friends and colleagues say they think Mr. Gore stifled or concealed those pro-gun-control sentiments during the 1976 campaign, fearing that he would anger voters in the Fourth Congressional District, a staunchly Democratic but socially conservative swathe of hamlets, rolling forests and tobacco farms in middle Tennessee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If Mr. Gore was conflicted on the issue during the 1976 campaign, his early voting record in Washington was not. During his first decade in Congress, Mr. Gore steadfastly opposed gun restrictions, winning ''A'' or ''A-'' ratings from the N.R.A. in three of his first five campaigns. And though it appears that he did not receive campaign contributions from the rifle association, the group says it mailed literature praising his record to its members in his district.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore supported efforts in the late 1970's to stop the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from creating a system of serial numbers to be used to trace weapons. The N.R.A. argued that the system was a first step toward national gun registration. Mr. Gore agreed, and voted to cut the bureau's budget by $4.2 million, killing the plan.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After winning election to the Senate in 1984, Mr. Gore continued to be a reliable vote for the rifle association. In his first year, he supported the gun lobby's most prized goal of the decade: a sweeping repeal of federal gun laws that had been enacted after the murders of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King in 1968. Mr. Gore's father, Albert, had voted for those restrictions in the Senate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  With Mr. Gore and most other Southern Democrats voting for it, the Firearm Owners Protection Act, as it was known, sailed through the Senate by a 79-to-15 vote. To this day, Mr. Gore contends the act contained provisions that made it worth supporting, including tougher penalties for crimes committed with guns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  After enactment of the repeal measure, Mr. Gore continued to express skepticism about gun control, telling the magazine Washington Monthly in 1986 that ''gun laws haven't been an effective solution to the underlying problem of violent crime.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  When Mrs. Brady called Mr. Gore that year to solicit his support for the ban on plastic guns, he readily agreed. He was absent for the vote when the measure failed, but co-sponsored a similar bill the next year.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Republican opponents and other critics say Mr. Gore had an added motivation for switching sides just then: in the spring of 1987, he had jumped into the presidential campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Two leading Democratic candidates, Michael S. Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, were strong proponents of gun control, and, his critics assert, Mr. Gore was trolling for votes in New York and New England, places where regulating guns was popular. Mr. Gore denies that.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  His critics say Mr. Gore tried to have it both ways on the assault weapons ban, voting against an amendment to extend the ban to more weapons, then voting for the final bill. But gun control advocates call the amendment a ''poison pill'' that could have killed the overall bill.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In 1991, Mr. Gore co-sponsored a bill named after James Brady requiring a five-day waiting period for handgun buyers. Six years earlier, Mr. Gore had voted against similar legislation. This time, he rose to give one of his few floor speeches about gun control in 16 years in Congress.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Violence in this country and violence with guns is a problem that must be addressed not next month, not next year, but now,'' Mr. Gore said, in a losing cause.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But even as Mr. Gore was working for passage of the Brady bill in Washington, his staff was telling reporters in Tennessee that Mr. Gore was undecided about the measure, according to news accounts in Nashville papers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Both the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill were defeated in Congress those years. But in the Clinton administration, Congress passed both bills and they were signed into law. And last year, Mr. Gore cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate on legislation to require background checks for gun buyers at gun shows. That bill is now stalled in negotiations between the House and Senate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000

  Republicans say Mr. Gore's shifting views on gun control raise questions about his candidness and credibility. But gun control advocates say what matters most is that Mr. Gore is staunchly in their camp today.

  Bush Addresses Hispanic Group  Gov. George W. Bush told members of the National Council of La Raza, one of the nation's largest and most influential Hispanic groups, that he was on a mission to topple any stereotypes that Republicans are insensitive to minority groups and new immigrants.

  Governor Bush has also devoted considerable attention to education to woo swing voters and has proposed a five-year, $2.9 billion plan to improve teaching.

  Mr. Gore faces challenges Mr. Clinton did not. Unlike Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore has been lagging slightly behind his Republican opponent in recent polls, in part because Democrats are not rallying behind him as enthusiastically as Republicans are supporting Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. And, on his left, Mr. Gore has to contend with Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate running on the Green Party line. Mr. Nader is drawing about 5 percent in the polls, but some Gore supporters fear that, in a tight race, even a small percentage could hurt Mr. Gore in key states.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  So the vice president's advisers and Democratic supporters say the themes now being sounded by the vice president serve several purposes. For one, they are supposed to stoke the perception that Mr. Bush, whose campaign has raised record sums, is the candidate of the well off.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The tones also rally the Democratic faithful. Mr. Gore appeared today before some of his party's staunchest supporters, a teachers union gathering here in Philadelphia, and a conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Cincinnati. The audience at the American Federation of Teachers convention here was often cheering as Mr. Gore criticized the insurance industry or pledged to give all children health insurance. And though aides say it is not Mr. Gore's primary intent, the attack on corporate interests co-opts some of Mr. Nader's anti-corporate message.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  By portraying himself as a fighter for the common man against big business, Mr. Gore also takes one of his vulnerabilities -- that he can seem strident -- and tries to turn it into a plus. As he put it several times this week, ''The question is whether you're for the people or for the power.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''These issues are core Democratic issues,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, ''but they appeal to voters across the board.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  And Mr. Gore is no longer criticizing Mr. Bush head-on, the way he did in the spring when he spoke of Mr. Bush's ''risky'' tax scheme and criticized every Bush proposal. Instead, he goes after certain business interests that he then tries to link to either the Congressional Republicans or to Mr. Bush, or both.
 </textdata>
 <date>

 <textdata>
  In a letter to Citizens for Better Medicare that was distributed on his campaign plane, Mr. Gore challenged the group's leaders to make public its donor list and show who was behind it, saying, ''The American people deserve to know who exactly is trying to influence this critical issue.''.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In his appearance before the teachers, Mr. Gore said the group should be called Citizens for Bad Medicare, saying, ''That's what they are promoting -- our opponent's plan, which tells seniors to go beg the H.M.O.'s and the insurance companies with help with prescription drugs.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore was referring to the House Republicans' plan for a prescription drug benefit, which broadly follows principles Mr. Bush has set out. Their bill gives subsidies and incentives to insurance companies to provide drug coverage to Medicare recipients. Mr. Gore has a more expansive plan which would offer the benefits directly through the Medicare program.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Even as Mr. Gore was delivering his criticisms, Democratic officials sought to demonstrate ties between the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans. They said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant who helped produce the commercials for Citizens for Better Medicare, had ties to the Bush campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Castellanos's firm, National Media, had no part in the production of Mr. Bush's campaign advertisements.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One Bush adviser acknowledged that the company did buy media time  for the Bush campaign, but said Mr. Castellanos was on the ''creative side'' of the company and was not involved in buying time for the Bush commercials.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. McLellan accused Mr. Gore of trying to ''divert attention away from his Washington, D.C., one-size-fits-all'' approach to providing a drug benefit directly through the federal Medicare program. Mr. McClellan also accused three of Mr. Gore's friends and advisers -- Peter Knight, Tom Downey and Anthony Podesta -- of being drug industry lobbyists.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-6-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, however, noted that the vice president was acting in opposition to the drug industry despite the ties of some of his friends and advisers. But Mr. Lehane asserted that the Bush campaign was benefiting from the Citizens for Better Medicare advertisements, and was putting forward ''an agenda that is in the best interests of the pharmaceutical companies.''

  And both have engaged in a nasty war of words. The advertisers have accused the unions of illegally threatening to blackball nonunion actors who cross their picket lines. Actors have accused the advertisers of trying to destroy their unions. Producers who have chosen to film in the Los Angeles or New York areas have often faced interference from picketers. The unions say they have disrupted numerous shoots, including a campaign spot for Gov. George W. Bush.

  Checking Up on Cheney  A cardiac surgeon in Houston said that Gov. George W. Bush and his father, former President George Bush, had asked him on Friday to consult by telephone with one of Richard B. Cheney's physicians and help determine if Mr. Cheney ''was up to a strenuous campaign.'' Mr. Cheney, the former defense secretary, emerged in recent days as a leading contender for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket.

  But all of this could not have happened at a worse moment, just as Vice President Al Gore began paring down the list and getting serious about the search for his own vice president on the Democratic ticket.

  Already it has become the campaign that people like to complain about. Why isn't Vice President Al Gore less leaden and more popular within his own party? What does Gov. George W. Bush really mean by compassionate conservatism, and does he know enough to be president? Whoever wins, about half of the American people will blame the news media either for giving Mr. Gore a free ride on his campaign fund-raising past or for not quizzing Mr. Bush hard enough about foreign policy.

  These contrasting images are firmly fixed in the public perception, and they point us toward some reasons that with the convening of the Republican convention on July 31, we are going to see an even harsher campaign than anyone expected. The crowning reason for this is that the race is much more competitive than it appeared a few weeks ago. Even though Mr. Gore has been struggling, the national polls last week closed to within a couple of points. And as Richard Berke and Adam Clymer showed in an electoral-vote analysis in The Times on Friday, the contest looks even closer when viewed as a showdown for a handful of swing states including Michigan, Missouri, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Slim margins in a few crucial states produce mean campaigns.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But that is only part of the story. The personalities of the candidates and their strategic imperatives also play a role. The Bush campaign has to sell a candidate whom people like but view as untested and too much a product of easy street. The Gore campaign has to promote a candidate with plenty of baggage and a considerable ability to irritate people, even within his party's core constituencies. If likability and baggage are allowed to remain key issues, Mr. Gore suffers. If experience and policy expertise come to the fore, Mr. Bush gets in trouble, a key reason for Mr. Gore's renewed assault on the governor's record in Texas.

  If a contest becomes focused on pocketbook concerns, social issues and ideology, voters tend to scurry back to their home parties. Suburban Republicans really do like tax cuts. Pro-choice women really do have to worry about what a Bush victory would do to the Supreme Court. Mr. Gore needs a big Democratic homecoming, since vice presidents running to keep their parties in power have a hard time attracting crossover voters. In practical terms, that means Mr. Gore needs to have his current poll number, around 41 percent, up to 47 to 49 percent by Election Day. Political professionals will be watching Mr. Bush's post-convention polls to assess the bounce he gets from his television time and his carefully orchestrated vice-presidential search. In the run-up to the election, the most striking point of agreement between strategists in both parties is that the winner will have a very narrow margin. The outcome may depend on whether the fervent Mr. Gore or the more laid-back Mr. Bush is better at making voters comfortable with personal images that are firmly and probably unalterably fixed in the public consciousness.

  Mr. Cheney, the former defense secretary and the man supervising the process by which Governor Bush chooses a running mate, emerged over the last two days as a leading contender for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket. And one reason many Republican officials were surprised by that development was Mr. Cheney's health. More than a decade ago, he had three mild heart attacks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Mr. Cheney has apparently not had any heart trouble in recent years, and Dr. Cooley said that he told both of the Bushes, who placed separate calls to him, that Mr. Cheney's physician in Washington ''thought he was certainly capable and fit enough to go through a national campaign.'' Dr. Cooley added that the governor and former president both seemed pleased by that news.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dr. Cooley's actions, first reported today by ABC News, were yet another sign of the seriousness with which Mr. Cheney, whom one high-ranking Republican official described today as the front-runner to share the Republican ticket with Governor Bush, is being considered for the job. On the same day that the Bushes were reaching out to Dr. Cooley, Mr. Cheney changed his voter registration from Texas to Wyoming, a state he represented in Congress for many years, thereby eliminating a potential constitutional hurdle to being the vice-presidential nominee.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Additionally, the way in which Dr. Cooley's help was solicited raised questions about the extent of President Bush's involvement in his son's deliberations over a running mate. The Texas governor said on Friday that his father, in whose administration Mr. Cheney served as the defense secretary, had mainly played the role of ''a good listener.''
 </textdata>
 <date>

  Asked tonight about President Bush's role, Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign, said, ''Only the governor can answer that question, and I'm sure he will be happy to once the process is complete.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ms. Hughes said she could neither confirm nor deny that Dr. Cooley had acted on the Bushes' request to help assess Mr. Cheney's health. Referring to the various people whose names have been floated as vice-presidential prospects for Mr. Bush, Ms. Hughes said, ''I think it's important to respect the privacy of all these individuals until such time as Governor Bush makes a decision.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One adviser to Mr. Bush said tonight that the governor had not contacted any of his closest aides or anyone on his list of potential vice presidents to say that he had made his decision, which he is expected to announce sometime this week. The comments of several of Mr. Bush's advisers pointed to Tuesday as the likeliest day for that announcement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush spent today in the peace, quiet and seclusion of his ranch about 90 miles northwest of here, and he did not plan to return to Austin, where the announcement will almost certainly be made, until midday Monday, his aides said. Mr. Bush said on Friday that he would spend the weekend making final deliberations.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One of his aides cautioned anew today that despite all the speculation about Mr. Cheney and, to a lesser extent, about former Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, with whom the Texas governor met for several hours on Tuesday, Mr. Bush might yet have a surprise in store. But a high-ranking Republican official said Mr. Cheney appeared to be the leading candidate.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There were other possible indicators that Mr. Cheney might be Mr. Bush's pick. One Republican official said that before Dr. Cooley's telephone call Mr. Cheney had undergone a thorough physical examination last week.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Several of Mr. Bush's senior advisers and other prominent Republicans fanned out on the morning news programs, where much of what they said amounted to defenses of potential criticisms of Mr. Cheney's selection and arguments for why Mr. Cheney represented a terrific choice. They repeatedly said, however, that Mr. Bush had not made a decision.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  On CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, said that Mr. Cheney's history of heart trouble was not cause for concern. ''Those heart attacks occurred in the 70's and 80's, and he then served as secretary of defense in President Bush's administration and presided over Desert Storm,'' Mr. Rove noted.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The three heart attacks, in 1978, 1984 and 1988, that Mr. Cheney, 59, suffered were all mild, and he had bypass surgery in 1988, before his high-profile assignment in the Bush administration. Mr. Cheney had previously served as President Gerald Ford's chief of staff.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Dr. Cooley said that what the Bushes wanted to know about Mr. Cheney was ''how fit he was and was he up to a strenuous campaign.'' Dr. Cooley concluded that he was.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Although Mr. Cheney and Mr. Danforth, 63, are in many ways dissimilar, both have decades of government experience that stand in bold counterpoint to Mr. Bush's five and a half years as Texas governor, the only office he has held. Some Republican strategists said today that the willingness of Mr. Bush, 54, to turn to older political veterans suggested how confident and comfortable he was with his own abilities.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But others said it was a possible sign that Mr. Bush or his advisers were acting to blunt any concerns among voters that Mr. Bush did not have enough seasoning to lead the country.

  Both camps say the sharp differences between the major presidential candidates this year are helping to energize supporters. Vice President Al Gore has called for an array of new restrictions, including licensing new handgun buyers and banning certain inexpensive handguns. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has generally sided with the N.R.A., signing bills allowing people to carry concealed weapons and preventing municipalities from suing gun makers.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Much as the N.R.A. has tried to demonize Mr. Gore in its fund-raising efforts as a threat to Second Amendment rights, Handgun Control has sought to cast Mr. Bush as a pawn of the N.R.A. who would team up with a Congress controlled by Republicans to rescind every major gun law on the books.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In a recent fund-raising letter, Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control, wrote: ''My friend, if you and I truly want a safer America, we cannot allow George W. Bush to be elected president of the United States. A political disaster of that magnitude would mean four long years of being on the defensive.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Among the Republicans Handgun Control is likely to work against are Representative James E. Rogan of California and Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The group has also run advertisements in several cities criticizing Mr. Bush's record on gun control, and plans to buy more air time in closely contested states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Missouri.

 </textdata>

  The issue flared, briefly but bitterly, on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' today, when Robert Shrum, an adviser to Vice President Al Gore, said Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was giving short shrift to the plight of the elderly. Mr. Shrum said Democrats wanted a drug plan ''that provides for all senior citizens under Medicare,'' while Governor Bush ''wants one that lets seniors go out and beg the H.M.O.'s and insurance companies for coverage.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Karen P. Hughes, the spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, countered that Mr. Gore had ignored ''bipartisan opportunities'' to pass drug legislation, and said that Mr. Bush was ''committed to reforming and modernizing Medicare to provide prescription drug coverage.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Geoffrey Garin, a chief pollster for House Democrats, argued, ''George W. Bush has been trying very hard and with some success to avoid any debate about big philosophical questions, but Medicare really is a chance for Democrats to raise a question about the role of government versus the private sector, on a topic where voters have already made a pretty clear decision.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the presidential campaign, the contrast is not as clear, largely because Governor Bush has remained vague on Medicare issues. For example, when asked Mr. Bush's position on the Medicare prescription drug bill recently passed by his party in the House, Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that Mr. Bush ''wants to review the final Congressional product.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush and his spokesmen have also talked approvingly of the work of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, and faulted the administration for blocking its work -- although the commission was advocating a market-oriented plan that by some estimates could have made it significantly more costly for the elderly to stay with traditional fee-for-service Medicare, and raised the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 from 65.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Still, the specifics of Mr. Bush's thinking on Medicare may not come until this fall's debates, when Mr. Gore is sure to raise it.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore is also committed to the ''modernization'' proposals put forth by the Clinton administration, which try to inject more competition among health plans while protecting the fee-for-service program.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-24-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  In the end, Medicare may turn out to be much more of an issue in Congressional elections than in the presidential contest. Several health policy analysts noted that Mr. Bush was far more willing to plunge into the politics of Social Security than Medicare, which remains among the most popular government initiatives. Even so, analysts maintain, this election has big consequences for the program, which was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson as the centerpiece of the Great Society.
 </textdata>
 <date>

  To get a sense of how dizzily out of whack things have become, all you have to do is consider that George W. Bush's proposed tax cut is $1.3 trillion. There is no way the non-Social Security surpluses projected over the next decade would be able to cover tax cuts of that magnitude.

  By last fall, Mr. Bowlin and Mayor John Kunkel realized that another water source would be needed to prevent an emergency. But the town had floated bonds in the 1980's to build its pumping system and could not afford the money for a new pipeline. So it went looking for money, and received a $200,000 federal grant. It also received a state grant in June, and Gov. George W. Bush declared the town a disaster area. The state grant included $800,000 for materials but required that Throckmorton provide the labor.

  Swing states in the presidential race like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and Washington are all rated as tossups or moving only marginally toward Mr. Bush, who is strongest in the South and Rocky Mountain states, or toward Mr. Gore, whose support is heaviest on the East and West coasts.

  In the meantime, Mr. Gore was making his case for the presidency in Mr. Bush's own backyard, traveling to Texas to criticize his rival's reign as governor, which got some Texans' dander up.

  So it is no surprise that Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore are making overtures to immigrant communities that may provide the swing vote in California, Texas, Florida and New York. But they are doing so in an atmosphere far calmer than in the mid-1990's, when immigrant-bashing was in vogue and Gov. Pete Wilson of California pushed successfully for Proposition 187, which prohibited illegal immigrants from attending public schools and getting social services.

  But Mr. Bush is not expected to make a final decision until Sunday night, and Republicans close to the campaign, along with Mr. Bush's advisers, have cautioned that it is still impossible to predict with any certainty what Mr. Bush will do. High-ranking Republicans also said today that Mr. Cheney and Mr. Danforth might not be the only prospects that Mr. Bush was considering. Mr. Bush's aides have said that the governor would most likely announce his decision next week, probably no earlier than Tuesday. But the aides declined to indulge any speculation about whom Mr. Bush might choose.

  In June, Mr. Danforth, who retired from the Senate in 1994 after 18 years there, apparently withdrew himself from consideration, saying that he would prefer not to be offered the job. But his long meeting with Mr. Bush in a Chicago hotel on Tuesday, which was first reported by ABC News, suggested either that his resistance had softened or that he was leaving some room open to be persuaded to become the Texas governor's running mate if Mr. Bush asked him.
 </textdata>

 <textdata>
  Several knowledgeable Republicans said that Mr. Danforth's wife, Sally, was also present, and that Mr. Cheney, in his role as chief of the selection process, attended part of the meeting as well. Mr. Danforth was the only potential vice-presidential candidate, in addition to Mr. Cheney, with whom Mr. Bush has met over the last week.

  But since the exit of John McCain, who managed to make campaign finance reform seem romantic, it's been hard to find real human passion anywhere but on a fictional TV drama.  It's impossible to tell what George W. Bush and Al Gore really care about, besides not making mistakes.

  ''America should import the British system for one convention week. You have the two parties on opposite sides of a big convention center, like  Parliament, jeering, pointing across the aisle, while Bush and Gore debate each other extemporaneously.

  Correction:  July 26, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about a festival in Bloomington, Ind., to celebrate the publication centennial of the Oz books truncated the original title. It was ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'' The article also gave a misspelled surname in some copies for an actor who played a Munchkin in the 1939 movie based on it. He is Clarence Swensen, not Swenson. In some copies the article also misspelled the name of the theater where a play, ''Oz,'' was staged as part of the festival. It is the Buskirk-Chumley, not Bushkirt-Chumley.

  Asked the other day how the Gore campaign was shaping up, he told The Courier-Journal of Louisville that the vice president's problems in Kentucky, as in the nation as a whole, were largely traceable to a lack of personality. Simple as that.

  ''What he has to do right now,'' Mr. Patton said, ''is he's got to bring George W. Bush's record out. We're exactly where we were in 1988, with a sitting vice president and an attractive governor who can make a good speech -- and you know who won that one.''

  A July 21 letter concludes that if George W.

  Go to work, watch the news: the sound of institutions competing to be ''family friendly'' can be deafening. ''Let us create a family lobby as powerful as the gun lobby,'' Al Gore says, and every issue, from gun control to tax reform, is now presented as being good for children. The unintended result of all this is that the 13 million childless baby boomers are left bristling because their lives -- whether chosen or the result of circumstance -- don't seem to count. This simmering resentment might not qualify as a ''movement'' (a word that is thrown around too often, as if anger does not exist unless it is organized), but it certainly represents a deep divide and a ripe opportunity for sniping between neighbors, between co-workers, between those who have and those who have no interest.

  The Secret Service was worried enough about the difficulties in securing Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles that it moved Vice President Al Gore from the Biltmore Hotel there to Century City, several miles away from the convention site.

  For their part, Democratic Party officials and aides to Mr. Gore are having to walk a delicate line between making sure their typically fractious party is not seen as trying to stifle peaceful protests, while exercising diplomacy with a police department and local establishment whose help they need to have a successful convention.

  As a political heir, Al Gore would be hard pressed to produce a platform that matched Mr. Clinton's in sweep and novelty. His draft platform's most surprising element is the number of positions that dart to the left of the Clinton administration. For example, the 1992 platform emphasized the wonder of world trade; the 2000 draft emphasizes protecting American jobs.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  George W. Bush's draft platform will almost certainly try to placate the Republican right while reaching out to disaffected moderates. Just as Mr. Clinton borrowed from earlier Republicans, Mr. Bush may find himself consulting the president's 1992 playbook for hints on how to move the Republican image toward the center.
 </textdata>

  But Governor Bush can find an even more irresistible model in his own family history. When Eisenhower ran for re-election in 1956, he asked his platform committee chairman to engineer a centrist document. Ike wanted to banish the memory of the hard-right platform of 1952, demanded by his rival, Robert Taft, which had embarrassed him. Eisenhower also wished to counter what he privately considered to be the troglodyte Republican leaders of Congress.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Ike did not call his doctrine ''compassionate conservatism.'' He called it ''modern Republicanism.'' But the idea was roughly the same. The platform chairman Eisenhower put on the case was his frequent golfing partner, the senator from Connecticut and the grandfather of this year's presidential nominee: Prescott Bush.

  In 1988, President Reagan symbolically passed the torch of leadership to Vice President George Bush in a brief ceremony at an Air Force Base near the convention in New Orleans.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But unlike the 1988 event, the Democrats said Mr. Clinton's appearance would be substantive and extensive. Though aides want to use the convention to move Mr. Gore out of the president's shadow, Mr. Clinton remains very popular with many Democrats, and the Gore campaign does not want to appear to be shunting him to the side.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000

 <textdata>
  The convention's overall themes, ''Progress and Prosperity'' and ''People, not the Powerful,'' have been drawn from the oratory of Mr. Gore's recent campaign appearances, where he has attacked big oil and drug companies and his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, saying Mr. Bush is beholden to special interests.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Gore would spend the first three days of the convention campaigning around the country. Because the television networks are not planning to devote much prime time coverage to the convention, the Gore campaign planned to use the vice president's off-convention events to try to pick up additional television coverage.

  Mr. Nader -- whose words, though not his speaking style, are laced with emotion -- then laid into Vice President Al Gore and other Democrats, saying they have done little for labor because they have been able to take labor's support for granted.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  This outpouring of enthusiasm for Mr. Nader worries many Democrats, who fear that so many steelworkers, auto workers, teamsters and other union members will vote for him this fall that Mr. Gore could lose in Ohio and other Midwestern swing states. For the Democrats, an added concern is that two of the most powerful unions in the Midwest, the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, have flirted with Mr. Nader and have not endorsed Mr. Gore, even though the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is backing the vice president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Many steelworkers are still angry at Mr. Gore because he backed the agreement to normalize trade relations with China, which many union members fear will accelerate the exodus of American factories to China. Although Mr. Nader is best known for his crusading on consumer protection and the environment, he has grown closer to labor unions in recent years, fighting with them against the China trade deal, the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  All the steelworkers here hailed Mr. Nader, but several said they would still vote for Mr. Gore because they feared Gov. George W. Bush would win if Mr. Nader drained too many votes from the vice president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The excitement generated by Mr. Nader also concerns some labor leaders. John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, has repeatedly urged union members to back Mr. Gore, saying it is important to prevent Mr. Bush from winning because working with a Republican Congress, he might push through legislation to weaken unions and job safety laws.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America, was one of labor's most vociferous critics of the China deal, but he says it is time to line up behind Mr. Gore. He said in an interview that labor's support for Mr. Nader was modest and would grow smaller, and he predicted that many union members leaning toward Mr. Nader would ultimately vote for Mr. Gore upon realizing that Mr. Nader cannot win.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''There are two viable candidates, Al Gore and George W. Bush, and we're picking the one closest to the viewpoints of our members and the issues of working people,'' Mr. Becker said. ''Nader's a fine man. He takes a lot of positions that are near and dear to us. But he is not a viable candidate. In that regard, anybody who would support Ralph Nader we think would lessen Al Gore's chances of winning.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  David Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said that the race between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush was close in his state, but that he did not think Mr. Nader would hurt the vice president. Recent polls show Mr. Nader getting 4 percent of the vote in Ohio, compared with more than 10 percent in California, but Mr. Leland said those were high-water marks that were bound to fall.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Most people know a vote for Ralph Nader is a wasted vote at best and a vote for George Bush at worst,'' he said.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Becker said he hoped Mr. Gore would become more outspoken on workers' issues to excite union members about his candidacy. Indeed, on Monday, Mr. Gore is scheduled to hold a town hall meeting in Cleveland with 75 steelworkers from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Illinois.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Asserting that he should be included in any presidential debates, Mr. Nader said he would seek to force Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush to address work-related issues, like occupational safety, that have been largely ignored during the campaign.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  ''Gore will tell you, 'I'm for you. I'm going to fight for you. I'm for a ban on using replacement workers in strikes,' '' Mr. Nader said. ''But what has he done in eight years? I don't care what you're for. I want to know what you've done. Talk is cheap.''

  But this time, advisers to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas say he seems to be steering clear of the glamour and gloss -- and more toward the safe and solid.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  As Mr. Bush secludes himself at his Texas ranch this weekend to make up his mind on his most momentous campaign decision so far, a leading choice, his advisers say, is Richard B. Cheney.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  It could be, of course, that Mr. Bush is using the speculation over Mr. Cheney as a distraction while he readies his true decision -- and has a colossal surprise in mind. Maybe (with help from his father) he can persuade Gen. Colin L. Powell after all. Maybe there is even a mystery selection.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  But Bush advisers and friends of General Powell insist that he is not interested, leaving the focus on Mr. Cheney and others.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  That may be by design. Mr. Bush's advisers say the governor is so confident he will win that he is focused less on bald electoral calculations for Nov. 7 -- like whether his running mate would make a state more competitive -- and more on whom he wants beside him on Jan. 20, when he expects to be sworn in as the next president.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The announcement of Mr. Bush's choice is not expected before Tuesday.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another reason Mr. Bush appears less concerned about a No. 2 with pizazz is his recognition that, thanks to Bill Clinton, the role of the vice president has broadened. In picking Al Gore, Mr. Clinton made the vice presidency more than an understudy's job. It is now one that voters expect to be filled with a person of substance.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush himself made clear this week that he was looking beyond Election Day.  ''There's been the time in the past where people, competent people, said, 'Well, let's just pick the vice president. Don't worry, we'll dump him once we get elected,' '' Mr. Bush said on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Bush may be moving toward a less flashy choice because there are only so many flashy possibilities. Several advisers agreed that there was only one marquee candidate who would add value to the ticket -- General Powell -- and that Mr. Bush would snap him up if he thought General Powell was interested. Many advisers said Senator McCain would also enliven the ticket, but they questioned how well Mr. Bush would tolerate Mr. McCain only 18 steps from the back door of the Oval Office. Some Bush friends also said the governor would cringe at the perception that he was forced to turn to Mr. McCain to assure victory.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Kemp suggested that if Mr. Bush were able to get General Powell, that might not be a panacea. ''The fact that he doesn't want it,'' he said, ''makes them want him even more.''
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If Mr. Bush picked Mr. Cheney, he would win plaudits from Republicans who think Mr. Cheney would bring dignity, weight and foreign policy skills to the ticket. And while he has a solidly conservative voting record in Congress, Mr. Cheney has always worked well with moderates.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Since 1995, Mr. Cheney has headed Halliburton, an energy services and construction company. He served as President Gerald R. Ford's chief of staff, then was a congressman from 1979-1989. He then was President Bush's defense secretary, where he was a major figure in the Persian Gulf war.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Others warned that Mr. Cheney, 59, is from a small state, Wyoming, that is already a safe bet for Mr. Bush to win. And, they said, he is risky because of his health: he has had three heart attacks.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  If he picks Mr. Keating, Mr. Bush would win raves from Republicans who admire Mr. Keating's handling of the Oklahoma City bombing and his credentials as a former prosecutor. Another plus is that he is Roman Catholic, and Mr. Bush has been trying to reassure Catholics after opponents suggested he was anti-Catholic. Others warn that he is from a state that is safely Republican and that his conservative background would not broaden the ticket.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  There are pros and cons to the other prospects. Governor Ridge, for one, has a riveting rags-to-respectability biography and could help carry his battleground state. But some conservatives would deride his abortion rights stand. Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska has a compelling military record and he has the foreign policy expertise that Mr. Bush lacks. But he is relatively green on the national stage.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Mr. Pataki hails from a big state, but not even his own advisers predict that he could deliver it to the Republicans. A seemingly trivial factor is that Mr. Pataki stands about a half-foot taller than Mr. Bush, and nominees never like being overshadowed.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  Another possibility is Representative John Kasich of Ohio, who would bring vitality and a knowledge of Congress. But he has what some Bush advisers say is the Quayle problem: he exudes youthfulness -- and seems to lack gravitas.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  One who clearly has star quality is Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He was a movie actor, after all. But some Bush advisers express concern that as a single man, Mr. Thompson would not project the appropriate family image.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  The new imperatives for a running mate have made the selection process complicated, if not confounding. Mr. Bush, and Mr. Gore, face often conflicting pressures: they want running mates who can be effective on the stump and in governing. They want someone who can excite party members but also attract independents.
 </textdata>
 <date>
  7-23-2000
 </date>
 <textdata>
  They also want drama. But they have to be mindful that reaching for the spectacular can be like a blind date with history. The result can be fresh and intoxicating -- like Mr. Gore eight years ago -- or disastrous.

  When Mr. Mondale picked Ms. Ferraro, he thought she would be an instant draw for women. He was wrong. Four years later, the elder Bush thought voters would find Mr. Quayle fresh and exciting. They did not, but the ticket won anyway.

  The selection of Quayle did carry shock value. He was so little known, even by Mr. Bush's own aides, that in New Orleans, the convention site, they busily photocopied his biography in the Almanac of American Politics so they could brief reporters on him.

  Governor Bush's aides said their candidate has learned from his father's experience that he need not be fixated on springing a surprise (though he does like surprises) and that, more important, the campaign has to be well prepared before announcing the choice. Mr. Bush also learned a lesson from watching his father serve as Ronald Reagan's No. 2 for eight years: he wants someone who is as faithful to him as his father was to Mr. Reagan but who also offers sound advice and does not stir the pot.

  Today, Governor Bush and more than 50 senators and representatives from both parties -- including Senators Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts -- joined 900 other mourners in an emotional memorial to a man who defied the bitter political partisanship that grips the Capitol today. President Bush did not attend, but his tribute was read by a family friend of the Coverdells in the packed Peachtree United Methodist Church in the fashionable Buckhead section of town.

  ''He loved politics and was a clear example of politics being a noble calling,'' President Bush wrote. ''He leaves behind a legacy that quiet is good, caring about the other guy matters.''

  On a day of celebrating Mr. Coverdell's life, even the fevered pitch of the presidential campaign was temporarily laid aside. Before and after the service, Governor Bush declined to comment on reports that Richard B. Cheney, the former secretary of defense, had risen to the top of his list of potential running mates.

  Lawmakers attending the service, including other Republican vice presidential candidates like Fred Thompson of Tennessee and John McCain of Arizona, were whisked to waiting cars or buses. But one Senate Republican, Mike DeWine of Ohio, said a Bush-Cheney ticket this fall would be a winning combination.  ''Dick Cheney has got what it takes,'' Mr. DeWine said.

  The Clinton administration endorses some of these steps, while Gov. George W. Bush emphasizes tax cuts that would leave low-income workers with more take-home pay. But college has become the favored approach, the one that business most applauds. Nearly $13 billion in federal funding has gone this year into college scholarships and tax credits for college tuition. Mr. Bush favors similar subsidies and so does Vice President Al Gore.

  WELL SET TO ADVERTISE -- The Republican and Democratic national parties reported healthy bank balances on June 30 as they entered the final pre-election stretch. The Republican National Committee reported $53.4 million cash on hand after having raised $86.6 million since Jan. 1. The Democratic National Committee said it had $35 million in the bank; it has raised $64.4 million so far this year. The parties benefited from lucrative fund-raising dinners featuring their leaders. A dinner honoring Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in April brought in $21 million; a Democratic salute to President Clinton a month later yielded $27 million. Both parties said their June 30 figures were the largest ever at this stage of a campaign and promised to use their wealth to finance aggressive television advertising campaigns on behalf of their candidates and issues.

  ADS ATTACK BUSH ON ABORTION -- Planned Parenthood will run $2.5 million in television advertising to spotlight Gov. George W. Bush's anti-abortion views, hoping to reach independent and Republican women who support abortion rights. The group says its research suggests that many women respect Planned Parenthood but are leaning toward Mr. Bush. ''We're focusing on those 'compassionate conservative' Republican and independent women who are very pro-choice,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the group's political arm. ''They believe us when we tell them about George W. Bush's position. These are the women who elected Bill Clinton twice.'' The first advertisement will run nationally on cable television, beginning on Monday and extending through the Republican National Convention, July 31 to Aug. 3.

  LEADING UP TO A FUND-RAISER -- The Democratic National Committee plans to cap the end of its national nominating convention in Los Angeles next month by raising $2 million for its candidates. The Republican National Committee is also planning a major fund-raiser near the end of its gathering in Philadelphia. All of the money raised at the Democratic fund-raiser will be spent on advertising and other activities urging voters to support Democratic candidates, from Vice President Al Gore on down. The Republican National Committee has not said how much it expects to raise at its event or how it will be spent. Tickets for the Republican event will start at $1,000.

  They also said that Mr. Pataki's breakfast meeting with Mr. Bush, in a hotel suite in Newark, where Mr. Bush was campaigning, came after Mr. Pataki had received one of the questionnaires that the Bush campaign distributed to possible running mates and after the New York governor had spoken on the telephone several weeks ago with Richard B. Cheney, the former defense secretary, who is supervising the selection process for Mr. Bush.
